Look around you .
Everything moves , everything revolves .
This is how we are born .
The sun , the moon , the planets and the stars look at it .
And we are in the middle .
Our location .
But Nicholas Copernicus came and assumed that the sun was in the middle , and we would circle the sun .
Just like the other planets .
An Earth that moves ?
But surely we don &apos;t see or feel any of that ?
That was in 1543 .
Galileo made a telescope and aimed for the starry sky for the first time in 1610 .
He spotted moons at Jupiter and saw them orbiting the planet over the course of hours and days .
Later Christiaan Huygens and Dominique Cassini also discovered moons near the planet Saturn .
Everything revolves around something else .
Should it be true ?
Johannes Kepler described these movements , and Isaac Newton caught them .
From apple to planet : everything followed its laws .
And us ?
We got used to it and knew nothing else but that the sun was in the middle and we were orbiting it .
And the stars you see ?
The band of nebula @-@ like light , the Milky Way ?
All cultures had given them a special meaning :
For the Egyptians it was wheat of Isis , the Incas saw golden star dust in it , the Eskimos a snowpath , the Christians the way to Rome .
It turned out that this Milky Way also consisted of stars :
of hundreds , thousands , millions of stars .
And then they discovered that there were also small mists .
Some spiral , others oval or uneven .
Where should they go ?
How does it all fit together ?
We , the stars , the Milky Way , the nebulae ?
In the middle of the 19th century it was known that all these points of light are actually suns .
That they had to be far away .
That the sun is a star that is very close .
And that was the universe : this multitude of stars .
And our position in it ?
Spiral Galaxy The Milky Way unravels
A film by Maarten Roos in collaboration with Pieter- Rim de Kroon
In the middle of the 19th century , the advent of photography brought a major change in astronomical perception techniques .
Before that , astronomers had visually determined the positions and brightness of all stars in the northern sky , without photography .
With a telescope one looked at the whole sky and wrote down the position and brightness for each star .
So you have made an inventory until a certain brightness .
Such an inventory was called a survey .
When photography had taken hold , there was an astronomer in the southern hemisphere who said :
&apos;Let &apos;s do for the southern sky the equivalent of what was done for the northern sky , but with photography . &apos;
This astronomer was the director of the Cape of Good Hope Observatory , David Gill .
I am sitting here by a photographic telescope , similar to the one used by David Gill .
When taking photos , the telescope must remain in the same position in the sky .
You have to make sure that the telescope follows the daily movement of the sky very precisely .
There is then a part in which the photographic plate was located , for example here .
This is the combustion area of the telescope .
At the same time there is another telescope down here to keep an eye on the sky
So you look here to see if the telescope follows the sky correctly . At the same time , the other part sometimes photographs with very long exposure times - the same part of the sky .
This can take a few minutes , maybe even longer .
When it is finished you have to take the plate out , aim for another piece of the sky , insert a new photographic plate ;
and so it goes on until you have covered the whole sky with photographic plates .
So Gill started with that big project of photographing the southern sky .
However , he did not immediately think how he measured the plates .
Around the same time , the astronomer Kapteyn was appointed professor of astronomy in Groningen ( Netherlands ) .
It was expected that there would soon be a large telescope , but for reasons not very clear , it did not come to that .
As Kapteyn thought :
There &apos;s got to be enough useful stuff to do without a telescope . &apos;
This is how the idea came about to work with David Gill and help him with the enormous measurement work of the record collection .
They corresponded about this and that soon led to an agreement :
Kapteyn would make it his job to measure the plates , while Gill would record more plates .
One may wonder whether the two of them were aware of the tremendous work they were doing .
Kapteyn , full of enterprise , worked for many years until he was finished .
It was finally published as three very thick volumes , which can be found at the Groningen Astronomical Institute .
In it there is almost nothing but columns with numbers that say which stars were recorded on the plates , how healthy they were and where in the sky they stood .
This great work has become known as Cape Photography Survey .
So this is the first monumental work with which Kapteyn has distinguished himself .
However , he must have also thought of all kinds of other problems of astronomy .
In particular , this was the characteristics of the large cluster of stars that we perceive in the sky as the Milky Way .
He made an important discovery in this area around 1904 .
He discovered that the stars do not just move so crisscross , but that there were preferential directions .
This was a very impressive discovery for the astronomical world , that there was regularity , on which one had always assumed that it was simply chaos !
It is precisely because of this that he has received even more recognition and has built more confidence into his plans to carry out further research into the Milky Way system in cooperation with foreign institutes .
At the end of his effective life Kapteyn created a model
of what the great swarm of stars of which we are a part actually looked like .
In the model , all the perceptions he had collected over the years fit in as well as possible .
These were perceptions of the distance and movement of the stars .
We now call this the Kapteyn model .
This model could be compared to a thick disk .
Within this disk , the density in which the stars appeared was greatest .
The closer you got to the edge of this pane , the smaller the tightness .
From the center to the edge , it was 30,000 light @-@ years away .
This means that the light needs 30,000 years to bridge this gap .
In the vertical direction of the disk , this distance was smaller , about 7,000 light years .
So this is a model that is easy to understand .
And Kapteyn must have found it a great success that , after all these years of research , he had finally developed a model of which he said :
Jacobus Kapleyns has found a model for space :
a disk with the sun about in the middle .
This also explained the Milky Way well .
However , there were other scientists who had a different opinion .
Perceptions showed that the universe had to be much bigger .
This created a huge debate in the 1920s .
It also became clear that all the spiral nebulae had to be many times further away than the boundaries of the Kapteyn universe .
Slowly , this larger vision prevailed .
Also the assumption became stronger that we are also in a flat spiral nebula .
And that the sun does not stand in the middle .
At the end of the 1920s , the young astronomer Jan Oort derived the rotation of our Milky Way system from the movements of stars near the Sun .
This could also explain the star streams discovered by Kapteyn at the beginning of the 20th century .
But how could we get a final impression of our entire Milky Way system ?
Large amounts of dust between the stars prevented a clear view of more distant areas and the center .
Twenty years of searching for an answer .
I was an astronomy student , and of course also studied mathematics and physics .
In April / March 1943 , all students were to sign a declaration of loyalty to the German occupation .
If you didn &apos;t want that , you had to go to work in Germany .
No student wanted that , and they had to hide .
That &apos;s easy to say , but where were they hiding ?
In a farm , but I did not know a farmer .
Or in the north @-@ east polder , where many students had been hiding ?
I had the chance to hide here in this observatory , together with another student , Hans Hubenet .
We arrived here in May 1943 .
We sat down in a small room , door closed , curtains tight , and we were quiet all day .
After 6 o &apos;clock in the evening , when the staff of the observatory were gone , we could get out , but at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning we did not have to be in the room .
And it went on day by day .
Equally , we were in a scientific environment , so I couldn &apos;t think of a better place to hide .
There were a few other students .
Hans and I were the only ones hiding . There was a student who was three years older ,
Henk van de Hulst .
Henk only had to take his final exam , but the university was closed .
Henk had one big advantage : he was an assistant in the observatory .
His ID card said &apos; assistant &apos; and mine said &apos; student &apos; .
And the Germans caught the students .
But an &apos; assistant could be assistant accountant or assistant pharmacist ... he could be anything .
So Henk moved quite freely .
Early 1944 something happened that we found very special .
Henk received an invitation from Prof. Oort , the director of Leiden Observatory , to work with him for a few months .
Today this is quite normal , but then it was whether to go to another continent .
The contacts were strange .
So Henk went to Leiden , and now and then we got news about the people and the events that happened there .
After a few months Henk came back with a very strange story .
Oort told Henk this in the years before the war ,
American physicists and engineers had discovered radio emission from space .
It was totally new and never heard of .
Where does the radio emission come from ?
Oort also wanted to catch the emission in the Netherlands and investigate , immediately after the war .
He said : &apos; It would be scientifically interesting if there was a wavelength where there was more radio emission than at other wavelengths .
That &apos;s when you could focus on it . &apos;
And he asked Henk :
&apos;Henk , you &apos;re going back to Utrecht now .
Could you analyse this hypothesis to see if there is a wavelength where there is more radio emission than at other wavelengths ? &apos;
And so we heard , hidden here , this story
We asked Henk what he would do next , and Henk said he would talk to Professor Rosenfeld .
Rosenfeld was a Belgium professor of theoretical physics , a master in quantum mechanics , etc .
So , Henk went to Rosenfeld .
Rosenfeld asked :
&apos;What &apos;s the most abundant gas or element in space ? &apos;
Answer : &apos; Well , Professor . &apos;
&apos;So , &apos; he said , &apos; then we have to start with hydrogen , and that &apos;s just because hydrogen is the simplest atom . &apos;
It consists of an electric charged proton at the center , and an electric charged electron that orbits the proton like a planet around the sun .
They both also rotate on their axis .
You can do it the same way , or the opposite way .
In the first case , the system has more energy than in the second .
When the electron turns around ,
When the electron turns around , and this is emitted like radio emission .
And Rosenfeld said , &apos; Henk , calculate the wavelength at which the emission is emitted . &apos;
That &apos;s not hard to make a quick calculation .
And the answer was : 21 cm !
So at a wavelength of 21 cm we can expect a stronger emission than at any other wavelength .
But the question is , &apos; Can we measure this emission ?
&apos;Because Rosenfeld also quickly calculated that the chance of an electron turning around is very small .
This happens once every ten million years per hydrogen atom !
Imagine that , tens of millions of years .
And when you hear that , you think , &apos; No chance !
But there is so much hydrogen in space that if all these small chances add up there can be a measurable emission .
Henk continued his research to determine how much radiation could be expected , concluding : &apos; Yes , it is possible . &apos;
In April 1944 there was a meeting of the Dutch Astronomers Club , the Association of Professional Astronomers .
They meet three times a year , now and then .
But in 1944 there were only a few participants , there were hardly any students , because it was difficult to travel during the war .
At this meeting Henk presented his prediction :
We can expect radio emission from space at a wavelength of 21 cm and we , in the Netherlands , should make an effort to detect it , discover it .
Henk van de Hulst &apos;s prediction was and remains a prediction .
Scientific experiments were not possible , especially if it smelled of radio communication .
But if it were true , if this radio radiation really existed , it would have been an enormous help in exploring the Milky Way system .
Radiation of this wavelength has little or no impediment to dust in the Milky Way , and could reach us from all parts of the Milky Way system !
Right after the war , Oort wanted to build a large radio telescope with an average of 25 meters .
But industry and technology were flat .
Funding for the project was also not possible
But Oort grew impatient .
Fortunately , the Dutch Telecomunikation Service had brought some German radar dishes from the dunes on the More to the radio station in Kootwijk .
It was the so @-@ called Würzburg Bowl , which had been part of the Atlantic Wall .
In 1948 Ir. de Voogt made one of these receivers available for research into the Milky Way system .
We hope this is the right place .
You can &apos;t get anything back from the old radar dish .
It disappeared here in the late 1950s .
But we see the old main building of the radio station and some other buildings .
This shows us that we are in roughly the right place here .
We &apos;re in Hoeven now , with such a huge radar dish .
I &apos;m a bit confused by the color because this white color doesn &apos;t fit .
In fact , all those bowls that formed the Atlantic Wall were protective green .
But what &apos;s left is a real giant telescope , 7.5 metres in diameter , a small staircase , everything ...
Apart from a spice mirror , you also need a good receiver .
But there were no 21 cm receivers at the time .
And the Technical School in Delft had been closed during the war and there were no engineers formed .
Oort found a physics student from Leiden who was trying to build a receiver .
But a year and a half later , he hadn &apos;t got much further . Then , he made a mistake and everything was burned down .
On March 10 , 1950 , one and a half years of work was lost .
Then Oort was looking for a new engineer , from the new generation from the school in Delft :
Lex Muller .
Muller was also a very active radio amateur .
At the end of 1950 he began working for the Dutch Organization for Research on Radiation from the Sun and the Milky Way .
He came to Kootwijk and five months later he managed to detect the 21 cm radio emission from the Milky Way system for the first time :
May 11 , 1951 .
A month and a half earlier , a student from Harvard University in America had
Harold Ewen , it also worked to detect the radiation for the first time .
No wonder because the Americans had a lot of experience with microwave technology since they developed it during the war .
Henk van de Hulst was at Harvard at the time and was responsible for the communication between Harvard , Leiden and Kootwijk .
The results of these first measurements have been published together .
For several weeks Lex Muller made test perceptions and he drew the conclusions that he needed a better receiver for a big survey .
So he took everything from each other and spent a year building a better receiver .
In March 1952 , when the new receiver was almost ready , I went to Kootwijk for a month and a half to calibrate our telescope .
We needed to know exactly in which direction the telescope was pointing .
For this we needed new indicators for azimuth and height , corresponding to the horizontal and vertical movements of the telescope .
Together with a technician from the radio station Kootwijk , we have improved the indicators .
They were not precise and had a wrong zero point .
We also fixed the small discrepancies that still existed to correct for it .
When that was done , the large survey along the Milky Way equator could begin .
After my electronics study I came here in 1954 .
There was a small cottage near the telescope where I worked .
We have mapped the Milky Way .
The perceptions were made day and night by students from Leiden who then came here in Kootwijk .
There were always three students , one for day work , one for evening work and one for night work .
I helped them a bit day and night .
In the telescope there was a clock that had to be set .
To move the telescope there were two handles , one for the azimuth and one for the height .
As the Earth rotates , we had to adjust the position of the telescope every three minutes .
Lists of these positions were prepared in Leiden .
And it was all done by hand .
The first series of measurements had lasted a year , from June 1952 to June 1953 .
Meanwhile Henk van de Hulst received an invitation from Oxford to give the famous Halley reading .
He wanted to show the first plan of the distribution of hydrogen clouds in the Milky Way system .
So we had to put together a first plan before its reading !
To make it possible for Henk van de Hulst to show the first map of the Milky Way system , Oort , the director of Leiden Observatory , organized a crash action .
Every member of staff at the observatory worked on it .
Me too , with my fellow students .
Maarten Schmidt , Gart Westerhout .
We sat in the conference room of the Observatory for a week , I was almost open @-@ minded .
Our task was to process the perceptions from Kootwijk , make calculations about them and give the results to Henk van de Hulst so that he could put together a plan .
Each had a stack of measurements from the same position in the sky .
Each perception was thus a recording of the radio emission Is function of the wavelength or frequency . I have an example here .
The recording starts so trembling , almost zero , as there is no emission .
Then it rises to a maximum , a large radio emission .
Then it falls again a little , and rises to a greater maximum , and then it falls again to zero .
What happened ?
The frequency of the receiver has changed slowly over the course of an hour or two .
This absorbed the hydrogen emission at different frequencies .
Why did they do this ?
I remember the Doppler effect we all know when an ambulance or police car comes by .
Such a car sets a certain tone .
And when he approaches , we hear a higher tone than when he leaves .
The higher the tone , the higher the frequency of the sound wave ( shorter wavelength ) .
And that depends on the speed of the car relative to the observer .
The same principle was applied with the radio receiver in Kootwijk .
He detected the radio waves emitted by hydrogen .
As the hydrogen atoms approach , we perceive a higher frequency , and as they move away a lower frequency .
Higher frequency means shorter wavelength .
Lower frequency means longer wavelength .
So this principle has been used here .
The image shows the intensity of the radio emission at different wavelengths .
This corresponds to a certain number of hydrogen atoms at a safe speed in a direction of the Milky Way system
Our task was to measure the intensities at the different frequencies .
From this , we determined the number of hydrogen atoms and calculated their velocities .
Also many recordings were made at every position in the Milky Way area , because the radio emission is weak and the receiver added a lot of noise .
To reduce the noise , we repeated the recordings several times .
We then had three , five or ten recordings and had to determine the mean so that the signal would be stronger and the noise weaker .
And we gave the result to Henk van de Hulst .
From this , he determined where the hydrogen atoms lay at different speeds in the Milky Way system .
You can see that the hydrogen clouds are in a spiral band around the galactic center .
Here is the sun , here is the galactic center and the hydrogen clouds are lying around in one arm .
Very similar to what is known from extragalactic spiral nebulae .
This was a first indication that the Milky Way system has spiral arms of hydrogen gas .
Something you didn &apos;t know before .
This was the big surprise Van de Hulst announced in his Oxford lecture :
a spiral structure of the Milky Way system had been discovered , based on perceptions from Kootwijk .
After the Oxford reading , a second survey was started in November 1953 .
Here we saw not only the Milky Way equator , but also 10 degrees above and 10 degrees below , at hundreds of positions .
We measured the radio emission as a function of velocity and detuned the distribution of hydrogen gas in the Milky Way system , also above and below the Milky Way equator .
In this way , we compiled a 3 @-@ dimensional map of the Milky Way system .
And so we mapped the Milky Way system , i.e. , the part you can see from the Netherlands ! Because you can not see the whole Michstrasse .
This resulted in this beautiful colored plan .
He was so beautiful that he hung several months on a wall in the observatory . He also went to various conferences .
You see here four spiral arms .
We already knew the one out of arm from the first survey , and these dark regions here in the inner part of the Milky Way system .
But , as you can see , there is something missing here .
That is the part you cannot see from the Netherlands .
There were fellow astronomers from Sydney , Australia , who had also begun to make radio observations .
The leader of this group , Frank Kerr , came to Leiden to work together .
He treated his data in a similar way to what we had done for our surveys .
And this plan shows the combination of the Dutch and the Australian results .
You see a difference between the parts .
You notice that the Dutch part looks sharper than the Australian part . That &apos;s because the Australians used a slightly different method .
But the spiral arms of the two parts connect well !
The important point of this diagram is that one can clearly see how the hydrogen gas in the Milky Way system is distributed in spiral arms .
Just as this publication says in its title :
&apos;The Galactic System as a Spiral Nebula &apos; is a spiral nebula .
Comparable to the spiral nebulae we have known from photos like this one for a long time .
So that was the big result of the survey from Kootwijk , in collaboration with our colleagues from Sydney .
Our situation has now been clearly demonstrated :
a planet around a normal star , somewhere on the edge of an ordinary Milky Way system of stars , gas and dust with spiral arms .
And there are millions and millions of them .
Dutch astronomy had made a great and valuable contribution to this insight .
The Netherlands still plays an important role in an area where new discoveries are still being made , new instruments are being developed and the limits of our skills and knowledge are being pushed ever further .

Don &apos;t think we &apos;re done now !
What has happened in these hundred years , count on it , in the next hundred years it will be the same .
And now we have no idea where this is going !
We should prepare ourselves for perspectives that we cannot imagine at this stage .
You &apos;re never finished .

THE KISS OF DEATH Crime drama in three acts
The case of Dr. Monro , who died on April 1 in mysterious circumstances , is being investigated .
The first witness : Anna Harper , housekeeper of the dead man .
&quot; When I laid the breakfast table ... &quot;
... &quot; the doctor &apos;s daughter shouted that something bad had happened . &quot;
&quot; In the hall lay the Doctor , dead . &quot;
&apos;A man I &apos;d never seen told me not to touch anything and to open it to the police . &apos;
&apos;Based on what he said , the servant was arrested , &apos; he said .
The testimony of the second witness .
Mr. Weyler , chief engineer of United Mechanics , states :
If the drafts are not available on 1 April , we will lose millions and you will lose your position ...
&apos;I &apos;d been tired and unable to work for weeks . &apos;
&quot; I was treated by my GP Dr Monro ... &quot;
&quot; Although I took his medicine , I became increasingly weak . &quot;
&apos;My boss was angry because I didn &apos;t move forward . &apos;
&quot; The deadline for the drafts is 1 April ! &quot;
Your work is much more important to you than our marriage !
I will leave you and return to my parents .
You will never see me again !
&quot; An engineer named Lebel visited me to show me an invention . &quot;
&quot; I made a startling discovery ... &quot;
&apos;We &apos;re similar !
Show me your profile ! &quot;
&quot; I had a crazy idea . &quot;
&quot; If I don &apos;t finish , I lose my position . Carry on for me , you &apos;ll make it in time ! &quot;
&quot; At first he thought my idea was absurd ... &quot;
&quot; But then we changed clothes ... &quot;
&apos;We did a test to clear up any lingering doubts , &apos; he said .
&apos;And since my wife had left me , he said yes , &apos; he said .
&quot; I retreated to a sanatorium . &quot;
End of Act I
Act Two
The testimony of the third witness .
As a third witness , engineer Lebel testified that Dr. Monro was not thrilled to find him healthy .
In order not to betray himself , he also took the prescribed medicine and fell ill .
Another doctor , Dr Adell , examined him and discovered that the medicine contained poison .
After quitting medicine , he was able to work again .
Weyler &apos;s wife didn &apos;t notice either .
The designs were finished on March 30 , he said , but they were stolen the same night .
He could remember a dark figure in the room .
&quot; The next morning ... &quot;
&quot; I was shocked to see that the most important drawing was missing . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Adell wanted to help me clarify the incident . &quot;
&quot; In the evening we made our preparations . &quot;
&quot; Again I saw the mysterious man ... &quot;
&quot; He felt my pulse and said :
Odd that , isn &apos;t it ? &apos;
&quot; Then he tried to open the safe . &quot;
&quot; Dazed by the gas , I was still able to follow him . &quot;
&quot; No trace of the burglar , just a man , lonely at night . &quot;
&quot; The man was Dr. Monro . &quot;
&apos;We found the burglar &apos;s mask and cape in the garden . &apos;
&quot; Dr. Monro wanted to examine the mask at home . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to be there and I followed him . &quot;
&quot; I asked Dr Adell to wait for me at home . &quot;
End of Act II
Act Three
&quot; I accompanied Dr. Monro home . &quot;
&quot; The door was locked from the outside . &quot;
&quot; The other door was also locked .
I heard footsteps , the key was moving ... &quot;
&apos;Monro &apos;s daughter came in and asked about her father . &apos;
&quot; When the girl was in bed and I went into the hall , I suddenly heard voices ... &quot;
Lebel understands : The competitor of United Mechanics is behind the attack on Weyler . He , too , is now in danger .
In order not to betray himself , he stays with Monro overnight .
Hot chocolate is served in the morning . Lebel does not touch it .
Monro &apos;s daughter comes in .
She knocks on the tray and munches on cocoa .
Dr. Monro takes her in his arms and gives her a kiss .
A kiss of death ! A few seconds later he is dead .
&quot; Dr. Adell found a deadly poison in the sugar bowl . &quot;
&quot; I took the stolen drawings to Weyler &apos;s company and &quot; my wife &quot; returned and threw herself into my arms . &quot;
&quot; But here came her husband ! &quot;

Selma Lagerlöf : Herr Arnes Schatz . A winter ballad in 5 acts .
Once upon a time , when King John III ruled over Sweden , there was such a severe winter over the country as there had not been in living memory .
The king had uncovered a conspiracy among his Scottish mercenaries .
They were banished from the empire and placed under guard until they had crossed the border .
Their leaders , bold and intrepid men , were imprisoned in a tower .
... and the youngest of them , Sir Archie .
As long as they were on the territory of the Swedish king , they did not dare to make themselves known .
They procured leather combs and pretended to be journeymen tanners who went across the country looking for work .
... and when they reached the border , they were starving .
At that time there lived in Marstrand a poor fishmonger named Torarin .
He wandered around a lot , selling salted and dried fish .
&apos;I &apos;ve heard some big news today , Grim .
The sea is frozen &quot; &quot; not only the bay and the sound , but far out . &quot;
&quot; When we pass the presbytery of Solberga , Grim , &quot; we can ask there , &quot; if the ice carries all the way to Marstrand . &quot;
The dog mostly lay still and listened silently to his master .
But when he heard something that did not please him , he stood up , held his muzzle in the wind , and howled - as if he were a wolf .
&quot; What do you have against Solberga , my dear ? &quot;
&apos;We &apos;ve both gone to the rectory a lot to visit Mr Arne . &apos;
In the parish house in Solberga the priest , - - Mr. Arne , sat with his family and the servants at the meal .
The priest was old and white @-@ haired , but still a strong and strong man .
But the years had been hard on his wife .
At Mr. Arne &apos;s other side sat the auxiliary pastor .
At the end of the table sat Mr. Arne &apos;s granddaughter , Berghild , and Elsalill , her foster sister , an orphan raised in the rectory .
Torarin was the only stranger there he could not turn his gaze away from the great oak stillness that stood at the foot of the canopy bed .
As poor as Torarin was , he did not want to possess this money , for he had heard that Mr. Arne had taken it from the great monasteries that had formerly existed in the country , and that the old monks had prophesied that this money would bring him misfortune .
&quot; Why are they sharpening knives in Branehög ? &quot;
&quot; But tell me , why are they sharpening their long knives in Branehög tonight ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you hear them scratching and scratching ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you hear the crunching and creaking ? &quot;
&quot; How can you hear them sharpening knives in Branehög ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s more than a mile from here . &quot;
&quot; Pick up your spoon again and let us finish the meal . &quot;
On the same evening there was a cheerful party in the inn of Branehög ... and all villagers were invited
&quot; It is true , as they say , that those who have the shortest way always come last . &quot;
&apos;I can still see them standing there sharpening their knives , &apos; he said .
&quot; God knows what they have in mind . &quot;
&quot; It will probably be nothing more than that the vicar &apos;s wife heard three journeymen tanners &quot; putting their tools in order . &quot;
Long after midnight , a few men went out and harnessed their horses to drive home .
Get up !
Stand up !
The parsonage of Solberga is on fire !
&quot; Mr. Arne and his family were murdered that night by three men in leather jackets &quot; who had climbed over the roof . &quot;
&quot; Mr Arne &apos;s horse was stolen from the stable &quot; and his sleigh stolen from the shed . &quot;
The poor orphan girl was the only one to escape the bloodbath . Torarin took her with him and his old mother to his poor hut .
Torarin &apos;s hut was located high up on the highest point of the island and all those who were trapped by the frost in Marstrand climbed over and over again past the hut onto the rocks to see if the frozen bay and the sound their icecaps .
Often Elsalill would stand there and watch them go up there .
She thought how lucky they were all because they had something to yearn for .
You yourself asked for nothing more in the world .
&quot; I am not so rich , Elsalill , that I can give you food and clothing , &quot; &quot; that you may put your hands in your lap and ponder your cares . &quot;
&quot; Oh , Mother Katri , the last one they killed was my foster sister . &quot;
&quot; She begged for her life , &quot; one of them stabbed her in the heart . &quot;
&quot; If I hadn &apos;t been hiding behind the stove , &quot; she said , &quot; I would be with my lovely foster sister now . &quot;
&quot; I wish they were still alive so that I could tear their hearts out of their chests , I wish they were still alive , &quot; &quot; so that I could see how to divide them into four and tie them to the wheel . &quot;
&quot; We have not come to frighten you , Virgin . &quot; &quot; We only ask you to let us hear your story . &quot;
&quot; We came to Marstrand because we want to cross to Scotland , &quot; &quot; but the sound is frozen over .
That is why we must pass the time here , &quot; &quot; and we would be very happy , Virgin , &quot; &quot; if you let us hear your story . &quot;
&quot; Show them calmly that you are not too small to talk to a gentleman , Elsalill . &quot;
&quot; You are a virgin of good origin , not a fisherman &apos;s girl . &quot;
Since that day Sir Archie often came to Torarin &apos;s hut to talk to Elsalill ...
&quot; God himself has sent you to me , Elsalill ! &quot;
&quot; Elsalill , do you want to come to Scotland with me - as my wife ? &quot;
&quot; There I will build a castle for you &quot; &quot; and make you a noble lady . &quot;
&quot; Do you see the hair in my hand , Elsalill ? &quot;
&quot; Do you see the blonde curls ? &quot;
&quot; Likewise , my foster sister &apos;s hair wound around the hand of the one who killed her . &quot; &quot;
&quot; We were afraid for no reason , Elsalill .
You see , it was nothing &quot; &quot; just a ray of sunshine falling through the window . &quot;
&quot; Sir Archie , why did you remind me of the dead ? &quot;
&quot; Let me , let me , Sir Archie , &quot; &quot; for now I have only the dead in mind . &quot;
&quot; Grim , my dog , now you can no longer doubt that we are crossing the sea . &quot;
You see , there &apos;s a big ship frozen in the ice . &apos;
&quot; What do you think when we greet the captain , Grim , and hear &quot; &quot; if he wants to buy fish ? &quot;
Should the ice never break , should it never be possible to cross to Scotland ?
Sir Archie wanted to question the captain about it .
&quot; You who come around everywhere and hear what is happening , you know , &quot; Why has God blocked the way to the sea for so long this year and is holding us all prisoner ? &quot;
&quot; I once lay in the harbour of Bergen for a full month , &quot; &quot; and every day such a strong wind blew , &quot; &quot; that no ship could sail ... &quot;
But on board one of the ships that lay trapped in the harbour , &quot; there was a church robber , and he would have escaped if the storm had not raged ... &quot;
... &quot; And as soon as they brought him ashore , &quot; the weather cleared up and we had a good wind ... &quot;
&quot; Do you now understand what I mean by asking if you know &quot; why God keeps the gates of the sea closed ? &quot;
&quot; He wanted to sail to Scotland for himself and his men , &quot; &quot; but I don &apos;t think of sailing with such lawless fellows on board ... &quot;
Some time later Elsalill had a strange dream she saw her dead foster sister standing in front of her ...
Elsalill saw that they were in a room in the council cellar , where the waitress was washing dishes and jugs , and she felt as if her foster sister were asking her to help her do the dishes .
The next day , the dream was still very much in her mind and she was irresistibly drawn to the places where her foster sister had guided her in her dream .
&quot; Instead of just standing around here , you can come in and help me wash the jugs and plates . &quot;
&quot; Drink , my brother !
We still have Mr. Arnes treasure ! &quot;
She could not betray him .
She had become too fond of him .
She could not send him to the torture bench and on the bike .
She could not watch them burn his hands and feet .
&quot; God bless you for coming to me tonight , Elsalill ! &quot;
&quot; Elsalill , I did not come to you for a few days , &quot; &quot; because I was tormented by heavy thoughts . &quot;
&quot; But when I found you out here , my heart told me - &quot; - &quot; what I must do to be freed from my torment forever . &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m crying , Sir Archie , because in my heart I feel too much love for you . &apos;
&quot; Soon the sea will be open and the ships will be able to sail to my homeland . &quot;
&quot; Elsalill , do you want to follow me there ? &quot;
&quot; You must come with me , Elsalill , otherwise it will be my downfall . &quot;
&quot; I will come to you tonight , Elsalill . &quot;
&apos;I &apos;ve got to have an answer from you today . &apos;
&quot; Why are you standing here in the street crying ? &quot;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you stay in the council cellar ? &quot;
&quot; I left so that I did not have to listen to the speeches of the criminals sitting there in the hall . &quot;
&quot; And yet I heard three men talking , and one said , &quot; Drink , my brother ! We still have Mr. Arne &apos;s treasure ! &quot;
&apos;If you &apos;ve heard those words there , Virgin , don &apos;t run away now . &apos;
&quot; You must go with me to those who have the power and the will to seize the murderers and bring them to their punishment . &quot;
The captain sent a message telling Sir Archie and his men to bring their luggage on board .
In the west , the ice had begun to break up , and it might well be that they would find an open way over to Scotland before dawn .
&quot; Go to the hostel and put everything in order . &quot;
&apos;I &apos;ve still got a lot to discuss with Elsalill . &apos;
&quot; Sir Reginald and Sir Philip went to the inn , &quot; &quot; Sir Archie said .
&quot; Flee , Sir Archie , the City Guard is after you . &quot;
&apos;They &apos;re coming because they &apos;re looking for Mr Arne &apos;s killers . &apos;
&quot; Was it you , Elsalill , who recognized me and betrayed me ? &quot;
&quot; They come to seize you . Flee ! &quot;
&quot; Do you not realize that this is the end of all my hope of ever atoning for my iniquity ? &quot;
&apos;But why did you do it , Sir Archie ? &apos;
&quot; We were mad with hunger and cold &quot; and intoxicated by the brandy we had drunk . &quot;
&apos;I didn &apos;t know what I was doing . &apos;
&quot; Why did you let me down at the very moment I believed in you the most ? &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t have to worry about me , Elsalill , tonight , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m me again .
I &apos;m back in my old frame of mind ... &apos;
... &quot; and tonight , nothing bad will happen to me , &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll see . &quot;
... and holding Elsalill like a shield , Sir Archie leapt towards the exit .
She loved a werewolf , she protected a wretched murderer with her body .
And with the next step Sir Archie took , the spear penetrated deep into Elsalill &apos;s heart .
All night long the captain of the big ship ran restlessly up and down the aft deck ...
It is hard to know why the captain was out on such a blustery night .
His entire crew was on board , as were the fellow passengers he was supposed to bring over to Scotland .
Only when a grey morning dawned did the captain see what he had been waiting for so long .
The bay and the sound were open far out to sea .
But where her ship was frozen , there was not even the slightest crack in the ice .
&quot; I came to fetch the maiden , &quot; &quot; which the Scots brought to the ship yesterday ... &quot;
&quot; Last night she was dragged away by Mr. Arne &apos;s killers , &quot; &quot; and they brought her here on the ship ... &quot;
&apos;No , the City watchdog doesn &apos;t dare come out . &apos;
&quot; They say there are a hundred mercenaries on board &quot; and they don &apos;t want to mess with them ... &quot;
&quot; I now know why we are trapped here , &quot; &quot; while the other ships have already gone out to sea : &quot;
&quot; Obey and obey the word of this man .
He is only doing God &apos;s will ! &quot;
And after the killers were brought ashore , the storm began to rage again .
And from the high aft deck , the captain saw a long line of people streaming out to the ship .
There were all the women of Marstrand , young and old , in mourning clothes .
And with them came boys carrying a stretcher .
They had come to take the virgin who loved a criminal , and who had given her life to destroy him whom she loved .
... and as the women returned to the city , the storm and the waves behind them whirled the ice aside .
And when they arrived in Marstrand with Elsalill , the gates of the sea were wide open .

A film with a smile and perhaps a tear .

THE GUIDE OF DEATH
Director : VICTOR SJÖSTRÖM Camera :
J. JULIUS JAENZON
Once upon a time there was a poor Salvation Army Sister . She was dying .
She had been severely dizzy for a year .
When there was no hope , she went to her mother .
With her was a comrade from the Salvation Army .
&apos;Don &apos;t think of the poor , sister !
They &apos;ve done enough for her . &apos;
&quot; Get David Holm ! &quot;
&quot; My daughter belonged to you until the very end .
Let her die with me now ! &quot;
&apos;Don &apos;t you hear , Mary ?
Get David Holm ! &quot;
&quot; Get him now ! &quot;
Impossible !
You can &apos;t leave David Holm to die ! &apos;
&apos;I couldn &apos;t find him anywhere .
Gustafsson &apos;s going to bring him here . &apos;
&quot; Poor Ms Holm ! &quot;
&quot; I will accompany you home .
Don &apos;t let your husband see you here . &apos;
This evening was no ordinary evening .
It was New Year &apos;s Eve .
&quot; We are toasting New Year &apos;s Eve here at the right time ! &quot;
&apos;It &apos;s scary to be here celebrating New Year &apos;s Eve with the dead . &apos;
&quot; Are the gentlemen afraid of ghosts ? &quot;
&quot; Until midnight , I &apos;ll tell you a New Year &apos;s Eve story . &quot;
&quot; I had a good friend called Georges , who was always in a good mood . &quot;
&quot; He came from a good family and had studied in Uppsala . &quot;
&apos;But on New Year &apos;s Eve he was suddenly changed . &apos;
&quot; Remember ! It is New Year &apos;s Eve , the last day of the year ! &quot;
&apos;Whoever dies today will have to drive the funeral carriage for a year , &apos; he said .
&quot; There &apos;s an old car ... &quot;
&quot; Him no ordinary carter guides , and he serves a stern master , death . &quot;
&quot; One hundred years on earth is only one day for him .
He is at the service of His Lord day and night . &quot;
End of Part 1 Part 2
&apos;Wherever he goes , he &apos;s met with pain and suffering . &apos;
&apos;He &apos;s never going to get away from his hard work . &apos;
&apos;It &apos;s not always the same driver driving the car . &apos;
&quot; The last person to die at midnight on New Year &apos;s Eve will be the driver for the following year . &quot;
&apos;That &apos;s why I &apos;m afraid something will happen to me on New Year &apos;s Eve . &apos;
&apos;The strange thing is , Georges died on the same New Year &apos;s Eve . &apos;
&quot; Why doesn &apos;t Gustafsson come with David Holm ? &quot;
&quot; Come along , David Holm !
Sister Edit is dying . She wants to see you ! &quot;
&quot; Hurry up when Sister Edit calls you ! &quot;
&quot; Oh David , that it is you who redeem me ! &quot;
&quot; You better take me to the hospital immediately ! &quot;
&apos;There &apos;s no living person driving this car .
When I come , any help is too late . &quot;
&quot; You know that it is a dead man who speaks to you . &quot;
&apos;And you &apos;re going to have to pay for the consequences of your actions . &apos;
&apos;I know it &apos;s my fault that you ended up like that . &apos;
&quot; Without me , you would have led an honorable life with your family . &quot;
&quot; Tomorrow you are free .
But before that , an even harsher punishment hits you ! &quot;
&quot; Your brother murdered in a frenzy and must go to prison ! &quot;
&quot; Actually you should go to prison instead of your brother , because you made him a murderer ! &quot;
&quot; Doesn &apos;t that take you off your path ? &quot;
&apos;Now I know what it &apos;s like to bring so much misery on someone you love ! &apos;
&quot; And your wife and children ? &quot;
&apos;I know how hard they &apos;ve had it .
But now I &apos;m starting a new life ! &apos;

<unk> wasn &apos;t ill at all when she left here . &apos;
&quot; I thought I could come home full of joy ! &quot;
&quot; Without warning she let me into an empty house !
It was heartless ! &quot;
&apos;You &apos;re going to miss the laughter !
I &apos;ll show her what it &apos;s like when your heart freezes ! &apos;
&quot; You searched for your wife all over the country , and your hatred and thirst for revenge grew immeasurably . &quot;
&quot; A year ago on New Year &apos;s Eve , you came to this city - and the misfortune with you . &quot;
&quot; That was the day the Salvation Army opened its new base . &quot;
&apos;No , I don &apos;t want food , I just want to sleep . &apos;
&quot; Leave the jacket !
We don &apos;t know how contagious it is . &apos;
&quot; How gladly I help the first guest whom God has sent here ! &quot;
&apos;Go to sleep .
I &apos;ll do the rest . &apos;
&quot; Jesus Christ , give our guest a Happy New Year ! &quot;
She sat over her jacket all night without thinking of contagion .
When she went to bed , the room was completely chilled .
&quot; Did you sew my jacket ? &quot;
&quot; Get the person who did it ! &quot;
&apos;The girl tried in vain , I &apos;m used to it . &apos;
&quot; Please come back next New Year &apos;s Eve ! &quot;
&quot; I want to know if Jesus Christ answered my New Year prayer for you . &quot;
&apos;Yes , I &apos;m coming back to show that the talk didn &apos;t go to plan . &apos;
&apos;Now keep your promise and go to Sister Edit before you take over my office , &apos; he said .
&quot; The most beautiful thing you have had - and lost .
You can &apos;t escape your guilty conscience or my office . &apos;
&quot; Trapped soul , come out of your prison ! &quot;
&quot; Your soul is set free at midnight .
Now you have to get the souls off the earth ! &quot;

&quot; Death ! It comes too soon . &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m not scared .
But I &apos;ve got to talk to someone before I leave . &apos;

I can &apos;t stand before God like that . &apos;
&quot; The man I want to talk to is the man I love ! &quot;

She &apos;s constantly worried about him and his wife . &apos;
&apos;Leave the kids alone so they don &apos;t get infected . &apos;
&quot; This time you couldn &apos;t run away ! &quot;
&quot; When will you stop taking revenge , David ? &quot;
&apos;If only I hadn &apos;t brought them back together !
Then his guilt would not be so great ! &quot;
&apos;I can &apos;t die yet !
I &apos;ve just got to see how he &apos;s changed ! &apos;

&apos;David , I &apos;d like to give people a New Year &apos;s message . &apos;
&quot; Let them remember this message :
&apos;God , let my soul ripen before the harvest ! &apos;
&quot; Why are we here ?
&apos;I can &apos;t stand it any longer ! &apos;
&quot; It is a sin , but I cannot leave you behind . &quot;
&apos;Don &apos;t be angry with me .
It &apos;s not my fault . &apos;
&quot; You &apos;ll see that it &apos;s enough for the three of us , David ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , I see it .
It &apos;s my duty to watch . &apos;
&quot; The poor creatures must not die !
Don &apos;t do that to me ! &apos;
&quot; I have no power over the living . &quot;
&quot; Shall I pray to God or to Jesus ?
Who has the power ? Where should I turn ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , I poor sinner !
I pray to you , Lord of life and death !
I have violated your commandments . &quot;
&quot; Do with me what you want .
But spare my wife and the children ! &quot;
&apos;Now I don &apos;t have to worry about you anymore . &apos;
I arrived just in time ! &quot;
I promised her I &apos;d be good to you . &apos;
Mary said you didn &apos;t come ! &apos;
&apos;No one believes me that I &apos;m going to get better .
How can I not cry ? &quot;
&quot; If you cry , David , I believe you . &quot;
&apos;It &apos;s only when I &apos;ve cried all the grief out that I &apos;m happy . &apos;
&quot; God , let my soul ripen before the harvest ! &quot;

Fighting Hearts ( The Four for the Woman )
During a break of the stockbrokers .
That &apos;s the broker Yquem .
He has the most beautiful wife you can imagine .
Shall I call my Lord and announce to him that gracious woman ...
No !
I want to surprise him !
Good job , isn &apos;t it ?

A successful imitation !
For today you can close !
Hey !
What do you want here ?
If only you had a few marks for me !
I am desperately in need !
Werner Krafft ?
Hmm ...
Do you know a certain William Krafft ?
William Krafft is my brother &apos;s name !
He used to live in the City Hotel ...
I haven &apos;t seen him in five years ...
I had to leave Europe because ...
I will be very happy to support William Krafft &apos;s brother .
The Brilliant Exchange .
For Florence .
You know what , Krafft ?
Her brother Werner was here .
I lent him money , William , because ... because I thought ...
I desperately need a ring that looks exactly like this one tonight !
His name is Krafft .

Mr. Yquem shut down the bureau a little earlier today , most graciously .
No , Madame , the merciful Lord is not yet back .
It is a woman named Florence Forster .
She disappeared four years ago .
Nothing is known about her whereabouts .

How sad is the day that I will pass it away from you !
Margot , a friend of Florence .
Tonight may I be served a &quot; souper à deux &quot; ...
Turtle soup ?
Baked oysters ?
No .
Pâté de foie gras en croûte .
With white port wine vintage 1864 , then roast beef with Coeur d &apos;artichauts , mushrooms , sauce rémoulade .
Furthermore , a rather fiery Chambertin vintage 1911 ...
I don &apos;t want dessert , but cheese ... baked . Heidsieck &quot; goût américain . &quot;
Mr Krafft has just left .
Anyway , I need a room ..
It is our custom that guests without luggage pay for their room in advance .
That &apos;s what old Upton sends you .
In the meantime , you can wait here for Mr Krafft .
How well you do , mon petit .
But what &apos;s the point of all this if your husband is constantly travelling ?
However , a beautiful woman does not necessarily have to be faithful to her husband !
Mr Krafft left the hotel about an hour ago , but by 10am he had ordered dinner for two .
I love my husband more than anything , Margot .
But before you got married , didn &apos;t you love another man ?
There was a lot of talk about it at the time , but no one knew exactly who that person was .
Back then , I didn &apos;t love my husband the way I love him now .
My heart belonged to someone else .
And when my father appointed Harry as my husband against my will ...
I must speak to Miss Florence again at all costs !
There is no point in telling you the name of my future husband !
It would be futile to fight against my father &apos;s will .
Let &apos;s go upstairs and see if Florence has recovered from her migraine .
She &apos;s not alone !
And then ?
And then ?
But now you have aroused my curiosity with your story , and I am curious to hear what happened next !
Is Mr Yquem at home ?
Then please let me know to his wife .
That is very interesting , very interesting indeed !
And your husband never found out what actually happened ?
I don &apos;t understand you , Florence !
Why did you reject this visitor ? I am not like this :
Only yesterday I met a gentleman in the City Hotel , and today ...
And your husband , Margot ?
My husband ... my husband takes care of his business ... like yours !
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
You look like a hunter lying in wait ...
You &apos;re right , and there &apos;s the game I &apos;m waiting for .
Let me tell you : on the evening of my engagement to Florence , something mysterious happened ...
Florence had withdrawn on the grounds that she was suffering from a migraine ; her father and I , worried about her condition , climbed up to her room .
Tell me the truth , Florence :
Do you love this man ?
I can &apos;t imagine Florence cheated on me , but the memory of that evening won &apos;t go out of my mind !
Drive to Tiergartenstr . 245 , Villa Yquem .
You won &apos;t get it back until you pick it up with your own lips !
It is written in the Bible : Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth .
I have to find out the whole truth , whatever the cost !
But I must finally be certain !
Bring me a neutral envelope !
I do not have a red light and I would ask you to give me a small amount .
I don &apos;t remember dating another one !
Then at least allow me to wait here for my brother !
Trust me , he will atone for this , the villain !
I need a power shower in five minutes .
I am pleased to see , my dearest , that you feel quite comfortable even without my company .
I will therefore no longer stand in the way of your pleasure ...
How long does it take to drive from here to Tiergartenstr . 245 ?
You are making a great mistake , Mr Yquem , when you neglect your wife so much !
Consul , master is not coming .
Once again we have to be alone !
Once and for all : The gracious Lady does not wish to receive you .
That should be enough to change their minds !
Let him in .
Do what you think is right .
You have your destiny in your own hands !
You can reveal to the world whatever you want , but you will never make me break the fidelity I have sworn to my husband !
I apologise , but your extraordinary resemblance to an old friend ...
Then this letter was also addressed to my brother Werner !
This is indeed my writing , but I have never written such a letter !
Do you know anything about what happened to your brother ?
Please , my lady , spare me any questions about my brother .
He will have perished in one of the countries where he went about his business !
I know where Yquem lives ;
He has a very beautiful wife .
A Mr. Krafft is visiting the gracious woman .
Pack the suitcases of the merciful .
She will leave the house this evening .
You are in error , Mr Yquem .
Locked up !
My poor friend !
I knew of all this and have come to raise you up in this hour of destiny !
So are all women !
Forget them forever !
No , I will never forget Florence !
I have come , my Lord , to warn them .
Your wife is in great danger !
Florence ?

Florence is here ?
Your wife does not wish reconciliation with the offender of her honour , and will leave this House under my protection !
Indeed , Commissioner .
No sooner had I noticed the change of ring than I rushed here to file a complaint .
But ... I think there is only one person who can have made the mistake , and that is Mr Krafft .
Mr. Krafft recently drove his car to Tiergartenstr . 245 .
No officers in uniform !
All in plain clothes !
This is my brother , but he never told me anything about this matter !
Forgive me , Florence .
All my life and all my work is yours !
My only thought is you !
Florence , I know well that it is neither worthy of me nor of you to ask you such a question , but have pity on me poor fool :
What happened on the day of our engagement ?
I do not want even the shadow of suspicion to rest upon you !
I will take all the blame !
So here you go , boy ?
t you want to say good evening to an old friend like me ?
We have caught the thief , but who is the murderer of the dead man who is out there ?
He is innocent !
He killed him to protect my honor !
This ruby belongs to the jewel collection stolen from the Duke of Axminster .
How did it come into your possession ?
On what day was the theft committed ?
If so , I can prove my husband &apos;s innocence .
I can teach him an alibi , using my diary , which I keep in the conservatory .
Werner !
Praise be to God who has brought you here !
Now you can testify that I told my husband the truth !
My guilty conscience crushes me !
If you were to leave me , I would not deserve anything better !
I love you , Harry , and will wait faithfully for you until your guilt is atoned for , just as I have been faithful to you until now !

Goodbye , sheep farmer !
God bless you , welcome and rest .
I swear they &apos;re a bloke , buxom like Jánošík .
Like .
What &apos;s the point ?
Like who ?
I swear ! Like Jánošík , who lived here before ... !
He harnessed little what awaits him at home when , after two years of torment and learning , he came home to visit his parents .
Not enough bread ! Too much work !
Praised be ... !
The long journey has exhausted me .
Would they give me some water .
For good .
Cheers .
A this is our neighbour Anka .
Yes - Anièka !
Pišta . The gentleman of the shop .
It was two years ago !
Not so fast - the kiss still burns - the mustache was burned .
Don &apos;t go yet .
Oho !
Just through the cloth .
Familiar excuses .
The friend and protector of Jánošík .
I haven &apos;t seen my father or my mother yet , how are they doing ?
Are they healthy ?
Dear Father , where is Mother ?
Face Mother , Mother !
Old Jánošík was out of work again !
My wife is dead !
She wasn &apos;t jumping out of the chest when you were in the front row .
Fifty floors !
Get Jánošík , they beat his father !
Do they have a certain , they , they ... !
Good that the monk is here , they save for the funeral !
- And they have beaten him so that he died that day .
In the village .
Into bondage !
Into bondage !
Think about it , listen to me and you will never have to go into slavery again !
Chased by the henchman , Jánošík hid in a cave .
My mother , my mother , behind two mountains , my head hurts when I cry for her .
Praised .
Thank you , Anka !
Never !
Go !
I thought there was no one here who was going to take care of my parents &apos; graves .
But you -
Anka , you angel .
No Anka , I &apos;m not going to be a pastor .
Cursed Reign hinders my path .
Now you will not escape me !
We will catch him and get the reward of one hundred ducats .
The uncalled witness .
I swear they get it wrong sometimes sir .
I am not a priest yet and I will never be one .
This dog and Šándor robbed me of everything and cast me out like an animal !
Is it you , Jánošík of Terchová
Are you really ?

I am Hrajnoha , the captain of the Forest Brotherhood .
And we almost forgot that

Yes , there is a way up by the grove , down by the grove , up by the grove ; my father is good , and I am a robber .
Guys !

- Jánošík - new friend , become our captain .
Long live Janosík !
Long live the new captain !
I was supposed to be a pastor but the devil changed my plans .
Do they want me to be their new captain ?
Well , I suppose .
I promise to be your righteous guide !
And as before , I will protect my subjects .
I &apos;m going to help him , with money or otherwise .
Our Will - Our Power .
That all our work serves the well @-@ being of the people .
Servants take everything from us - property , freedom , life - we will not spare them !
But we will not murder , do not forget !
Death does not change anyone .
Long live Janosík !
Long live the new captain !
The walls of Count Šándor preserve the silent witnesses of the nobleman &apos;s exuberant life .
There are many varieties of noblemen .
The Hungarian is a nobleman .
In the neighbouring dominion .
You go on a visit .

Mr Baron Révay .
What a surprise .
His nobility , will they pay your debt ?
Oh yeah !
Yes , I have just paid my bills .
How many more times do I have to remind them of the 5000 golds ?
Ch will expose them .
That &apos;s what they got from the elders ?
That &apos;s a wine !
Now they &apos;re going to sell me kegs ?
How to sell ?
I will give it to them .
But , you don &apos;t have to make such an effort , I &apos;ll buy it .
Believe me , on the honor of the nobleman , if the harvest were in the barn , I would immediately pay back , but so , where to take ?
And the peasants ?
Could they repay their debt ?
How should I understand it ?
How ? Very simple !
Every farmer should pay 50 pennies , if he does not have , he should give goods !
The Jew buys it , and they have money in their hands .
So my brother , they order the coachman not to string the horses , I stay until tomorrow .
It is announced that your Lord Count Šándor commands his subjects to give 50 pennies each today !
If you don &apos;t have the money , you should pay the tax in full .
Whoever resists shall be stamped and thrown into the dungeon !
Give me the pots back !
You have to hand over the tax and I have nothing .
Dan couldn &apos;t pay her for the work .
And what the hell am I going to do about it ?
In a moment .
But that &apos;s cheap .
Numbers ?
I come for the tax myself in the afternoon .
Her advice has been brilliant .
And we &apos;re quits .
Follow my advice next time , too .
Friends ! I have to go to the village .
And you Hrajnoha , take Baron Révay before you !
For the subjects there is no rest even on Sunday .
Van the Gentleman will keep his word .
The daughter has no one here , right ?
Thou shalt no longer labour in this booth , I came for thee , thou shalt come with me to the castle .
Do be smart , you &apos;ll be better off in the castle .
O thou shy narrower , be not defiant , and forget this robber quickly .
And this robber is here !
So here &apos;s the nest of the predators , what ?
But you will not escape us !
You coward !
So you will feel this coward !
Under the umbrella of the paternal protector .
Father , help me , save Anka from Šándor .
Son on what path are you .
O Father , they do not judge me , they understand my poor soul , the tormented people !
Oh dear !
Become the father of my Anka !
Jánošík took care of the poor subjects , he helped them through the Terchová pastor and other secret friends .
In the evening at the parish .
What was taken by Šándor &apos;s henchmen cannot be returned .
But here Jánošík will send you a pair of ducats .
The conference with the Lord .
Now the Hungarian master is not the master of his peasants ?
Should he tolerate the robbers telling us what to do and what not to do ?
Well , and do you know what happened on the last Graffs Ball ?
Before midnight ... when the pleasure was at its peak ...
They take the subject , I take you .
And every sin is punished !
You beat my father to death !
You robbed him of everything !
Remember you do not unleash my vengeance !
Well , we should tolerate that !
That &apos;s not order !
I assure them my masters that I will purge them of the robber .
Here , Mr Kommisaar ... I will provide them with the army .
The trap is set .
And the mistress is hiding in the parish ?
Where did the beloved hide ?
And you stupid old man you give the robbers money to the peasants , what ?
The Lord will drive you from the parish !
I &apos;ve reconciled myself with everything .
Well , old man , don &apos;t you have wine for the guest ?
Yes , Granny !
No robber fell in love with you , what ?
What brought them here , how shall I serve them ?
I came for confession .
But now you will confess to me !
Does the robber come here often ?
He doesn &apos;t come .
Why don &apos;t you get the girl ?


So that she can tell us where the robber is !
I don &apos;t know !
You too know where he is !
Say it , you old fool !
You don &apos;t know ! What !
Stupid !
Janice !
Lord help us the soldiers !
Way !
Way !
Saw it Michal , saw it !
Until the house shakes .
In the meantime to the Meirhof .
Watch out , guys !
Pull out the guns , get ready and go after me !
No !
Jánošík , we cannot lose you !
I &apos;m going first !
In the Lord &apos;s hands , surrender to Jánošík !
Eternal peace .
- The verdict ...
Since the accused and his companions , who have already been punished , are guilty of many swingeing crimes , he has cheated , robbed and murdered , therefore he is sentenced to death !
That the sentence becomes an example for all others , Jánošík is sentenced to this guilty verdict :
You shall be hanged alive on your left thigh , and after death you shall divide four . Judgment shall be executed without delay .
And so ends Jánošík , the first fighter for the freedom of the Slovak people .
Thank you sheep host .
Goodbye .

Leave !
Enough !
I don &apos;t want to hear any more !
It disgusts me , horrifies me !
And yet ... I , who invented it , brewed in nights , in nights ... ah !
You have no idea !
It &apos;s a game for you , spicing up whatever else life has to offer you .
But me !
A thirsty one !
One , close to death ... scorned , hounded , tormented by torments that ...
Ah ! Hell , what nature gave me with this grimace and hump such a feeling , such greed ... oh please , quiet !
The guardians of order are up and full of ambition .
Behind the doors lurk , bribed , the servants ,
- minions hide in the gardens .
You exaggerate , my friend .
Too much scrupulousness is not in place .
The fact that we are not satisfied with peasant maidens and maidens , shopkeepers &quot; daughters and maidens of joy , that we choose the finest and most beautiful , is a sign of our taste .
What was the slogan you gave us a few weeks ago ?
&quot; &quot; Beauty be prey to the strong . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; All the splendor of the earth succumb to the power of the Spirit , &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; and the Glory of the Conquering shine brighter &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; and penetrate deeper , more honourable into the souls &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; than that splendor which only blinds the eye . &quot; &quot;
- Very true !
- That &apos;s how you spoke .
- And since then ...
- What you created , you report .
Flee us !
None of those secret feasts nor saluted you !
Because a few dads wring their hands and a few mothers sob heartbreakingly !
Just don &apos;t think that the beautiful themselves are angry with us .
Yesterday Alissa , the little girl , hei what eyes she made !
And the lovely daughter of the poet &apos;s biparetto , truly , she was delightful !
We snatch them from the arms of our dearest ones who are burdened with everyday life !
The husband , inexperienced in the arts of love , does not weep tears of incomprehension !
From narrow rooms to wide mystical spaces ...
All fairy tales come to life , all dreams of secret nights ...
Dreams of the Orient , they come true !
What no one confesses and longs for , suddenly became a reality !
Quite right , quite right ... It is persuasive .
But on one point , forgive me , I &apos;m not quite right .
You always speak only of yourselves , of you who are good @-@ looking and endowed with grace , and forget me , the cripple .
Come to the feasts as you desire , he will denatuate them to you ... and instead of lust , horror will enter .
You overestimate , my friend , it seems to me , the beauty of women .
There were spring nights .
With the windows open , it dances in .
All sultry magic , floral smell , heavy and numbing .
And I had to leave , shaken by fevers , out into lonely alleyways .
And was looking for a damsel , a depraved one .
Told her , offered her gold , much gold , and yet felt like a beggar asking for alms .
In the light of the lantern she looks at my poor figure with a look ... a smile ...
so shameful that the blood clot in my veins .
There was gold !
On made @-@ up lips , his glint reflects all my misery .
Unflattering words promised a guarantee , but I lacked the strength to spit on myself and to profane Lenznacht .
Gracious Lord , the notary .
- Man , Alviano ...
- You are able to ...
What should the notary public do ?
Don &apos;t worry .
I ask him to be patient for a short time .
What &apos;s the point ?
What are you up to ?
I forgot to trust you .
My island Elysium , with all its buildings , water features and emblazoned gardens , with all its unheard of wonders of art and the treasures of free nature ,
Gifted to the city as a gift for a long time .
You &apos;re out of your mind !
Don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing !
The work of your life !
You spent half your fortune on it , wasting it carelessly ...
Tomorrow evening , after dusk , in the presence of the High Senate and the Podesta , with great pomp
I give it to all the people .
Gentlemen , you are invited .
Yes , but man , do you completely forget ... Have considered everything .
You deliver to us !
Access to the underground hall ... If you are afraid of discovery , avoid it in the future .
But forgive me now .
The gentlemen of the Council I await , and with the notary it still falls to me to determine the donation wording and paragraph .
Hello !
Vitelozzo !
- I am late .
- We notice it !
- And out of breath !
Friends ...
What &apos;s there ?
I &apos;m stunned !
Sancta Maria , what happened ?
- Taken ...
Oh God !
Disgusting !
... of so much beauty !
Oh !
- I thought so !
A woman !
- of course !
No !
- A goddess .
- An angel .
- A flower .
We know that .
- I beg you , be silent !
Where did you see the beauty ?
I rode past the Municipium , where fathers in golden carts drove to some kind of restaurant or festivity of the city .
If not ... what do you think ... ln one of them , so listen ...
My greetings , Signori , and thanks for honouring my modest house by visiting such illustrious guests .
Your simple house ?
O noble Signor Salvago , you are too modest .
The splendour of the rooms we walked through is truly unparalleled in Genoa .
Your praise makes me happy .

Here , my friends , are the knighthoods , from their foreheads you read the names of illustrious families .
And here my only child : my beloved daughter Carlotta .
I &apos;m afraid , Signor , you may find them all too free @-@ spirited .
She disregards , much to my chagrin , society &apos;s norms .
Awareness of your generosity and a very special request that she makes to you ... I warmly welcome you , and if I were allowed to fulfill the desire of the Signorina , I would be happy !
But now , if you please , we , delegated by the high senate ,
Bring to you gratitude and joyful amazement of the high assembly .
Your letter yesterday announces to us a gift , so great and significant , so unexpected and rare in these times .
It is difficult for the citizen to preserve his scanty possessions .
Under his hands the gold , laboriously acquired , melts away , and the taxes and burdens are still increasing .
We wore it , patiently mostly and only rarely grumbling , as the sanctity of our family and the faith in the Madonna remained to us .
But then it breaks into the herd like a wolf , robs us of women , brazenly steals our daughters , and is powerless , helpless ...
But forgive , O Lord , to complain to you of our cares is certainly not the purpose of our mission .
The first ray of light after anxious days , thank you !
The island &apos;s happy name , we take it as a good omen .
Do you remember , Signorina , a rider this morning , dess &apos; black shied away at the sight of the golden carts .
The Duke Antonio Adorno ... the right of opposition ...
we are dependent ...
What can he do about it ...
The rider , however , looked into two sparkling eyes , forgot about it , confused , blinded , to restrain the horse and &apos; almost &apos; with involuntary fall of foot had paid homage to the beautiful , that was you then ?
- I had a lot of fun .
You are cruel .
And if now , fallen off a horse , broken arm or leg ... is it not worth the look of my eyes ?
I would like to give my life for you , but ...
And what if that was what I wanted ?
You are so great , so powerful and strong , so high above me ... I have to stretch myself , see , just look into your oh @-@ so @-@ conquering eyes .
And I would like to see you small and low and poor , deep beneath me , my feet reachable ...
The dead are poor .
But dead and dumb .
And I love the soul that struggles and torments itself , sacrifices itself and suffers for its reward .
Once you &apos;ve died , what &apos;s the use of my love ?
You are the devil &apos;s virgin !
The answer ... lch want to consider it
and give it to you tomorrow .
Hold on , Vitelozzo !
What are you doing ?
- So listen !
- We are in danger !
He delivers us from these lousy citizens !
- Entrance to the underground hall !
- At Our Lady ,
- We have to stop it !
- so let me !
Talk to Adorno !
Do whatever you want , leave me out of the game .
- But you ... a word !
- I know nothing , I want nothing , I am in love , I love ...
Do you hear ?
The plague in you !
That &apos;s the way it goes , you wait another day .
The Senate first seeks the Duke &apos;s approval .
And tonight you are my dear guest .
Like mine , now .
I ask the noble guests not to disdain my invitation , a simple meal .
Signorina , your arm !
You are delicious ,
- Signor Alviano , no really ...
- So is it better for you ?
I was terrified , you suddenly touch your heart
- and turned pale ... - Oh , child &apos;s head , I feel like a fish in water .
But doesn &apos;t my father tell you anything about a request ?
Yes , really .
You forget such important things so quickly ?
- No , but ...
- Well , look ... in front of so many people , it wouldn &apos;t have gone !
And since all my blinking , furtive waving , my asking if you did not have a painting , a rare sculpture , in your possession , to show me was of no use , I fell for it ...
You must consider me a dolt , ignorant of life , simple @-@ minded and silly .
But seldom do I blossom in contact with beautiful women ... So it &apos;s that ... do you understand ?
I understand .
But listen now .
I paint .
Yes , indeed , look not so astonished .
I paint pictures .
Animals and people , trees and lakes ... the sky , the light ... but I prefer to paint souls .
And can you ?
I mean , can you paint souls ?
I don &apos;t know if I can do it , and if I can &apos;t do it , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s always up to me .
It &apos;s so hard to find the models .
Only once , it seemed .
The picture arose so miraculously fine .
Just an ugly shadow between chin and mouth ...
Look , there ... and however I meditated and tried to tinker , he kept coming back .
Already I believe him forever transfixed , as , unexpectedly , treacherous creeps out of the brushes
I gave up the picture .
I haven &apos;t tried anything for a long time .

I would like to paint you .
Me ?
All devils , are you mad ?
Quite right !
That &apos;s the way it should be .
Believe me , you take me seriously , you would be different from the others , the serpents with gentle faces , with enticing eyes , and hearts like devils .
But that &apos;s just me : the same look .
For God &apos;s sake , remember !
Perhaps as a fool in a painting among beautiful men and women , effective as a contrast , with a cap and bells , the hump did not fit badly to the ridicule of the people , immortalized forever !
Silence now !
Don &apos;t forget you &apos;re talking to a lady .
You &apos;re wrong .
Hear me finish !
Where the city expands and the view opens onto the Campagna ,
I have a small house as a workshop .
Early in the morning , when lonely and empty still the streets and squares , the pale light of the early morning plays faintly and gently around the canvas ,
It &apos;s the right time for me to go to work .
A path leads past my cottage , lined with tall cypresses .
You probably know him .
You walked him often
shy and stooped down , lost in thought ...
Suddenly looking suspiciously at the windows , whose curtains the scout was hiding .
But you did not see them .
Then rose , glowing purple , veil shining in a thousand colors , glowing mists , like ghostly heralds , drew near , announcing : the sun ...
And a second miracle happened :
I saw the poor little man raise his head .
Each muscle stretched tightly in the slender body .
Arms raised , spread high to the sky .
So he stepped into the glass , towards the sun .
And I saw him grow taller and taller .
My heart was pounding .
That &apos;s how I painted you , Signor Alviano .
This is how I painted your figure :
striding towards the sun .
But I still lack the face , and I still lack the drunken eye ,
in which all the beauty is reflected .
I &apos;m embarrassed ... I don &apos;t know ... forgive me ... I &apos;ve never been so embarrassed in my life !
Do you want me to finish the painting in my workshop ?
I want to come .
He plays with us like a cat with a mouse .
He has become all too powerful , the High Lord !
His last victory over Branciforte went to his head .
He was spoiled by the people .
- after all , it owes him thanks .
- It pays him .
A noble mercenary , nothing more .
- What is the situation ?
- He did not speak out .
Not for and against .
On the one hand it is gratifying for Genoa &apos;s people , on the other hand the nobility must regret if a valuable piece of land is lost to them .
The Duke &apos;s heart speaks for the people , resolutely in his favour .
Equity , however , and consideration for his friends would require him to be careful ; he would still have to consider it and consult with himself and similar phrases .
He warmly envies the gift .
The whole story is disgusting to him .
The man of the day is Alviano Salvago !
The whole city praises his name .
My daughter Carlotta , not easy to conquer , often spoke of him , sensing his essence .
Now he &apos;s won it by storm .
May Duke Adorno beware !
May he beware , Duke Adorno !
Did you hear it ?
- The mood is bad .
- Are you worried about the pack ?
You spoke differently yesterday .
Yes , yesterday ...
Don &apos;t remind me !
Do you talk to your friend like that ?
Sorry .
But isn &apos;t it enough that I despise myself ?
Shall your scorn heal my wound , and the laughter of my friends turn me to madness ?
What about you , Tamare ?
I don &apos;t recognise you .
The most brilliant gentleman of my court , honoured like no other ,
loved , idolised by women , always in the mood for the greatest pranks .
There are people who see only light , and the darkness is alien to them .
That &apos;s who I was .
Life seemed to me a fountain of joy , from which I drank with thirsty , carefree , thoughtful gusto .
I stretched out my hand , I held the rose , soaked its fragrance , and rubbed the blossom .
If I let myself fall , I fell on moss ; thorns and sharp stones shunned me .
When a friend complained to me of sorrow and pain , I heard him , but did not understand him .
And now all of a sudden I have experienced all the torment of hell , humiliation and shame .
Explain yourself clearly .
Wonderful and beautiful as the day , but uneven to me ...
- a middle @-@ class child .
Well , yes .
And what next ?
When I first spoke to her , I think I didn &apos;t really understand her .
She demanded a sacrifice as a pledge of my love .
But what she coveted ...
Unrhyming stuff , madness , born of the moment , I struggle to fathom , to interpret according to rules of courtly custom .
After one night , awakened by fighting , I believe I &apos;ve found it , and I got on my horse , free and proud like a god , my chest swelling with noble feelings .
And rode through the city , absorbed in dreams , I formed the advertisement and saw the beauty blushing with joy , stunned and moved by the high honor !
A Count Andrae Vitelozzo Tamare captures heart and hand ...
You are truly crazy .
Be patient , Duke !
When I stepped in front of them , as I did the first time , I was already in awe .
Her strange look , her cool , amazed smile puzzled me .
Yet , in order to salvage my faint @-@ hearted heart , I pretended to be proud , exalted and rough , speaking of the sacrifice I would make to her , worse than self @-@ mutilation and death ...
And since I happily got her &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; I completely lost the last remnant of contemplation :
Throw me down to her feet . Of all my goods and rich treasures I stammer wildly confused words .
Embracing her knees , I implore her for forgiveness and mercy !
Tamar , so grab yourself .
Listen , Vitelozzo ?
Who is this woman ?
The Podesta &apos;s daughter , Carlotta .
Ah !
A great painter once told me her name was that of a rare talent .
I would warn you , for some reason , if I did not know how vain such doings are , and how hateful the warner is to him who loves unhappily .
So I &apos;d rather help you than guess .
Ah , if you could ... lch promote yourself .
You don &apos;t know this woman .
But I know the women .
So I &apos;m here for you .
But promise me one thing :
If the message is bad , and I return empty @-@ handed , do not rage against you and me ; be strong , do not despair , cast it behind you , and forget this woman .
Listen , Duke , I want to forget them .
I want to forget them .
But only until she became mine .
Till the breath of her mouth be drunk in me , until those hands be drenched with the fragrance of her hair , until this woman , if she be not my wife , become my harlot .
That would be bad blood .
We are bound by law like all the others .
Don &apos;t forget that .
My friends sent me to ask you :
You may prevent Alviano &apos;s Island &quot; &quot; Elysium &quot; &quot;
- Pass in the town possession .
- All devils , what has Salvago , what does the island have to do with your wicked pranks ?
Magnificent underground rooms , specially created for love feasts ,
opens up an artificial grotto on that island .
When you enter the cave , a blue glow glitters around your eye .
Heavy fragrances confuse your senses , the flames of reddish twitching light , distant music and soft songs beckon you deeper and deeper .
Over an abyss a narrow path leads to the entrance of the cave , dense rose enclosures hide it from your gaze .
But if you discover the secret of the grotto , we are lost .
And does he know what you &apos;re doing ?
Salvago , haha !
A game of nature , if you like , a strange mood .
Genoa &apos;s ugliest man is the creator of the adventure
of this realized idea of beauty .
And he himself ...
He keeps himself away .
Has probably already regretted .
But I don &apos;t understand it .
The glow of the torches gilds everything .
In the frenzy of orgy , ugly becomes beautiful and beautiful becomes ugly .
The opposites disappear into a frenzy !
And this fool Salvago , having bred on his foundation marsh flowers of vice , poisonous herb of sin ... does he betray him , and himself , and you ?
He warned us .
But did not consider how hard to contain passion , once unleashed .
This is my curse : your excesses .
Your ferocity urges me to do deeds that I condemn !
I want to save what can still be saved .
What I promised you , I will keep , because your love separates you from the circle of criminals and because we have been friends since a young age .
But beware , Vitelozzo , you are warned against violence .
Salvago may put a stop to his donation urge for a long time .
He will submit , the savior of the people , otherwise woe to him and woe to you all !
Our time is full of strange things .
I know a woman , she learned to paint like me at school , she painted hands .
Fine , slender , with delicate blue veins , coarse , bony male fists ,
The ringed hand of a woman , lush and tender , with nails , pointed and rosy , flashing like drops of pale blood .
One hand I saw , clawing tightly into blossoming flesh , and another , plucking a rice with gentle fingers from green bushes .
But the strange thing was a picture :
One hand , pale and waxy like that of a dead man , with very long , withered fingers ,
held a bit cramped , what you did not see .
Only a faint purple glow seeped through the ghostly fingers , but this appearance was like mute lamentation ,
like oppressed , whimpering weeping and like a cry , restrained and deathly distressed ,
like a restrained cry for redemption ...
But the meaning of the image ?
The poorest has probably never felt what inspires the artist to great deeds :
of love , or longing for it .
She even had a secret fear that she might one day encounter a mighty event on her way of life , some enchanting spell to which she succumbed .
How strange , fear of failure ?
The driving force of this poor life was greed for fame , and the source from which it drew was suffering .
Not psychologically , a physical suffering .
Your hand , Signorina , is not as calm as your voice , if you want to start painting ...
No !
You &apos;re wrong !
My hand is quite steady , and the story is about to end .
My friend has had a heart condition since she was a teenager .
Too often you want to beat it too violently , and sometimes you felt as if &quot; a hand , a hard , merciless hand , was grasping at the twitching thing and cramping it up , terrible and woe ,
so that it might come to rest !
She has this hand , this cruel hand ,
and has painted her pain .
And if ye deny that ye are moved , so it came nigh to you ?
I loved her ...
So she died ?
I think she &apos;s still alive .
And tell me about your youth or why you are so gloomy and bad @-@ tempered today ... or why your gaze so anxiously flees mine !
What have I done wrong , are you angry with me ?
Signorina Carlotta , if this is only a game , what you are doing , desire to dance or even worse , you are , despite your sweet face and your voice , which sounds like a message from heaven , a devil !
Why should I , who am good to you , be as corrupt and bad as you describe me ?
I ask you for everything , just don &apos;t get angry with me !
Just be patient with me !
I don &apos;t understand , it &apos;s like a dream and I &apos;m afraid ...
Ah , fear not !
You are a man and so completely without belief in yourself .
Is it so unthinkable that a woman would find herself in warm affection , in friendship ?
Haha !
The old story !
But the way you look , with eyes whose lights alone promise ...
And when your mouth smiles , it seems to me as if there is nothing on earth that is called &quot; friendship , &quot; as if this word , this miserable word of consolation , were an absurdity , a lie and a disgrace !
And if it were more ...
I &apos;m not saying it is ...
Shouldn &apos;t there in this vast world , among millions of beating hearts , be one who strove towards you in love ?
Me ... me who hates himself , who flees , who bans the mirrors from the rooms he inhabits !
Fool that you are !
And who , like hardly any other , clings to that which escapes as quickly as a May day :
the little beauty that leaves us women when the first furrow appears in the face !
As soon as we are aware of spring , fruits of blossoms begin to bloom .
The leaves wither and fall off .
And that would be the only thing ?
On sunny days you never went out , depressed and sad , but you knew why .
And the most glorious man , the most blooming tree , did not snatch you out of your anxiety .
And another time , on rainy days , never made you warm and happy , yes , happy , a lonely old man , wrinkled and ugly , who went along the way and looked at you with sunken eyes ?
But when , on a glorious day , in a bed full of the most beautiful flowers , you find some hideous beast that spoils your mood ?
I notice only one thing :
You dodge me with glances , as you did before , so now in words .
But I have to tell you .
Carlotta , consider ... you should know
That I love you .
Carlotta !
Oh God , Signor , what eyes you make .
Have my hands there and kiss them quickly !
But let me get to work .
I need your eyes for my image .
So they &apos;re fine with me .
Carlotta !
Beloved !
I beg you , do not speak
and only looks at me so completely and lowers your gaze deep into mine and thinks of many beautiful things that I am your sun , which scare away all darkness from your life with radiant light .
For God &apos;s sake , Carlotta , I have to be at your feet .
I am so incredibly , so incredibly happy .
I beg you to stay .
And just look at me and remember that you will no longer be lonely and unloved despite your ugliness .
See how calmly I say it , the word that tormented you for so long .
Now it &apos;s over .
Because it &apos;s a word ... and a term ...
Nothing more .
But you must be good to me , Alviano , and tender , my dear !
Because I am a very fragile toy .
Carlotta !
Well , that &apos;s it .
But now come and support me .
I &apos;m exhausted , but you have to ...
With all the help ...
Beloved , what is yours ?
You sweet , you poor ...
You loveliest !
You gave me back my life , my faith in God and humanity .
I want to dedicate everything I have to you .
I want to spread myself under your feet .
I want infinitely good and I want to be tender to you .
Mistress !
The Duke Adorno !
The Duke , what can he possibly want ?
I ask him to wait .
I &apos;ve been hearing voices everywhere since yesterday .
In the air singing and murmuring in the bush ...
Earlier Carlotta &apos;s silver laugh , but that was probably deception .
Oh , Lord , how I have been transformed and happy since the day you first entered my house !
How is your daughter , now my wife , so unspeakably glorious , so mild and beautiful , so full of deep goodness ?
But you are silent .
What &apos;s yours , Podesta ?
I &apos;m confused and blinded .
What you just showed me , it is so unbelievable , that a single human brain was able to devise this realm of magic !
A lot of people helped me .
The artists worked .
I just gave up yearning .
- But where is Carlotta ?
- Come , let us look for them .
Didn &apos;t you hear ?
They are looking for you , Donna Carlotta , and you are hiding , fleeing back into the shadows .
Oh , don &apos;t think bad of me , Duke , I don &apos;t even know what &apos;s wrong with me .
When I said &quot; no &quot; to Count Vitelozzo yesterday , I felt great and strong and strong and happy .
And yet , since I finished the picture that you liked so much ,
the image of Alviano ,
is to me as if there were a little bit of a limp inside , as if my love were no longer the same .
Not poorer , understand me .
But as if he had now given me his everything , his supreme , and I had nothing left to expect ... nothing at all .
And then ... but I don &apos;t know if a woman feels ambivalent about your participation and doesn &apos;t provoke ridicule in you , Duke ?
I beg you , trust me , how are you real and true ,
Signorina !
I entered this island full of secret fear .
As if I had drunk wine , heavy and mixed with enchanting herbs , or that strange potion , brewed from the lifeblood of a lovely virgin !
It is bound to the beauty of dreadful magic , half hidden from the senses , and now unleashed , abandoned to the day , and lustful looks like the limbs of a glorious woman , shamefacedly veiled in the years of longing , suddenly lolling in nakedness ,
Unfolding a thousand charms in front of the loving young man &apos;s drunken eye !
O Duke , who knows life and women , you have sinned against Alviano , but even more against himself , than now , as I saw him , here , with my father , in all this splendor ,
which he created with the flaming power of his spirit , as I saw him , the poorest , who himself has torn the benevolent veils in which pity envelops us , and the strange power that tames the senses , then a word came to mind which the donkey spoke in his only happy hour :
&quot; &quot; But if on a glorious day , &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; in a bed full of the most beautiful flowers , &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; Find some hideous monster ... &quot; &quot;
- To God , Virgin ...
- Let me , Duke !
Calm down , the only happy hour , you said it yourself , he owes it to you .
This may comfort you .
You shall not comfort me .
I don &apos;t want mercy .
Martyrdom and hatred are what I deserve , despair and death !
So hear one last one .
He was not worthy and worthy of your love .
He is not the noble one you think he is .
He is obsessed with evil desires and still today ... he doesn &apos;t want to hear anything .
Ye would slander him , but he is good , and great , and exalted ; and I am wretched , and rejected , and wicked .
I hate myself and the world and you .
Only the night ... this night I love and its shadows .
God bless you .
But come on , I am leading you to your Father .
Go , go !
But let me !
Ah , what a night !
What a scorching summer night !
I want to crawl deep into its blackish light , dive deep into its shining darkness !
With stars I dance the summer night dance . But with goblins I sleep in the bush .
Ah , what a night !
What a scorching summer night !
Ah , what a night !
What a scorching summer night !
With stars I dance the summer night dance . But with goblins I sleep in the bush .
Ah , what a night !
What a scorching summer night !
Where is she , my bride ?
Did nobody see Carlotta ?
What are you fleeing from me ?
No , I &apos;m not running away from you .
So do you know me ?
Don &apos;t know who you are .
But if it were one who loves you , most beautiful ?
Love me ?
&apos;It &apos;s good .
But let me look through your mask , whether your eyes are bright or cloudy .
Are you Alviano ?
No , you &apos;re not .
Beautiful in stature , a handsome lad .
Oh most beautiful Carlotta , how you speak strangely !
Strange , darling ?
Give your hand , ah , it &apos;s soft and warm , and it feels comfy .
There , you feel my heart beating violently !
To you , my sweet one !
But listen , boy , with your hands , so soft and gentle , you hold it gently and must not torment it , you hold it tightly , very gently and quietly .
Come on , sweetheart !
- Short night and morning are near !
- sweet is the night
- Feel my heart beating .
s hurry , the night is short and the morning is near !
- To you , my sweet one !
- To you , you sweet one !
I hear your voice !
It sounds to me from heights , from clefts , a thousandfold !
Song from the air , a mocking song from the depths of hell !
Her form dances before me , peeks out of bushes and hedges , here and there her garment glitters , like a wipe she chases me , uphill and downhill , into the ether , into swamps ... And I held her , she was mine after all !
Or wasn &apos;t she ?
- High Alviano Salvago !
- Who gave us joy !
Bringer of beauty !
Father of the people !
What do you want ?
Silence !
I &apos;m not a king .
A fool , a cripple !
A beggar , an abomination !
Where is my bride ?
Hey , create it for me !
I want to thank you .
I give you everything , my belongings .
Then I am a Prince , a King , a God !
But Carlotta makes me !
I want to thank you !
Then I am a Prince , a King , a God !
High Alviano , Apollo !
The friend of the muses !
Crown him , the king !
Where do you have the crown , the rosary crown ?
Lift up the friend of the people !
Crowns him with roses !
High Alviano !
Let , let ...
Hold on , Genoese people !
Hold on , Beguiled !
Madmen that you are !
You crown him who robbed your daughters , seduced your children , desecrated them , perhaps murdered them .
What is it ?
What does he mean by that ?
The eight !
Terrible !
He ?
Alviano ?

- Do not believe him !
Aha !
The Alberghi .
- The foxes !
- It &apos;s cleverly done !
- The tricky envy !
Defamation !
- High Alviano !
Be quiet !
Silence !
Hear the eight !
Through the Sacred Eight I , Duke Adorno , protector of the people and true friend , raise the accusation against the knight Alviano Salvago .
I accuse him of raping girls , seducing them , and profaning them with chaste virgins ,
- the coupling and inducement to such .
- Was there not a scream ?
Did you not hear a cry ?
By virtue of our power as judges and guardians of justice , we extend the accusation against the knight Alviano Salvago and forgive him , possessed of an evil spirit , who has fallen prey to Satan and evil demons ,
of the enchantment of the people .
We put the spell on the island &quot; Elysium . &quot; &quot;
It shall be destroyed by fire , as a breeding @-@ place of vice and devilish sin .
Knight Salvago , you are ...
You see , that &apos;s what it comes down to !
- They rob us !
- Do not allow us joy !
Cursed robbers !
Beasts !
Down Adorno !
- Death to the Alberghi !
Slay them , the villains !
- All lies !
- Defend yourself !
- Alviano , talk !
- We believe you !
We stand by you !
Alviano , talk !
We protect you !
Towards you , you sweet ones !
t you hear ?
Music ...
- feel my heart beating !
Short night and morning are near .
Cimbeles , flutes , harps ... and wild singing ?
You see , he is possessed by demons , the demon speaks from him !
Alviano , man , your life is at stake . Defend yourself !
He will be embarrassed .
leads him away !
Stop !
Don &apos;t touch him !
We believe him who is silent more than you who speak .
He did us good .
If you want him , give us evidence .
Proof !
Bring that kid .
Explain yourselves , Ginevra !
Ginevra Scotti !
For heaven &apos;s sake , let me go !
Without hesitation , Ginevra Scotti says :
Where were you hidden , eh , seeking help , fleeing to Duke Adorno ?
In the house of Alviano Salvago .
Listen !
Listen !
- Rest !
Who is that ?
Listen !
What do you think ?
What do you not stir ?
Old man , be merciful and let me go !
It dawns on me , terribly clear and clear .
Without hesitation , Ginevra Scotti says :
Who was it that robbed you of freedom and honor ?
A nobleman who called himself Menaldo Negroni .
Aha !
The Alberghi !
Look !
Just listen !
But what about Salvago ?
Out with the truth !
Old man , she is in danger , I see the connections before me !
The head of a horde of desert journeymen , noble robbers , is Alviano Salvago .
Everything was revealed to Count Vitelozzo Tamare , the Duke .
Who said the name ?
Who tore it out of my brain ?
That &apos;s it !
He robbed her .
He pursued her .
He wooed her . I know , I know ....
Are you talking wrong ?
Ginevra robbed Count Vitelozzo ?
Who speaks of Ginevra ?
Who is she ?
I know nothing about her !
Carlotta !
Oh , dog !
You wretched !
You animal !
If I had you there , I would tear you to pieces , beast , with my teeth !
Come , I will lead you .
Can you see the blue glow up there ?
Do you hear ?
Listen !
Isn &apos;t it music ?
Great and wicked , screams and cheers ...
People of Genoa !
I will lead you ! To your disgraced daughters !
To my poor , lost bride !
Then I will speak to you and you shall judge .
But woe betide the others !
Woe !
Death to them !
You &apos;re lying !
You are mistake. I am speaking the truth .
Listen , it may well be that she did not wake up ,
That she slept over into the world .
And look , it was so much for me .
I &apos;ve had nothing .
In my whole life , this woman was the only great thing , the only beautiful thing .
Understand when you tell me :
&quot; &quot; I robbed her , took her by force , &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; I could not help because I loved her ... &quot; &quot; So I must hate you and must curse you because you have destroyed a poor man like me , taking away what he had .
But in there , deep down , something like that would remain , understand me , like a painful consolation .
But if you tell me :
&quot; &quot; She &apos;s given herself to me , &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; She , Carlotta , voluntarily , in love , &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; And she was happy , &quot; &quot; yes , indeed , you said &quot; &quot; happy , &quot; &quot;
well , then ... then I didn &apos;t have anything , then you didn &apos;t take anything from me , then I &apos;m just as miserable again ... just as miserable as I was ...
Thrown back into the void ...
And if you murder me , I have nothing else to tell you .

This woman , from the first day I saw her , had fallen in love with me , according to the word that you yourself , Alviano , once said :
&quot; &quot; Beauty be prey to the strong . &quot; &quot;
You thought you were strong , for an hour , but you were not .
The joy offered itself to you , then you jerk off to her , trembling and cowardly .
You saw only the dark , the shadows , danger and sin .
Far too harshly marked by fate , you were paralysed , unfree , despondent .
For your kind , the precious flower lives only in dreams , but it blooms bright and enticing during the day , as dream , mirage , nocturnal spooks imagine .
Because , Alviano , didn &apos;t you say Carlotta , too ?
What didn &apos;t you take ?
Because , because ...
O devil , do not ask that , eh , the hell you go , I expose a crime to the whole world ,
So awful ...
Because I look into depths you don &apos;t know , because I &apos;m a human being and you ?
Don &apos;t know who &apos;s looking deeper from the two of us .
Don &apos;t know what &apos;s higher :
a joyless life , a slow sickness or a death in intoxication and transfiguration , a blissful death in a burning embrace !
How am I ?
The meaning of your words , that is not possible ... Her lips begged for pity , stammered the ancient song of fearful defense .
But her eyes begged for pleasure .
Out of her mouth came an excruciating confession , fear and horror ...
But in his eyes , wildly irrepressible , the sparks of kindled desire were sparking .
Finally it made its way :
Greater than you , she created herself free .
The glittering dance in her laughing eyes was accompanied by wild drunken singing from her lips :
&quot; &quot; Give death , &quot; &quot; her look exulted ,
&quot; &quot; Give it a go , &quot; &quot; she said .
Terrible !
Knowing you have , Unsel &apos;ger ...
Just roll your eyes , grit your teeth and clench your fists !
My most blessed hour , no one robs me of it !
So say a prayer !
You have nothing on me , what do you want ?
At a church dedication &apos; a hunchbacked fiddler played in a fine manner &apos; .
The most beautiful of the beautiful , that was his sweetheart .
I picked her out of the dancing swarm and carried her away .
He rushed after me , so he stood in front of me like that , distorted , distorted and full of hate !
I killed him with his fiddle .
Just come to me . With my hands I slay you all !
So die , folks !
Who was screaming ?
Wasn &apos;t that ... my dear ?
No , no , look at me , Alviano ...
Carlotta , beloved ... lch am with you , he lied , lied , lied !
Away , away !
An album !
A Night Face !
Help !
Hu , how that pushes !
And the red light !
Woe betide !
Give me water .
No , give me wine .
And let my sweetheart come , my beautiful , sweeter ... lch want Vitelozzo , before I die ... lch want , I want ...
Yes , where &apos;s the fiddle ... lch has to go to the church dedication . &apos;
And my cap , my beautiful cap ...
Red and with silver bells .
Did no one see the cap ?
Let me , I finally have to ...
Hold on ... what was that ?
There is one ... You good people ,
There &apos;s a dead man there .
A presentation from a cultural and historical perspective in moving images in 7 chapters .
BENJAMIN CHRISTENSEN wrote and produced the book between 1919 and 1921 .
For the photography I am grateful to Mr. Johan Ankerstjerne and for the artistic direction Mr. Richard Louw .
My main sources are mentioned in the film programme .
Let us look into the history of mysticism and try to bring clarity to a mysterious chapter known as the Witch .
The belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind .
When primitive man is confronted with something inexplicable , the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits .
In Persia , the fantasy beings depicted in the following image were believed to be responsible for diseases .
The English scholar Rawlinson and the French scholar Maspero show us pictures of evil spirits believed to be native to the oldest cultures .
Belief in evil spirits , sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naive notions of the secrets of the universe .
Here we see how the Egyptians imagined the constitution of the world
( according to Maspero ) .
The ancient Egyptians believed the high mountains enclosed land and water from all sides .
The sky was made of steel , supported by strong pillars that stood on the highest mountains .
The stars hung like lamps on ropes from the sky .
According to the beliefs of other historical cultures , the sky was vaulted and the earth was shaped into terraces .
In medieval folklore , the evil spirits of the past became devils who crept around and seduced children .
The devils lived in the core of the earth .
In the later Middle Ages , the earth was regarded as a fixed sphere in the middle of the universe .
Above the earth and its waters -
- people in the Middle Ages imagined a layer of air -
- then a layer of fire -
- and outside of the fire were the planets , moving celestial bodies .
Each planet was bound to its transparent , movable orbit .
Outside the orbits of the planets , the fixed stars stood in their own sky
Above all , in a tenth crystal orbit , sat the Almighty , surrounded by angelic choirs , and he was the one who kept the world machine going .
Deep down in the core of the earth lies hell , where those deceived by the devil should suffer for eternity .
In the upper part of the following picture ,
( by the French historian Lacroix )
The devils stuff the damned in large pots .
A sinner is thrown directly into the fire that burns under one of the cauldrons .
A devil pours disgusting sulfur through a horn seeping into the throat of a man .
Two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth .
I have found a peculiar mechanical figure of hell that provides a good understanding of the faith in the Middle Ages .
See with what zeal the devils take care of the fire under the cauldron !
During the Middle Ages , the devil and hell were believed to be true and constantly feared .
Witches , it was believed , made a dishonourable pact with the devil , and therefore they were burned .
The floating figure is a devil who comes to get the witch by lifting her into the air .
These images of a pyre , as well as the following , are from &quot; German Life of the Past in Pictures . &quot;
In this picture a witch milks an axe handle .
In the following picture a witch has bewitched a man &apos;s shoe .
Witches usually meet in circles .
After the meeting , for example , they sneaked into a stable and bewitched a cow .
The small angular symbol below the picture was usually carved into the stable door to protect it from witches .
In this old , naïve drawing , a sorcerer and a witch , throwing curses , set a city on fire .
It was believed that witches used powders and magical potions from magicians to punish people with diseases
Note that the sick person is lying naked in bed .
It was common then .
It was common belief that witches danced naked with the devils at night , during the so @-@ called witches &quot; Sabbath .
Women who wanted to take part in this &quot; Sabbath &quot; snuck up to the magician
where they could have their backs smeared with &quot; witches &quot; ointment .
The magic power of the ointment allowed them to fly through the air .
The French doctors Bourneville and Teinturier gave me the following images of the witch Sabbath , a secret satanic rite in which thousands of women declared their participation .
On the Sabbath , witches and sorcerers first profaned the Holy Cross of the Church .
Satan gives devil names to all involved .
And a ceremonial feast was held .
Sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows .
All witches had to pay their respects to the devil by kissing his butt .
After a merry dance with the devils , the witches flew home with the first cock crowing .
Such scenes are often found on well @-@ known pictures of the witches Sabbath from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance .
To be continued .
HAXAN Chapter 2
We are now going to the underground home of a sorceress in the year of the Lord 1488 .
&quot; Tonight the stars shine favorably over the Gallows Hill . &quot;
&quot; Uhh , what a stench !
The thief &apos;s body hung on the gallows for too long . &apos;
&quot; If such a thief &apos;s finger has dried up too much , it can no longer give the brew healing powers . &quot;
&quot; Hurry up and get up , Karna , so that passers @-@ by don &apos;t see me . &quot;
&quot; Karna , can you make me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the Church ? &quot;
&quot; Here young maiden , take a drink of cat droppings and pigeon hearts , cooked in the moonlight . &quot;
&quot; A drop of it in a man &apos;s drink will soften his heart immediately . &quot;
&quot; Karna , can I have an even stronger drink ? &quot;
&quot; If the maiden wishes to rob the senses of the man for the sake of love ... &quot;
... &quot; I made a potion in May from a young and playful male swallow . &quot;
&quot; Keep your money , pretty woman !
Smell my ointment first ! &quot;
&quot; This ointment is good if you want to travel to the chunk one night . &quot;
&quot; Smear the ointment secretly on it and the pious monk will immediately come into your chamber . &quot;
&quot; You will fly high together in the night and he will give you many hungry kisses . &quot;
&quot; Listen brother , should we not pray before we begin with such an audacious plan ? &quot;
&quot; Oh Holy Mother of God , forgive us for opening this dead body with a knife ! &quot;
&quot; It is not incongruous curiosity that makes us sin so badly ... &quot;
... &quot; but that in this way the cause of many terrible diseases is opened up to us . &quot;
Help !
Quick !
The peace of the cemetery was disturbed by two witches . &quot;
This was the Middle Ages , when witchcraft and the work of devils were sought everywhere .
And that &apos;s why strange things were thought to be happening .
Damn woman !
You shall not lie here and bewitch the legs of honourable people . &quot;
&apos;Watch out !
Now let your dirty mouth be open forever . &quot;
So it was with witchcraft and the devil ;
The belief of the people was so strong that it became .
The devil is everywhere and takes all forms .
He is a nightmare , an angry demon , a seducer , a lover and a knight .
The devil &apos;s companion can be young and pretty , but more often she is old and ugly .
Is it the eternal fear of the stake that you get drunk every night , medieval woman ?
When the evening bell rings and all the fires of the city are covered with ashes , the devil summons Apelone for his adventures .
High in the air is Apelone &apos;s dream castle , and there the devil will grant her all her secret wishes .
To be continued .
HAXAN Chapter 3 .
In Franz Heinemann &apos;s &quot; The Judge and the Administration of Justice in the German Past , &quot; we can see pictures of inquisition judges at work .
A woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out if she is guilty or not .
Edward Fuchs shows us in &quot; Moral History &quot; how the accused is bound .
Two men let the accused into the water by straps where she has no support .
When it swims it is pulled up and burnt .
When she sinks , the judges thank God for her innocence .
I will now present a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end , which took place when the Pope sent travelling inquisitors to Germany .
&quot; My husband could not suddenly suffer from dizziness if he had not been bewitched by a sorceress ! &quot;
&quot; Be comforted Anna , wife of the printer , the power of lead will soon reveal it . &quot;
&quot; Oh you mighty Saturn , allow this lead to show if Jesper the printer is bewitched . &quot;
&quot; It is written here in the form of lead that dizziness is cruel witchcraft . &quot;
&quot; Oh Peter , look , where is the evil sorceress ? &quot;
&quot; You may see the witch sooner than you like ... &quot;
... &quot; earlier than I would like . &quot;
&quot; Jesus &quot; Holy Cross and Wounds !
I didn &apos;t hear you coming , weaver Mary ! &quot;
&quot; Oh young woman , feel sorry for me , a poor woman who has to go door to door begging ! &quot;
&quot; Are you hungry Mary ?
If so , sit down . &quot;
&quot; Here , eat if you can , in the name of Jesus . &quot;
&quot; Watch out little sister , watch out .
This woman &apos;s got evil eyes . &apos;
&quot; The youngest servant of the Inquisition does not exchange a word with a strange maiden . &quot;
How marvellous !
It felt like fire when the young maiden touched my arm . &quot;
&quot; Young woman , are you aware that what you are accusing this woman threatens her life ?
&quot; Swear by the Cross that you are not mortal enemies ! &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s go , young man , before her feet take off so that the wicked witch does not turn us all into mice . &quot;
&quot; Now you will get the hot death you deserve , you damn servant of the devil ! &quot;
To be continued .
HAXAN Chapter 4
Two &quot; honest &quot; housemaids move the accused in prison so that she cannot carry hidden witch powder with her .
&quot; Mary the weaver is accused of witchcraft . &quot;
&quot; Master , look closely , there could be witch powder hidden in the sorceress &apos;s hair . &quot;
The nights of the accused are now dictated by the inquisitors .
Two respectable men try to make her confess .
If she stubbornly denies her guilt , they will use some kind of mental torture .
&quot; Woman , look here at the seven holy words of the crucified Jesus written on blessed parchment .
&quot; I hang it around her neck so that the devil can no longer help her to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Does she see this length of blessed wax as the Corpus Christi ? &quot;
The defendant is led backwards to the torture chamber so that she cannot bewitch the judge when she enters .
&quot; One last time I ask :
Will she confess her witchcraft and misdeeds ? &quot;
&quot; Let their suffering begin so that we can put an end to the hardness of their heart . &quot;
&quot; Oh , scholar !
How am I supposed to confess something that wasn &apos;t ? &apos;
&quot; So then , executioner Rasmus !
Let the evil sorcerer &apos;s body ache . &quot;
&quot; Let her breathe , executioner Rasmus , and loosen the screw a little when she confesses her sins . &quot;
&quot; Oh scholar !
I confess that I gave birth to many children to the devil . &quot;
&quot; And when I gave birth , Karna and her whole circle of witches helped me . &quot;
&quot; If I am spared the pain , I will confess that Trina smeared me with witches &quot; ointment . &quot;
&apos;Oh yes , man , I &apos;ve flown through the air at night on Trina &apos;s broom . &apos;
&quot; And the devil &apos;s grandmother was there , with all her witchcraft . &quot;
&apos;And a woman who didn &apos;t do enough evil deeds was cruelly treated by the devil . &apos;
&quot; And many spat on everything that is sacred . &quot;
&quot; And a meal of toads and unbaptized children was cooked by Karna . &quot;
&quot; Listen to Mary the weaver , have you also seen the devil putting his mark on the forehead of witches ? &quot;
&quot; Oh scholar , I saw the witches kissing the butt of the evil one . &quot;
&quot; And Anna &apos;s mother , the wife of the printer , who wished me a hot death - &quot;
&quot; - That damn woman , I saw her kissing the wicked one so tenderly ... and Sissel , her servant , the old fool , was also there . &quot;
&apos;And Elsa , who kicked me some time ago , she &apos;s supposed to burn at the stake as well .
<unk> walked past Schreiber Martin &apos;s door , on a moonlit night , with her sister . &apos;
&quot; And they put a curse on Martin the scribe with the water they threw at his door .
&quot; And it was the same night that death brought Martin the scribe . &quot;
&quot; And now I &apos;m going to tell you all about the witches who screamed after me in the street I live in . &quot;
To be continued .
HAXAN Chapter 5
In this way , in the age of witches , the wheels began to turn endlessly .
Each witch accused ten other witches .
The city supervisors were busy .
If you oppose the arrest of a witch , you have to be one yourself .
The fate of young Anna , the printer &apos;s wife , is sealed .
So there are only two people left in the haunted house of Jesper the printer .
In the witch age it was dangerous to be old and ugly , but it was also not safe to be young and pretty .
&quot; Brother help me .
I &apos;ve got sinful thoughts . &apos;
&quot; Uncover your body , brother ! &quot;
&quot; I will whip your sinful body and your poor soul to pray for healing . &quot;
&quot; Oh brother , why do you stop beating ?
Now my soul is surely damned . &quot;
&quot; Father Henrik , brother John is enchanted . &quot;
&quot; A witch came into his cell to seduce him . &quot;
&apos;And she &apos;s grabbed him by the wrist . &apos;
&quot; Get up brother , father Henrik is coming . &quot;
&quot; Brother , you didn &apos;t give up virginity for a witch , did you ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know the punishment for those who refuse to testify against a witch ? &quot;
And so they grab you , young maiden , and submit you to their infallible test .
&quot; In the name of the Holy Trinity , if you are not a witch , you are now forgetting tears ! &quot;
&quot; See for yourself - you cannot weep because you are in league with evil . &quot;
We now assume that the young woman resisted ;
that no threat or pain can bring them to confess .
I tried to figure out how the extraordinary inquisitors behaved in such circumstances .
And I see a few scenes here that I don &apos;t think are too bleak for the screen .
&quot; Wake up young maiden !
I &apos;ll bring you great joy . &apos;
&quot; Look young maiden , I give you freedom if you do me a small favor . &quot;
&quot; Why do you ridicule me , monk ?
What can a poor creature like me give you ? &quot;
&quot; Teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water ! &quot;
&apos;If you don &apos;t believe me , young girl , get up and look at the court . &apos;
&quot; Were the guards gone ? &quot;
&apos;Yes , they &apos;re far away .
The keys are now in my hand and I can secretly take you out through the city gates tonight . &quot;
&quot; And I swear to be silent about all that you reveal to me of witchcraft with thunder . &quot;
&quot; Remember that Jesper , the printer &apos;s child , is all alone in the world with no relatives except you two ? &quot;
&quot; Oh father Henrik , look at the tears of the young maiden .
Look , she &apos;s crying , so she can &apos;t be a witch . &apos;
&quot; Silly boy ! Don &apos;t you know that witches secretly smear themselves with saliva to make us believe they are tears ? &quot;
&quot; Here maiden , see the boy who perishes without you as a dishonourable , outcast witch offspring . &quot;
&quot; Stay here and listen to all the words of the maiden so that you can testify against her later . &quot;
&quot; Will you secretly open the prison gates for me and the child when I speak ? &quot;
&quot; Then I will tell you that a wandering stonemason once told me ... &quot;
... &quot; when witches call for thunder , they put their hands in the water ... &quot;
Before the sun sets tomorrow , you will burn at the stake . &quot;
&quot; And then they will burn you , maiden ,
&quot; for the edification of men , as a sweet fragrance for God . &quot;
And pyre after pyre burned in the city , until one day the judges went to the next city .
The witch craze raged , like a spiritual plague wherever these judges appeared .
Within a few centuries , more than 8 million women , men and children were burned as witches .
To be continued .
HAXAN Chapter 6
There are witchcraft confessions that are totally crazy .
Many women confessed , for example , that they - transformed into cats - defiled the altar at night , while two devils in the form of animals watched at the church door .
But there are also confessions that may well be close to the truth , at the time of superstition .
Many women were burned for confessing to having made a wedding bed by &quot; tying the knot &quot; !
Every lump destroys a pregnancy .
And the happiness of an entire house could be destroyed with witch hair and metal crosses .
Many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effect .
But when we go after the confessions , we have to take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber .
You and I would also be made to admit mystical abilities with the help of such instruments .
Or not ?
French doctor Paul Regnard describes how this collar was used
The collar was fastened with four ropes .
The defendant &apos;s ankles and wrists were tied to two bars fastened to the ground .
When a fire bowl was placed under the poor victim -
- his movements were so violent that the tips of the collar pierced his neck .
Doctor Regnard shows another picture that speaks for itself .
It is simply called &quot; after the questioning . &quot;
The &quot; painful interrogation &quot; preferably began with a &quot; lighter &quot; torture :
The thumbscrew , for example .
One of my actresses insisted on trying the thumbscrew when we shot these pictures .
I am not going to divulge the terrible confessions I made to this young woman in less than a minute .
In the monasteries in the Middle Ages , the fear of the devil escalated into almost hopeless despair .
The pious indulged in numerous deplorable self @-@ punishments .
Often only a single nun was affected and suddenly the whole monastery was affected by madness -
- a mysterious , infectious madness .
In writings that have survived to this day , these unfortunate women wrote with touching simplicity how the devil penetrated the monastery .
&quot; Depart from me Satan ! &quot;
&quot; May all the saints help me !
Sister Cecilia conspires with evil . &quot;
How must these women have suffered before their nerves gave way and the madness erupted ?
Her biographies contain this desperate exclamation :
The devil has forced us !
&quot; Oh , Holy Mother , evil has a terrible power ! &quot;
&apos;Look at me now , he &apos;s forcing me to do what I least want to do . &apos;
&quot; Burn me at the stake pious father !
Do you not see what the devil is forcing me to do ? &quot;
&quot; Take me !
Don &apos;t you see him ?
The devil is standing over there threatening me . &quot;
To be continued
HAXAN Chapter 7
Let us now leave the obsession of the devil
( speaking in foreign tongues and cramps )
And come to the present day .
Most of the witches of old were poor women ;
those that are received today by religious organizations or sororities .
One or more characteristics that made an old woman stand out were enough to bring her to justice at the time of the witch hunt .
Let us not believe that the devil belongs only in the past .
The dear old woman who plays Maria the weaver in my film once raised her tired face to me during a break in filming -
- and said , &quot; The devil is real .
I &apos;ve seen him sitting on the edge of my bed . &apos;
With her consent I showed her a prayer book in which a woman ( from 1921 !

She thinks she can see the devil through her eyes .
The delusion of the witch can be explained as nervous exhaustion which I would like to explain here .
I want the viewer to know that in the following I have the same actress portray different patients with related nervous disorders .
Personally , I knew a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep .
Why did she keep doing the same thing she feared the most ?
Like a witch driven by the devil , this woman , when asleep or awake , gave in to the mysterious desire to light matches .
Did this obsession have anything to do with her mortal fear of fire after one broke out in her house ?
She said she felt like she was fighting an unknown force , stronger than her own .
Isn &apos;t there something &quot; witchy &quot; about this sleepwalker sneaking through the slumbering household with her matches ?
Does she not remind us of the nun walking through the chapel with her knife , driven by the devil ?
This poor woman , even in a confused state , does what she fears most in her sleep .
This obsession - these somnambulous , dazed constitutions - fits with a mental illness we call hysteria .
And there are even more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person .
We remember , for example , that the witch received nightly visits from the devil .
Today it is not the devil but rather a famous actor , a popular clergyman or a well @-@ known doctor who disturbs the tranquility of the night .
The hysterical person will no doubt say that these celebrities came through the wall or the window .
See how consciously this unconscious woman clings to her bed .
A person suffering from hysteria always shows some artificial peculiarities .
In the Middle Ages it was believed that the devil on the Sabbath brought invisible marks on the body of witches , on which all feelings disappeared .
The executioner often found numb spots on the defendants &quot; backs .
&quot; I can clearly see that you are a witch .
You don &apos;t even feel Master &apos;s instrument on your back . &apos;
Today , this strange numbness is seen as a symptom of hysteria .
&apos;No , I don &apos;t feel anything on my back . &apos;
&quot; Yes , as I thought ; her daughter suffers from hysteria . &quot;
&quot; After what they told me I have to advise to keep their daughter in the clinic for the time being . &quot;
&apos;It would be a shame if her daughter had an unpleasant encounter with the police , &apos; he said .
Poor little hysterical witch !
In the Middle Ages you were in conflict with the Church .
Now it &apos;s the law .
&quot; Please come to my office . &quot;
&quot; Or should I call the police ? &quot;
Her name ?
Can they identify themselves ? &quot;
&quot; Your address ?
Do they have a phone at home ? &quot;
&apos;Well , thank you .
You can go .
I &apos;ll come back later . &apos;
&apos;When my family hear about it , I &apos;m forcibly locked away . &apos;
&quot; I ask her to understand that I am an unhappy , sick person .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing . &apos;
&apos;I couldn &apos;t live with the constant fear during the war .
I &apos;m a broken person . &apos;
&quot; It is as if an unknown force forces me to commit these terrible thefts . &quot;
&quot; See them here !
I just stole a small , expensively bound Russian book . &quot;
&quot; What do I mean by that ?
I can &apos;t speak a word of Russian . &apos;
&quot; My husband died in the war and since then I am no longer myself ... &quot;
&apos;I promise I won &apos;t pursue it further , but I have to ask them never to enter my shop again . &apos;
Centuries have passed and the Almighty from the Middle Ages no longer sits in his tenth sphere .
We no longer sit in the church and stare anxiously at the devil &apos;s frescoes .
The witch no longer flies over the roofs on her broom .
But isn &apos;t superstition still ubiquitous ?
Is there a big difference between the sorceress and her customers then and now ?
We no longer burn our old and poor .
But don &apos;t they often suffer bitterly ?
And the little woman we call hysterical , alone and unhappy , isn &apos;t she still a mystery to us ?
Nowadays , we confine the unlucky to a lunatic asylum or , if they are wealthy , to a modern clinic .
And then we can calm down with the idea that the mild @-@ tempered shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of the Middle Ages .

People &apos;s Commissariat for Post and Telegraphy

Orlac &apos;s hands
It &apos;s nine o &apos;clock and the train will arrive at eleven .
To Montgeron ... !
He &apos;s alive !
It &apos;s 5 : 30 , Professor .
clock Vasseur is executed ... and 8 minutes later the car will take the body to the clinic .
A train wreck .
Orlac is seriously injured .
There is still hope ... a skull fracture that we will operate on ... but his hands ...
Save his hands ... his hands are his life ....
Save his hands ... his hands are more important than his life .
Save his hands ...
I &apos;ll try .
Just a short while and you can come home ... and sun , light and lots of flowers will greet you when you come .
We want to give you back your husband ... in part , at least .
Today you should be able to see his face again .
Your eyes ... how I love your hair and your hands ... your beautiful , tender hands ...
There ... this head ... does he not look at my hands ?
He laughs ... !
Now ... he &apos;s gone !
Tell me ... what &apos;s under those bandages ?
What secret are they hiding ?
So , for heaven &apos;s sake , let &apos;s reveal the secret ...
Will these hands ever be able to play again ?
The mind dominates the hands ... Nature and a strong will can overcome everything .
Tomorrow ... he &apos;s coming tomorrow !
I will be waiting for him here ... his first kiss and the first caress of his beloved hands .
Last night .
Their hands could not be saved ...
Dr. Seral has given you others - the hands of the executed predator Vasseur !
Is it true ?
Do I have the hands of the robber and murderer vasseur ... ?
How much longer ?
Still half an hour ...
No , only thirty minutes .
These hands will never be allowed to touch another person .
How much longer ?
I love you ...
I love you ...
Do you have the January 15 newspaper for me ?
I feel it coming from you ... along the arms ... until it finally takes hold of the soul ... cold , terrible , merciless .
Damn ... damn ... hands !
Don &apos;t come any closer !
Go away ...
I will not obey you any more .
Tomorrow I &apos;ll go to his dad if you can &apos;t convince him !
t touch me ... your hands hurt ... like the hands of a murderer ...
Take them away !
I don &apos;t want them - those wretched things !

Just give us a little reprieve ...
I tell you ...
They demand blood ...
Crime ...
Murder ...
Just a week !
The hands do not control the person ...
The head , the heart dominate the body ... command also the hands ...
See you tomorrow ? !
Hat and coat ...
I go to see Paul &apos;s father .
He &apos;s rich ... he can help ... if he wants ...
Don &apos;t go there ... he &apos;s a bad man ... he hates all people ... and most of all our Lord ...
I &apos;m not allowed to let anyone in ... last but not least anyone from ... there .
<unk> &apos;s DAVID LLOYD reflects on the calamity that unfolded ...
Mr Orlac can &apos;t play now .
That &apos;s why we got into trouble .
Paul doesn &apos;t know anything about it yet ... help us !
He is your son ... your flesh and blood ... would you make him penniless ?
Yes , I want that !
I hate him ... !
Mr. Orlac has to go to his father himself ... still today !
How does gracious woman expect to pay ?
Sweetheart ! One more night and one more day and then I will be with you again . I will embrace you in my arms ... my hands will glide over your hair .
And I will feel your body shake under my hands ...
Once ... that was ... my handwriting ...
Go to your father ... today ... he must help us ... it cannot go on like this ...
Murder !
The knife of the murderer , vasseur ! ?
The fingerprints of the executed vasseur !
Vasseur &apos;s signature !
I do not know what mystery surrounds us -
Vasseur has been dead for years , but his hands are alive !
Paul Orlac , you are the heir of your father .
They &apos;re going to bring me a million tomorrow .
At this time , here !
Money ? !
Money ? !
And for that you persecute me in the wake and in my dreams ?

For my hands !
Who are you ?
I am a vasseur , executed on July 13 ...
The same experiment Professor did with your hands , his assistant did with my head .
If I don &apos;t have the million tomorrow at this time ... the prosecutor the day after tomorrow will know who your father &apos;s killer is ...
Who is the murderer ?

Paul Orlac !
The fingerprints that are visible everywhere are the prints of the vasseur &apos;s fingers , and who has those fingers now ?
YOU !
The letter that lured the old servant away from the house was from Vasseur &apos;s hand , and that hand is now yours !
The knife used to carry out the murder is Vasseur &apos;s X @-@ rated knife .
Your girl will swear that she saw it ... in YOUR HAND ... !
You may not have committed the murder - but you won &apos;t be able to prove it ...
What happens to me ?
Am I crazy ?
t you want to tell me what torments you ?
I know it , I feel it , these hands lead me into crime ....
I have to bring him the money .
I will tell the prosecutor everything ...
Who will believe me ?
They will believe you as I believe you .
I come here as a free man .
Stay there , you might have some news for the evening papers .
A strange encounter , so peculiar that I do not know if it is true or a dream ....
A stranger .
He was ... the one who was executed ...
I saw with my own eyes the sign of the guillotine on his neck ...
Thank you , Mr Orlac , for your statement ...
Go there tonight .
Bring the money to the stranger - we will take care of everything else ...
An old acquaintance of Mr. Nera , most recently Professor Serral &apos;s medical assistant ...
One of the most talented crooks in the world .
So I &apos;m an extortionist .
But you are looking for a murderer ... !
Did you not notice that the murder was committed by Vasseur &apos;s hands ... ?
! I don &apos;t have those hands ...
Let me tell you who has such hands .
Mr Orlac , you have been arrested !
Mr Orlac is innocent and Mr Nera is the murderer .
Silent !
Speak ! Where do the fingerprints of the executed vasseur come from ?
Nera was Vasseur &apos;s friend ... secretly he made wax impressions of Vasseur &apos;s fingers .
And then he made rubber gloves ... with Vasseur &apos;s fingerprints .
And so he killed the elder Orlac ...
And he also killed the old moneylender , and directed the suspicion at Vasseur . Vasseur died innocent .
If Vasseur was innocent ... my hands are clean ...

PARIS IN SLEEP
One night Paris goes to sleep and the next morning the night watchman of the Eiffel Tower wonders why nothing moves in the city and nobody comes ...
For the police chief

&apos;Everyone froze last night except me at the top of the tower , &apos; he said .
&apos;And us on the plane . &apos;
A thief is always useful .
&apos;Let &apos;s not give up . &apos;
&quot; I will see to it that the doors of the shops open for you , as well as those of the Bank of France . &quot;
All of Paris belongs to them .
But what good is all wealth if you get bored ?
&quot; If anyone can hear me , we &apos;ll meet on Avenue de ... a handkerchief at the window ... &quot;
&quot; From here the fateful ray was sent forth to put the whole world to sleep . &quot;
&quot; It was my uncle , Professor Ixe ! &quot;
&quot; You have to wake up the world ! &quot;
&apos;I didn &apos;t think so ! &apos;
&apos;I &apos;m going to try . &apos;
&quot; 3 : 25 , the same hour ! &quot;
&quot; You betrayed me ! &quot;
&quot; We need to raise some money with the help of your uncle &apos;s invention . &quot;
&quot; The whole world lay asleep for four days . &quot;
&apos;You &apos;re all telling the same story ! &apos;
&apos;We &apos;re all telling the truth . &apos;
&quot; Go and tell your stories somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; Have we dreamed all this ? &quot;
&quot; No , it wasn &apos;t a dream ! &quot;

The manager .
&apos;Thief ! &apos;
&apos;Thief ... &apos;
&quot; Comrades ! The administrator accuses me of theft .
I am innocent , but I cannot prove it .
I can &apos;t go out of my way to accuse him of being a thief .

&quot; A six @-@ hour working day for minors . &quot;
&apos;They &apos;re asking for a 30 % pay rise . &apos;

Police .
&apos;Sit down ! &apos;
&apos;And that &apos;s not all ... &apos;

2 ) The wage increase ... 4 ) The right behavior .
At a previously agreed place .
Civil action by the management is recommended only if the workers comply unconditionally .

Act I &quot; PEOPLE AND WORMS &quot;
The spirit of revolution hovered over the Russian countryside .
Some vast , mysterious process took place in countless hearts .
Individuality , which had only just recognized itself , was absorbed in the mass , and the mass in the great élan .
The sailors Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk .
We sailors of the Potemkin must support the workers , our brothers , and place ourselves in the first ranks of the revolution !
Difficult and dark is the sleep of the free watch .
Vigilant , but clumsy .
You vent your anger at the newcomer .
Sickening ...
Vakulinchuk
Comrades !
It is time for us to speak up too .
What are we waiting for ?
All Russia has risen up !
Shall we be the last ?
In the morning .
Enough is enough , we don &apos;t want to eat rotten stuff anymore !
A dog wouldn &apos;t eat that !
The ship doctor Smirnov .
That creeps overboard by itself !
These are not worms .
These are dead fly larvae .
Can be washed off with brine !
In Japan , Russian prisoners are catered for better than we are !
We don &apos;t want to eat rotten stuff anymore !
The meat is good .
No quarrel !
The First Officer Gilyarovsky
The impotent rage boiled over .
The canteen .
The sailors refuse to eat the borsch .
Our daily bread
Act II &quot; THE DRAMA OF TENDRA &quot;
Commander Golikov
Who is satisfied with the borsch two steps ahead !

Step away !
The rest I hang on the rails !
Watch out on deck !
Under the pretext of letting them step out of line , Matyushenko gathers the sailors at the gun tower .
To the tower ...
To the tower !
To the tower ...
Guys !
Come on !
The majority crowded around the tower .
Stop !
Not one step further !
They tried to escape through the admiral &apos;s hatch .
Back , Channel 4 !
The way is not for you !
I &apos;ll knock you off like dogs !
Cover with the tarpaulin !
To command , cover !
Cover !

Oh Lord !
Bring the disobedient to their senses !
On the tarpaulin - puts on !
Vakulinchuk makes a decision .
Fire !
Brothers !
Who are you shooting at ?
The guns were shaking .
Shoot !
Shoot !
Shoot you rags !
To the guns , comrades !
Beat the dragons !
Beat them !
Beat everyone !
Fear God !
Shave yourself off , Chaldeans !
Down with it for the worms to eat !
Comrades !
The victory is ours !
Bleeding to death , Vakulinchuk tries to escape from the furious Gilyarovsky .
Vakulinchuk overboard !
Save Vakulinchuk !
The first to call for rebellion was thus the first to fall at the hands of executioners .
To the shore .
Odessa .
A tent on the New Pier of Odessa - Vakulinchuk &apos;s last port .
ABOUT A LONG BORSCHTSCH
Act Three &quot; THE DEAD CALLS &quot;
From the night came the fog ...
Rumours came from the pier .
And with the sun came the news into the city .
An armored cruiser on the road uprising shore ...
A murdered sailor ...
Always remember that .
Around a spoonful of borscht .
&quot; Citizens of Odessa !
In front of you lies the corpse of the sailor Vakulinchuk , brutally murdered by the First Officer of the armoured cruiser &quot; Prince of Taurien . &quot; Revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires !
Death to the oppressors !
The crew of the armored cruiser &quot; Prince of Tauria . &quot;
Eternal remembrance to the fallen combatants !

One for all .
Down with the executioners !
Down with autocracy !
Mothers and brothers !
No difference , no enmity shall separate us !
Beat the Jews !
Shoulder to shoulder .
The Earth - is ours
Tomorrow - is our
A delegate from the shore .
The enemy must be hit decisively !
In league with the insurgent workers of all Russia
we will win !
The Potemkin River watches the shore intently and attentively .
Fourth Act &quot; THE STEP OF ODESSA &quot;
In those days the whole city was at one with the insurgent armored cruiser .
Like a white swarm the boats flew towards the armored cruiser .


Let us ask them .
Listen !
Don &apos;t shoot !
My boy is doing very badly
Cossacks !
Then the shells of the armored cruiser respond to the atrocities of the military rulers in Odessa .
Destination - the Theatre of Odessa .
On the General Staff .
Act Five &quot; Encounter with the Diviner &quot;
Stormy meetings lasted till evening .
Odessa &apos;s people await their liberators !
Go ashore and the troops will join you .
Landing is impossible .
The Admiral Squadron is moving against us .
They unanimously decided to meet the squadron .
A night of unrest broke out .
The squadron crept up in the dark .
Hoarse from constant speeches throats breathe heavy and faltering .
Squadron on the horizon !
All man on deck !
Clear for battle
Full steam ahead !
Brave !
Extreme power ahead !
The Potemkin and Minecraft 267 .
The Admiral is attacking !
The squadron is approaching !
Give a signal : Join us !
Join us !
Enemy at gunpoint !

One against one .
Fire ? Or ...
Brothers !
The fraternal hooray roared over the heads of the tsarist admirals .
The red flag of freedom flew proudly . Without a single shot , the insurgent armored cruiser passed through the ranks of the squadron .
Alaska &apos;s gold rush was a dream for the hard @-@ boiled . The siren of the north called many to her icy chest and unexplored lands .
The gold mines were located behind the Chilkoot Pass .
Here unimagined misery unfolded .
Many fell down exhausted and died , others turned back , the strongest held out .
In the icy north , in the quiet nothingness came a fearless , lonely gold prospector .
Somewhere in this nothingness was another gold prospector .
Carefree , our Columbus trudged into the barren wasteland , then he stopped , stumbled and slid .
&apos;Wait a minute , I &apos;ve got to get there before I know where I am . &apos;
In the ice desert was a dream . A cry penetrated into the dreary sky .
&apos;Heureka !
I &apos;ve found a pile of gold ! &apos;
But the elements laughed , roared and thundered !
In a lonely hut lived equally lonely Black Larson , a miserable , predatory villain .
The little guy stumbled into the groaning shed in search of shelter and hospitality .
He stretched his weary bones as icy wind whistled through the holes .
&quot; Come here , &quot; Larson said .
&quot; What are you doing there ? &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m eating , as you can see . &apos;
&quot; Get out with you ! &quot;
&apos;Come on ! &apos;
Get Me Out Of Here !
The storm also battered Big Jim .
Jim was the noble guy , he had suffered .
Oh , he loved to suffer !
He suffered from everything .
&quot; Get out ! &quot; said Larson .
&apos;Otherwise it &apos;s lead . &apos;
&quot; Go now , get out you two ! &quot;
Get Me Out Of Here !
But Big Jim couldn &apos;t stand the noise .
&apos;I &apos;m staying here , right ? &apos;
&quot; Here ! &quot; said Big Jim .
&quot; Yes , Mister , he &apos;s staying here , &quot; said the chap .
&quot; Is that clear ?
We &apos;re both staying here . &apos;
They stayed for days while the hut groaned .
And the men ran until they were tormented by hunger .
&quot; I need to eat ! &quot; screamed Big Jim .
&apos;I &apos;ve got to eat ! &apos;
&quot; What do you eat ? &quot;
&apos;Nothing . &apos;
&quot; Shut up ! &quot;
&quot; Liar , you eat the candle . &quot;
&quot; Which ? &quot; said the chap .
&apos;How disgusting . &apos;
&quot; If you taunt me , I &apos;ll slit you open . &quot;
&quot; One of us has to go into the storm if we want to eat . &quot;
&apos;Come here , &apos; he said .
&quot; We draw cards . The loser must go . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s your turn , &quot; Jim said .
&quot; Bye , good luck !
Bring something to snack on . &quot;
Somewhere in the middle of nowhere , justice was looking for Black Larson .
Hunger still plagued her on Thanksgiving Day .
But they had a reason to be grateful .
&quot; Not quite yet . Two minutes ! &quot;
&quot; Come on , get on with it ! &quot;
The little guy searched everything , but did not find the smallest bite , not even a field mouse .
The agonising hunger drove Big Jim to bouts of hysteria .
He was a nervous wreck .
&quot; Eat , eat ! &quot; he thundered .
&quot; Another shoe roast ? &quot;
&quot; No ! Everything , except that ! &quot;
Poor Jim couldn &apos;t stand it any more .
&apos;What &apos;s going on ? &apos;
&quot; I thought you were a chicken . &quot;
&quot; Give us a break . &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
&quot; Come here , little bird . &quot;
&apos;Don &apos;t be childish . &apos;
&apos;Don &apos;t be silly , it &apos;s me ! &apos;
&quot; You ! &quot; said Big Jim .
&apos;I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m spinning . &apos;
&quot; Who are you telling ? &quot; the guy asked .
&quot; I &apos;ll take the shotgun before you lose it . &quot;
Chicken or not , the chap whetted Big Jim &apos;s appetite .
Meanwhile , Black Larson came across Big Jim &apos;s gold mine .
Then everyone went their own way .
Jim to his mine , our hero in his destiny .
&apos;Do it well .
I &apos;m so happy . &apos;
Fraud awaited Big Jim on his gold mine .
Big Jim looked Larson deep into his eyes and saw the soul of a villain .
The maelstrom of his misdeeds dragged Black Larson down into deserved calamity .
As in a dream , a city was born in the wilderness .
People filled it with life , love and lust .
Georgia !
Jack was a womanizer .
Georgia was impulsive , proud and independent .
She worked in a dance studio .
Jack had a lot left for her .
That was exactly what she resented .
From the night the little guy came into the light of pleasure , into the refuge of lost dreams .
&apos;Just be nice to Jack .
I think he really likes you . &quot;
&apos;He likes everyone , &apos; Georgia said aloud .
&apos;That &apos;s all that bothers me here .
I &apos;d give anything up for a decent guy ! &apos;
&quot; One day I will find him . &quot;
She turned and searched and searched ... and searched .
&quot; Pretty cheeky , &quot; Jack thought .
&apos;Don &apos;t pretend like that .
We &apos;re dancing now . &apos;
&quot; Play something nice . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; We &apos;re dancing . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; Georgia said .
To embarrass Jack , she picked out the pathetic Tramp .
&quot; Hey , you ! Come here . &quot;
Yes , you .
Do you wanna dance ? &quot;
&apos;You see , I don &apos;t dance with everyone . &apos;
Undaunted , the brave gentleman guarded her sanctuary .
&quot; If you want to catch them , put your hat on properly .
&quot; Here , put that in ! &quot;
&apos;So , &apos; he said .
I &apos;m stronger than I thought . &apos;
Hank Curtis &apos; cottage was not far away .
Hank was a lone engineer who occasionally went on expedition .
He was a good person , our hero was hungry , the beans smelled and the coffee steamed .
He found a way to be invited .
Big Jim recovered from Larson &apos;s blow but lost his memory .
Hanks &apos; partner arrives .
A long expedition awaits them .
The guy is supposed to guard Hanks &apos; cabin in time .
&apos;Don &apos;t forget to feed the mule . &apos;
Georgia had not seen the chap again , but chance brought them together .
When she entered , the whole room shone , the music of romance filled his untrained soul .
When she introduced the group , his heart hummed .
They warmed up , he went to get wood .
That &apos;s when his secret was discovered : He loved Georgia .
The women giggled to hide their pity .
In her world it was not advisable to show much heart .
They would rather take him up .
They squatted in the twilight , their faces sparkling cheekily , but his naive heart kept humming .
She was partying , flirting and petting .
He knew she was joking , but he enjoyed her holding his hand and smiling at him .
&apos;It &apos;s nice to have it here .
I hope we &apos;ll be able to come back . &apos;
What was that ?
He enjoyed her human warmth and the lady the warmth of his chair .
Then she left .
And with her , her charms .
He was left with nothing but emptiness and his dreary , lonely existence .
&quot; Sorry , but uh ... &quot; He lacked words .
&quot; Are you serious ? &quot;
&apos;But of course .
What do you think , girls ? &quot;
&apos;We &apos;re coming to New Year &apos;s Eve . &apos;
&apos;Come on , we &apos;re going to celebrate New Year &apos;s Eve . &apos;
Of course she had to forget her gloves !
He then pulled out all the stops to celebrate New Year &apos;s Eve .
New Year &apos;s Eve - new hopes , new dreams !
Georgia delighted him with her tender smile .
The girls demanded a speech .
He was too happy for that .
The only thing that mattered was Georgia .
He stuttered and finally said :
&quot; Instead of a speech , I want to dance . &quot;
And so it came to the bun dance .
If old friends are forgotten
And never to be remembered
If old friends are forgotten
From bygone times
For the sake of the old times , My dear ones
For the sake of the old times ,
At the party , it dawned on Georgia that she had promised something .
&quot; Come on , let &apos;s visit the guy . &quot;
&apos;It &apos;s going to be fun .
It &apos;s going to scare him . &apos;
&apos;Forget it .
You &apos;d better take care of me . &apos;
Shortly afterwards , Big Jim tried to convince the authorities that he had discovered gold .
&quot; Where is it supposed to be ? &quot;
Unfortunately , Big Jim had forgotten that .
He just knew it was at the cottage .
&quot; The hut , exactly !
&quot; When I get to the hut , I find the mine .
But I &apos;ve forgotten . &apos;
&quot; Your girlfriend Georgia is looking for you . &quot;
How dare this scoundrel mention them so lightly ?
Ripe for blows again !
But since he was underweight , he overlooked the insult .
Georgia had actually searched for him and written to him .
While he was looking for Georgia , Big Jim was looking for him .
&quot; You there ! &quot; cried Big Jim .
&quot; Exactly the man I am looking for !
The hut !
Where is she ?
&quot; Answer , go on !
&quot; Can you speak ?
Tell me !
&quot; Where is the cottage ?
Where ?
&apos;I &apos;m going to find my gold mine .
&quot; Get on your feet , fast !
&apos;You &apos;re coming along .
Take me to the hut and I &apos;ll make you a millionaire . &apos;
Georgia !
One moment , &quot; the chap said .
&apos;You don &apos;t need to explain anything .
&apos;I &apos;m going to save you .
&apos;As soon as I &apos;m back , I &apos;ll be back . &apos;
Exhausted they reached the hut .
&apos;The worst &apos;s over .
&quot; Get the provisions . Tomorrow we will look for the mine .
Take a sip .
It &apos;s going to cheer you up . &apos;
&quot; Pretty heavy , that lamb chop ! &quot;
As usual , fate mixed in . The elements laughed , roared and thundered , but our heroes slumbered deeply .
Then the morning dawned ...
The guy woke up . He had forgotten the night and yet he knew it was &quot; the morning after . &quot;
&quot; First clean up and make breakfast . &quot;
&quot; I have never had liver problems like this ! &quot;
&quot; Do you feel the swing ? &quot;
&apos;That &apos;s the stomach . &apos;
&apos;That &apos;s not the stomach . &apos;
&apos;Let &apos;s go over .
Let &apos;s see how far it tilts . &apos;
&quot; Something seems to be missing below . &quot;
&apos;I &apos;ll see how it goes . &apos;
&apos;Just don &apos;t get upset .
Quiet . Don &apos;t move , don &apos;t breathe ! &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; Don &apos;t breathe , wooden head ! &quot;
&quot; Sometimes you can drive you to whiteness . &quot;
&quot; If you just keep calm , everything will be fine . &quot;
&apos;Evidence of character .
Where is your will ? &quot;
&quot; Listen . &quot; I have an idea .
That &apos;s how I can get out first . &apos;
&quot; Do you understand now ?
&apos;You &apos;ve got no idea about psychology , no self @-@ control . &apos;
That &apos;s when Big Jim came across his gold mine .
&apos;Now we &apos;re rich .
We &apos;re going to be millionaires ! &apos;
And so it was .
They wanted to go home , away from the inhospitable Alaska and to the land of Cockaigne :
Live , laugh and indulge in luxury !
They were famous , the press corrupted them .
In their luxury cabin , they were courted even more .
The guy should tell his life :
&quot; From rags to riches . &quot; He said yes .
Jim had a manicure .
&quot; Not the nails , the calluses ! &quot;
The reporters wanted a photo in the old rags .
For the sake of humanity .
Georgia !
There she was - and no one knew anything about the other .
Georgia heard about a blind passenger .
&quot; She , &quot; she said .
&apos;I never thought I &apos;d do that . &apos;
She thought he was the wanted man .
They wanted him booked .
But Georgia was willing to pay for him .
&apos;He &apos;s a blind passenger ?
That &apos;s Big Jim &apos;s mate , the millionaire ! &apos;
Of course they apologised .
The guy gathered and let the butler take care of the new guest .
&quot; Sorry , but who is the lady ? &quot;
&apos;What you don &apos;t say ...
Congratulations !
A great story - with a happy ending ! &quot;
And that was it :
a happy ending .

Refuge of the song lovers ,
The Paris Opera House rises nobly above medieval torture chambers , hidden dungeons , long forgotten .
Melody floats through corridors and corridors , even to the offices of the directors , where an extraordinary contract is concluded .
Now the seal of the notary , gentlemen , and you are the happy new owners .
It is hardly possible that you can hear a ghost , a phantom of opera !
The servants of Lodge Five will not laugh if you are exploring the spirit of opera !
They are heavier , gentlemen !
We are not children !
Who occupies Lodge Five ?
I don &apos;t know .
I have only seen the veiled figure of a man who hides his face and refuses to speak !
Is it the Phantom ?
The Phantom !
The Phantom is back up from the cellars !
We saw him for a moment ... a grey shadow ... and he was gone !
He didn &apos;t have a nose !
Yes , he had , she was huge !
This man came out of the basements ... shortly after we saw the phantom .
Could it be that he ... ?
Joseph Buquet has really seen the Phantom !
Let &apos;s ask him ...
His eyes are horrible pearls in which there is no light ... like holes in a grinning skull !
His face is like leprosy parchment , yellow skin tightly stretched over protruding bones !
His nose ... there is no nose !
Watch out , Buquet ... ghosts don &apos;t like to be seen or mentioned !
Come on , I &apos;ll show you where I saw him ... in the backdrop of the third cellar .
I saw him there !
A flash of shadow , and he was gone !
My daughter , Carlotta was offended !
You , the favourite prima donna of the Paris Opera !
Mademoiselle Carlotta
Christine will sing the role of Marguerite on Wednesday night !
Any jealous attempt on your part to disrupt the screening will prove disastrous for your career .
The Phantom
&quot; No ghost will scare Carlotta !
You &apos;ll hear them sing on Wednesday night ! &apos;
Wednesday night &apos;s find was Mademoiselle
Carlotta gets up strangely ill and Christine Daaé sings &quot; Marguerite . &quot;
&quot; What do I hear that Christine prefers a mysterious admirer to yours , Raoul ? &quot;
&quot; Do not worry , my dear brother - nothing shall disturb our love . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve heard a lot of rumours , Raoul - be careful ! &quot;
&quot; At least you have fulfilled your dream , darling , and now we should be married . &quot;
&quot; I can never leave the opera , Raoul .
You &apos;ve got to forget our love . &apos;
From a hidden place behind the walls , a melodic voice , like the voice of an angel , speaks to her .
&quot; Christine , tonight I put the world at your feet ! &quot;
&quot; I have lent you the full extent of my art .
You will be victorious - all of Paris will revere you ! &quot;
&quot; But I warn you , you must forget all worldly things and think only of your career - and your master ! &quot;
&quot; Soon , Christine , this spirit will take shape and demand your love ! &quot;
&quot; Call me when you want .
I &apos;ll wait . &apos;
In Mlle Carlotta &apos;s correspondence another letter appeared , bordered in black !
Mlle Carlotta If you turn up tomorrow evening , you have to be prepared for a great misfortune , and that is why I recommend you to be &quot; sick . &quot;
&quot; Christine Daae &apos;s friends are conspiring again !
But let my daughter sing tomorrow night , come what may ! &quot;
My dear directors -The role of &quot; Marguerite &quot; will be sung again tomorrow evening by Christine Daae instead of Carlotta
P.S. If you refuse , you will show Faust in a cursed house .
Encouraged by her mother , Carlotta defied every warning and appeared the following evening as - &quot; Marguerite . &quot;
&quot; So far , so good - for a cursed house ! &quot;
I cannot explain it , but you must never intend to see me again .


She &apos;s singing to bring down the chandelier ! &apos;
&quot; Christine , I came to pick you up &quot;
&quot; I am ready , Master - waiting ! &quot;
&quot; Run to your mirror , my love - don &apos;t be afraid ! &quot;
&quot; Christine , it &apos;s me - your master ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t look under my mask - think rather of my affection that the gift of the song has brought you . &quot;
A dark lake , hidden from humanity and the sun , leads to the rendezvous of the phantom .
&quot; I brought you here - - five cellars under the ground - &quot;
&quot; - because I love you ! &quot;
&apos;I &apos;ve been waiting for this hour for months ! &apos;
&quot; So what is good in me , provoked by your purity , could ask for your love . &quot;
&apos;That &apos;s where I sleep . &apos;
&quot; It constantly reminds me of that other dreamless sleep that cures all illnesses - forever ! &quot;

- You are the Phantom ! &quot;
&quot; If I am the Phantom , it is because hatred of mankind has made me the Phantom . &quot;
&quot; If I should be saved , it will be because your love redeems me . &quot;
&quot; People once knew me as Erik , but for many years I lived in these cellars , an unnamed legend . &quot;
Another phantom tragedy
Christine Daae
Opera singer mysteriously disappears after chandelier disaster
The night passed - a night of vague horror - tormented dreams -

My dear Christine you are in no danger as long as you do not touch my mask .
You will be free if your love for the spirit of Eric overcomes your anguish . Erik
Don Juan triumphant
&quot; Ever since I first saw your face , this music has been singing to me about you and - triumphant love ! &quot;
&quot; But listen -- there &apos;s an ominous undertone of warning ! &quot;
&quot; Delight your eyes - overwhelm your soul with my cursed ugliness ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , angry Christine , who wouldn &apos;t listen to my warning ! &quot;
&quot; If you love me , as you say , then let me go .
I promise to be your slave forever ! &quot;
I will show you the depth of my love .
You may return to your world for now .
You can sing at the opera again . &quot;
&quot; But , remember , you are mine - mine - and you shall not see your lover again !
If you do it , it &apos;s death for both of you ! &apos;
&quot; Oh , I swear , I swear !
I &apos;ll never see him again ! &apos;
Although I gave my word never to see you again , I must .
I &apos;ll be at Bal Masque tomorrow night , but be careful not to be alone ! &apos;
Every year , in one night , the whole of Paris mingled , regardless of state -- at the merry , foolish Bal Masque de l &apos;Opera .
In the midst of the festivities , a ghostly figure walked , dressed in red .
&quot; Under your dancing feet are the graves of tortured men - so the Red Death punishes your merriment ! &quot;
High above Paris on the roof of the Opera !
Are we alone , Raoul ?
Can anyone hear what we are saying ?
I saw him , Raoul !
I &apos;ve seen the Phantom !
He &apos;s a monster - a disgusting beast !
You must save me from him , Raoul !
Mlle Carlotta will never sing again under the spell of his curse .
Tomorrow I will take her place in Faust .
After the performance you have to take me away ! &quot;
I &apos;ll be at the stage door .
We will flee to England .
She cheated on me !
Not this way - this way !
That was the operatic spirit !
-ERIK-Born during the tabloid massacre autodictatorial musician and master of black art
Suspended on Devil &apos;s Island for the criminally insane
FLIGHT NOW ON FREE FEET
This is your man .
Monsieur le Prefet
- The Phantom of the Opera ! &quot;
At nine o &apos;clock the following evening , a mysterious carriage stopped on the round side of the Opera House .
Wait for me at the west gate .
I heard his voice again , Raoul .
He knows our plan - everything . &quot;
Believe in my love , Raoul .
Save me from this monster - oh , save me !
My carriage is waiting outside .
We must leave immediately after the screening !
Dry your tears , sweetheart , and hurry -- you have to get ready for the performance !
Come on fast !
Again the work of the strangler !
It was there !
I saw the body dangling in the air !
My brother -- poor Joseph , he knew too much about the phantom !
The Punchbowl Lasso - the strangler &apos;s rope !
Murderers !
Hide in the deepest shadows
- but I will get to the bottom of you !
Fear for his brother &apos;s safety brought Comte de Chagny to the Opera House that night .
I think I can take you to Christine Daae
- if you act exactly as I tell you .
Who are you to know the secrets of the phantom - and reveal them ?
I am Ledoux of the secret police .
I &apos;ve been studying the phantom for months .
I found his hiding place deep in the torture chambers where he himself was imprisoned during the second revolution .
Keep your hands up - the strangler &apos;s noose winds up quickly !
Your hands up - it &apos;s about life and death
The discovery of this trapdoor cost Joseph Buquet his life .
m a messenger from the shadows
- turn back before you perish !
You lied to me !
Do you think you and your lover can cheat the phantom ?
Ungrateful fool !
You spurned the spirit that animated you
- the spirit that made you great !
Now you will see the evil spirit that constitutes my evil face !
No longer will I secrete the poison of hatred like a toad in these rotten cellars , for you will bring me love !
We should be in his hiding place now .
We have fallen in the room of many mirrors the old torture chamber !
I am a man like other men I am not cheated of my happiness !
Raoul !
Raoul !
My brother - where are you ?
It seems like we have visitors .
Christine !
Christine !
Can you hear me ?
Your voice sounds close .
Try to find a door that leads to us .
Look over you - try to find out where he keeps his keys .
The visitors have left .
I have discovered the hiding place of the phantom
- tonight my brother will be avenged !
Have you heard voices ?
Maybe we will have more visitors .
Heat - unbearable heat !
Fools - do they think their brains have grown ?
What do you offer for their lives ?
Your answer . Quick - they can only survive a few moments !
Gunpowder !
You have your chance to save him .
Will you be Eric &apos;s bride , or do you prefer to see your lover die ?
If you turn the scorpion - you said &quot; yes &quot; and spared de Chagny .
Turn the grasshopper - and the opera house explodes into a thousand pieces !
I will do everything you say , if only you could save them !

CHILDREN FACE
Saint @-@ Luc , a village in the Upper Valais .
The house of the village chief .
On this spring morning , all those who are not hindered by hard work have come because the house has been struck by misfortune .
The village head : Pierre Amsler . ( Victor VINA )
His son Jean . ( Jean FOREST )
His daughter Pierrette . ( Pierrette HOUYEZ )
A neighbor . ( Jeanne MARIE-LAURENT )
The mother of the two children .
&apos;Where &apos;s Mum ? &apos;
<unk> &apos;s going on a journey . &apos;
&apos;It &apos;s just a shock , nothing serious .
A few days rest and he &apos;s back on the mound . &apos;
Canon Taillier , the pastor of Vissoy , was Jean &apos;s godfather . ( Henri DUVAL )
And for Amsler , normal life went more badly than well .
It pained him to see children and the house so neglected .
... &quot; and that torn sleeve ... &quot;
Every evening Jean sent a thought to his mother .
When he looked attentively at her picture , it seemed to him that it was alive and smiled at him .
Like every Sunday .
It was St Martin &apos;s Day , payday for the leasehold .
Her daughter Arlette . ( Arlette PEYRAN )
&apos;I can &apos;t pay . &apos;
&apos;My husband &apos;s fatal accident was supposedly his own fault so the insurance company paid nothing . &apos;
And spring came again .
Amsler often passed Jeanne Dutois &quot; field .
The first Sunday in June .
&quot; Jean , my little one , I have something to do .
Go you alone . &quot;
&apos;If you want , we can be married before St John &apos;s Day . &apos;
&quot; I am staying for a few days with my old friend , Father Porchet .
How are the children doing ? &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m going to get married again . &apos;
&apos;My house is empty and no one &apos;s looking after little Pierrette .
It &apos;s better for the kids . &apos;
&apos;And Jean ...
Did you tell him about it ? &quot;
&apos;No , not yet , &apos; he said .
&apos;He &apos;s so sensitive .
I think you &apos;ve got to prepare him very carefully for that . &apos;
The following day .
&apos;You &apos;ve got something to talk about , I &apos;m leaving . &apos;
&quot; And ? &quot;
&apos;Couldn &apos;t you talk to Jean ?
I think you could explain everything much better to him .
He &apos;s a good boy but so sensitive ... &apos;
&quot; I have an idea !
I &apos;ll take him to Vissoy for a couple of weeks and teach him to be careful . &apos;
&apos;When he comes back , things have already taken their course and he &apos;ll get used to the new situation without too much pain . &apos;
At dawn the priest took his godchild with him .
When they had climbed the pass , they descended into the next valley .
At nightfall the steeple of Vissoy came into view .
No sooner had the hay been brought in than the village chief celebrated his wedding .
&quot; Something changes for you , Jean .
Your father &apos;s going to get married again . &apos;
&quot; My little one , you must also think of those you love . &quot;
&quot; Do you want your sister Pierrette to be poorly brought up and for your dad to live sad and alone forever ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to say &apos; Mama &apos; to her ? &quot;
&apos;Well ... you could call her &apos; Mother &apos; .
At the end of the month ...
With a heavy heart , but full of good intentions , Jean returned to his childhood home .
Everything seemed to him as if he had been away for years .
Even before he entered the house , it seemed to him changed .
&quot; What do I want ?
Enter my home to thunder ! &quot;
&apos;Mum &apos;s banned me from letting anyone in . &apos;
&apos;But I &apos;m Jean , I live here ! &apos;
&quot; Who allowed you to use my crayons ? &quot;
&apos;Mom . &apos;
&apos;That &apos;s where Pierrette and I sleep .
You &apos;re now sleeping in the small room at the end of the corridor . &apos;
&apos;You &apos;ve got to listen to me because I &apos;m your mum now .
Then I &apos;ll love you and you &apos;re my little boy . &apos;
&apos;And you &apos;ve got to be cheerful .
I don &apos;t like sad , dreamy kids , they &apos;re lazy . &apos;
&quot; Yes , Madame . &quot;
By afternoon bread .
... &quot; do not quarrel , but love and support each other . &quot;
The following Sunday .
Jean has just recognised his mother &apos;s brooch .
&quot; What have you got ? &quot;
The hostility between the children soon became apparent .
Pierrette and Jean always played on &quot; their island , &quot; far from Arlette , who could not get to them .
&quot; Where &apos;s your hat ? &quot;
One day the attic was cleaned up .
&quot; The fabric is still good , that &apos;s enough for a dress for each of you . &quot;
&apos;It &apos;s not yours , it &apos;s my mum &apos;s ! &apos;
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot;
&quot; Answer ! &quot;
&quot; Answer with pleasure ! &quot;
&apos;I hate them !
I hate them !
I hate them ! &apos;
After a few months , Jean and Arlette hated each other .
My doll !
I &apos;ve lost my doll ! &apos;
&apos;Now it &apos;s too late to find them . &apos;
In the evening .
&quot; Ridiculous to cry for a lost doll at your age ! &quot;
&quot; Go up , I will come to you in a moment . &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m sure the doll fell down near the bridge . &apos;
&apos;It &apos;s not far away .
Just go , I &apos;ll open the door for you . &apos;
Jean had only wanted Arlette to get in trouble .
Now he began to sense the extent of his deed .
Stray .
&quot; Do you hear the avalanche ? &quot;

Confess all on the spot .
&quot; Are you sick ? &quot;
&apos;I &apos;d like to talk to Dad . &apos;
&quot; Go home and pray . &quot;
Tormented by fear and guilt , he turned to the image of his mother , but it seemed distant and obliterated .
Even the portrait failed him .
The next morning .
His father had not accused him of anything .
Jean thought he was scum from now on in the eyes of his family .
He assumed he was a criminal .
&quot; Dear Dad . Goodbye .
I &apos;m a rogue .
I hope you will forgive me .
I &apos;ll give you a hug , Jean . &apos;
&apos;I &apos;m going to go away forever . &apos;
&quot; Since you forgive me , would you hug me ? &quot;
&apos;Mom . &apos;

THE IMAGINARY JOURNEY by Renè Clair ( 1925 )
One summer morning in a small town in the country .
A poor and shy man on his way to work in a bank .
Auguste , a worker .
Albert , another employee .
Lucie , a typist .
The bank manager .
Rosa Koslex , &quot; authorised &quot; hand reader .
&quot; I see three men you love ! &quot;
&apos;You &apos;re going to marry the man you love ! &apos;
&quot; You will marry the woman you love ! &quot;
&quot; A beautiful future ! &quot;
This afternoon ...
&quot; Jean , don &apos;t get upset with me ! &quot;
&apos;I don &apos;t love Albert . &apos;
My dear Jean , it &apos;s you I love .
Here &apos;s your engagement ring .
Your Lucie .
&quot; Thanks to your kiss I have regained my strength .
Look ... &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m a fairy !
A hundred years ago , a sorcerer stole my powers .
Only the kiss of a young man could restore them ... &quot;
&quot; Follow me : You shall be rewarded ! &quot;
&quot; We are in the hospice for old fairies . &quot;
&apos;Nowadays , no one believes in fairies any more .
So , my old sisters have locked themselves in this cave . &quot;
&quot; They want you to kiss them ... all of them ! &quot;
&quot; Step back ! &quot;
This is Sylvaine , an evil fairy .
Watch out , she &apos;s really bad !
&quot; These are your old friends , The Puss in Boots ... &quot;
&quot; Bluebeard ... &quot;

Cinderella and the Prince ... &quot;
&quot; Be glad , the fairies give you immortality .
You will live with us forever ! &quot;
&apos;I don &apos;t want to live forever if Lucie isn &apos;t with me ! &apos;
&quot; Since you cannot be without them , we should bring them here ! &quot;
&quot; Look , here &apos;s your fiancée ! &quot;
&quot; I wanted your friends to be here too ! &quot;
A fascinating life begins .
Thanks to these two lovers , an atmosphere of tenderness permeated the ancient cave of the fairies .
&apos;Evil Silvayne &apos;s jealous of Lucie .
I fear their power .
Lucie &apos;s got to go . &apos;
&quot; Take this as a souvenir .
With this ring you just have to ... make a wish and it will come true ! &quot;
&quot; If I accept to leave the girl to you , you must solemnly promise something that will ensure her happiness ! &quot;
&quot; Repeat : with all my heart I want to be like a faithful dog to Lucie &quot;
A dog !
&apos;We &apos;ve done it !
His oath has transformed him .
Suddenly he became a dog ! &quot;
But where is Jean ? DO NOT ALLOW DOGS
&quot; Jean said we would meet here . &quot;
For the thief , the ring has lost its magical power .
&apos;Don &apos;t wait for Jean .
That damn ring turned him into a dog !
He &apos;s in your hand ! &apos;
&quot; Jean , is that you ? &quot;
At midnight ...
Through the power of imagination , with a normal ring , Jean has regained his self @-@ confidence .

A German folk tale
See :
&quot; Open the gates of darkness , and the terrors of the peoples shall run over the earth ... &quot;
Back !
Stop !
Why do you scourge humanity with war , plague , famine ?

&quot; The earth is mine ! &quot;
&quot; The earth will never be yours !
Man is good : his spirit strives for truth ! &quot;
&quot; Look down there ! &quot;
&quot; Wonderful are all things of heaven and earth !
But the greatest miracle ... is the freedom of man : to choose between good and evil ! &quot;
&quot; Did you see Faust ? &quot;
&quot; A prankster like all !
He teaches good and he drives evil !
He will create gold and the stone of the wise .
Look at his greed ! &quot;
&quot; What is the bet :
I &apos;m wresting God &apos;s soul ! &apos;
&quot; Can you destroy the Divine in Faust : Yours be the Earth ! &quot;
&quot; No man resists evil !
The betting &apos;s on ! &apos;
&quot; The plague ! ...
The plague ! &quot;
Terribly , the plague spread :
In a few days half the city lay dying !
Day and night Faust wrestled with God in prayer to find a cure for the plague .
And there was a cry throughout Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
&quot; Bless the work of salvation Lord my God , only You can help in this iammer ! &quot;
&quot; Help ... Help !
My mother &apos;s dying ! &apos;
Death fear and frenzy filled the city ...
&quot; Repent , fast and pray !
Faith only conquers death ! &quot;
&quot; Be in awe of death ! &quot;
&apos;We don &apos;t know when it will hit us !
Until then we want to live and enjoy ! &quot;
&quot; Whoever believes will live !
But death will crush the wicked ! &quot;
The plague !
The plague ! &quot;
&quot; Mercy , fist !
Only you can save us ! &quot;
&quot; Let go of me !
We are lost !
Faith does not help , knowledge does not help !
Everything is a lie ... &quot;
But thou , O God , art merciful unto us of great goodness ,
The Triple Mighty Key to the Force of the Hell Spirits
And if you want the Lord of darkness to help you and give you all the power and glory of the world , go to a crossroads and call upon Him three times ...
&quot; I call upon You for help , Spirit of Darkness ! Appear ! &quot;
&quot; Appear , demon of evil ! &quot;
&quot; As you call yourself with your hellish name :
MEPHISTO Appears ! &quot;
&quot; You called me ! &quot;
&apos;That &apos;s where I am ! &apos;
I unleash God and His heavenly hosts
&quot; Get away from me , Satan ! &quot;
&quot; One day out of this impotence ! &quot;
One day !
Try !
It &apos;s a trial day ! &apos;
&quot; When the glass has filled ... &quot;
... &quot; you are free to reclaim the pact ! Sign ! &quot;

&quot; Can you help the hungry and the sick ? &quot;
&quot; Whatever you desire , I will fulfill it for you : you are the Lord , I am your servant ! &quot;
&quot; A drop of blood ! &quot;
&quot; Blood is a very special juice ! &quot;
&quot; For a day ... ? ! &quot;
&quot; Until the glass is filled ! &quot;
Fist !
Help us ! &quot;
&apos;That &apos;s how I help in the devil &apos;s name ! &apos;
&apos;It &apos;s a miracle .
What a miracle ! &quot;
&quot; I will always pray to the Crucified One for you , if you heal them ! &quot;
&quot; He cannot look at the Holy Cross ! &quot;
&quot; The devil is in covenant with him !
Stone him !
Stone him ! &quot;
&quot; Deliver me , drink of death ! &quot;
&apos;You can &apos;t get away from me !
Remember the pact ! But the day of trial is not over ! &quot;
&quot; Death is free for all men ! &quot;
&quot; Is this death ? &quot;
&quot; It is life , Faust , that punches you in the face with your youth ! &quot;
&quot; Poor fist , why do you seek death : you have not yet lived ! &quot;
&quot; I hate life ! &quot;
&quot; Your life was just book dust and rotten !
Enjoyment is everything ! &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m too old ! &apos;
&quot; I offer you the highest happiness : the youth !
Grab it ! &apos;
&quot; Give me the youth ! &quot;
&quot; We sang to the old man ! &quot;
&quot; To her .... To her ! &quot;
&quot; Steps on my coat ... &quot;
... &quot; And the earth revolves around you ! &quot;
&quot; The wedding of the Duchess of Parma . The most beautiful woman in Italy ! &quot;
&apos;Strange guests ! &apos;
&quot; Adoring the supreme beauty , my Lord brings you the treasures of His kingdoms ! &quot;
&quot; The day of rehearsal is over !
The glass is full !
Be who you were !
&quot; The youth ...
leave me the youth ! &quot;
&quot; Forever fall in love with me ! &quot;
&quot; You tasted life thoroughly , Faust !
From intoxication to intoxication ... an unparalleled tumble ! But nothing satisfies you ! &quot;
&quot; Want a woman a pack of cards , a bacchanal ?
Whatever you wish for , I must fulfil it for you ! &quot;
&quot; Do you want the emperor &apos;s crown ? ! &quot;
&quot; Homeland ! &quot;
&quot; Bring me home !
And right now ! &quot;
&quot; Is there a feast in your city today ? &quot;
&quot; You probably come from the Turkish country , that you do not hear anything about holy Easter ? ! &quot;
&quot; As if life always stands still :
Everything is still as it once was ... ! &quot;
&quot; An innocent ray that runs to the priest ... around the rectory ...
It &apos;s not for you ! &apos;
&quot; Praise the Lord , the mighty King of glory ... &quot;
&quot; Holiday , mother ! &quot;
&quot; I know you here , more pleasing whores ! &quot;
&apos;I just want her !
You do what I command ! &quot;
&quot; Brother Valentine ! &quot;
&quot; Once she has this golden chain in the house , she will already feel the devil &apos;s power ! &quot;
&quot; Potz Blitz , how pretty you are ! &quot;
&quot; What about the suitor ? &quot;
&quot; What have you got , child ? &quot;
&quot; Tell her , mon petit , if you don &apos;t want to tell me ! &quot;
&quot; May I go to Muhme Marthe ? &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Marthe Schwerdtlein . &quot;
&quot; Three drops of this love potion make all women &apos;s hearts after you great ! &quot;
&quot; Look , Muhme Marthe , what I found one of my arks .. ! &quot;
&quot; A rich treasure ! Confess it ! &quot;
&quot; I found in my drawer ! &quot;
&quot; Just let me embrace the beautiful necklace once ! &quot;
&quot; A bouquet for the groom , a wreath for the bride ... &quot;
&quot; Excuse me , beautiful woman , I am looking for Mrs. Marthe Schwerdtlein ! &quot;
&quot; From your cousin from Lombardy ... ! &quot;
&quot; He gave me this necklace as a gift for you ! &quot;
&quot; Whom we close in a row , he shall be our sweetheart ... ! &quot;
&quot; One , two , three , set yourself free ... &quot;
&quot; Forgive me : my stomach is too weak for such a fiery drink ! &quot;
&quot; Allow me to mix myself a little tear , as I learned in Padua ! &quot;
&quot; My friend , a prince of the noblest blood ! &quot;
Love me ...
&quot; Yes , he loves you with all his heart ! &quot;
<unk> &apos;s loving me ....

&quot; I am yours forever ! &quot;
&quot; He loves me ... ! &quot;

The darling shines even on your way ... !
&quot; Damn couplers ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m keeping my brother away , though ! &quot;
&quot; The prettiest girl in town ! &quot;
&quot; There is no girl like your sister :
Gretchen shall live ! &quot;
&quot; A pretty girl is not good ! &quot;
&quot; Gretchen shall live ! &quot;
&quot; Your Gretchen shall live ! &quot;
&quot; Hurry up , you boobies are creeping out of Gretchen &apos;s chamber ! &quot;
&quot; Fort ... away ...

Then : to the pillory with the harlot ! &quot;
&apos;Gretchen ...
Gretchen ... ! &quot;
&quot; The earth and the universe will shake when the dead rise to answer their Lord ... &quot;
&quot; Once the judge has taken his seat , concealment will no longer be pious ... &quot;
&quot; Everything must come to light ! &quot;
Mother ...
Mother ! &apos;
&quot; And gave birth to a child in the middle of cold winter ... &quot;
&quot; Have mercy on my child ! &quot;
&quot; Aren &apos;t you Gretchen , who was pilloried ? ! &quot;
Mercy !
Pity !
My child &apos;s dying ! &apos;

&apos;Fist ...
Fist ... help Gretchen ! &quot;
&quot; Mephisto ! &quot;
&apos;You &apos;ve cheated on me !
She &apos;s suffering ... she &apos;s suffering ! &apos;
&quot; The child murderer the stake ! &quot;
&quot; Save , save Gretchen ! &quot;
&apos;Too late !
They &apos;re already arming your mob ! &apos;
&quot; You are also my servant !
Bring me to her otherwise the pact will be torn up . &quot;
&quot; My black guy is waiting !
Quickly , before the mornings rise ! &quot;
&quot; Faster ...
Faster ! &apos;
&quot; Oh , I would never have wished for the youth that created such Iammer !
Cursed ... cursed is the delusion of youth ! ...
&quot; You cursed the youth yourself !
What you wish for , I must fulfil it for you ! &quot;
&quot; Be who you were : an old man ! &quot;
&quot; Forgive ... forgive me my guilt ! &quot;
&quot; There is no way for you here ! &quot;
&apos;It &apos;s my pact ! &apos;
&quot; One word will destroy your pact ! &quot;
&quot; What is the name of the word ? &quot;
The Word that resounds jubilantly through creation , the Word that satisfies every pain and sorrow , the Word that atones for all human guilt , the eternal Word , You do not know it ? ! &quot;
&quot; What is the name of the word ? &quot;

Gold fever had drawn them to this lonely shore .
Irishman Michael Dennin ( Vladimir Fogel &apos; )
Chairman Hans Nelson , a Swede ( Sergei Komarov )
Nelson &apos;s wife , the Englishwoman Edith ( Aleksandra Chochlova )
The shareholder Dutchy ( Porfirij Podobed )
Shareholder Harkey ( Petr Galadev )
Nothing can be extracted from this mine , we have to look elsewhere .
Go Dennin , pack the instruments , and we &apos;ll move on !
The mine of the joint stock company .
Gold .
Gold .
Luck stayed with the company throughout the winter .
Small house - good luck !
It went on with the gold washing and the gold extraction .
It was me who found the gold , and they &apos;re making me the laundress here .
Gradually spring came .

Dennin is missing , he is not hungry anymore .
Well done , Mr Dennin .
Stop !
Stop !
Stop it ...
He &apos;s alive .
Not without law - this is a white man !
The weather turned abruptly .
One inch per hour .
I &apos;m going to kill you anyway !
He &apos;s dead ...
The two graves are ready , if the Yukon does not flood them ...
In darkness and storms , the two murder victims set off for their icy tombs .
After rain and storms , the icy surface of the Yukon was covered with water .
Day after day passed in debilitating silence .
Man or woman - one of them always sat next to the criminal .
Kill me !
Give me a drink !
The ice broke on the Yukon .
Day .
Night .
Day again .
What are you going to do with me ?
We will deal with you according to the law .
I &apos;m so tired , so tired ...
Tobacco is not enough .
Give me back my tobacco !
Not without law !
Now came Edith &apos;s birthday .
Don &apos;t worry !
Get here !
For you - a birthday present ...
Shave me ...
Shave him !
Today is my birthday !
Why did you do it ?
It seemed so terribly easy to me .
And you always said I would end up on the gallows !
Days passed , but it was not expected that the law would come sooner than in a few weeks .
Let &apos;s pass judgment .
Not today , today is Sunday !
The Queen of England
Edith insisted that the trial be conducted under English law , as the criminal was a subject of the Queen .
Defendant , you are Irish , so we will judge you on behalf of Queen Victoria .



The verdict
Michael Dennin , according to royal law you will be hanged ... and you will hang until you are dead .
Dead ... dead ...
I spoke well .
As with us in court ...
Well , now it &apos;s all over .
It is said that this death does not cause pain ...
The appointed time had come .
Lord have mercy , Lord have mercy , have mercy on us !
If I should have done it for you , Hans , I could not have done it better !
The Execution
May God receive you repentant sinners !
Here - so that it may bring you happiness !

you who eat their raw reindeer meat ... you who drink from the breast of the mother
And you , brave centenarian
you mother who you play with your child
you child you play with the captive Arctic fox
you who stretch out the reindeer
and you who wash the laundry with your feet
and you who sit here in the auditorium
knee @-@ deep in grain
knee deep in the water
to her who spins her flax in the spinning room
you who spin wool in the mountains
you are all the masters of the Soviet earth
The sixth part of the earth is in your hands
From the Kremlin to the Chinese border
From the Strait of Matochkin to Bukhara
From Novorossiysk to Leningrad
From the lighthouse at the Arctic Circle to the mountains of the Caucasus
From the golden eagle on the arm of the Kyrgyz to the eider ducks on the rocks of the Arctic Sea to the owls of the North
Everything is in your

The Buffaloes belong to you
the goats at the river Ulu-Usen
the camels of the Kyrgyz steppe
the reindeer
the Siberian squirrel
the arctic fox in the trap
the marten
the brown bear
the sable found in the far north
the Karakul sheep
Everything is yours




and the sheep
the wool
the wool
the wool

the Fish
Your flax

and your immense wealth ... belongs to you ...
Goods for export roll on all roads of the Soviet Union
via dirt roads
over mountain paths
and with camel caravans
and where the two @-@ wheeled cart buffalo are harnessed
where nomads herd their flocks
where the flocks cross the river
where fruits are packed in boxes
and where the wogule ties the knot with its teeth
where flax is brought to the port for export
GOSTORG ( State Trade Organization )
Where the cisterns and tanks are full of sunflower oil
where the caviar is shipped
the cattle
the cement
where the grain ... flows in an endless stream into foreign cargo ships
and where no way leads
where you cannot meet a single person over a distance of thousands of versts
in severe frost
in the snow drifts of the endless tundra they fight their way to the nearest collection point of the state trade organization so that they can deliver their spoils ... for export to the capitalist countries
Far away at the Arctic Circle where half the year the sun does not set
Every year steamers of the state trade organization with dogs with flour come to them in Novaya Zemlja .
The Samoyeds are guests of the sailors
from the gramophone they hear Lenin himself
After 24 hours the steamer departs again and carries furry animal skins with her
and these skins come to the Leipzig trade fair and in the capitalist country ... the skins , captured by Tungusic , Ostyak , Samoyedic , are exchanged for machines for the Soviet Union for machines that produce machines again
Thus the country builds the proletarian dictatorship and even the peoples who still live in the patriarchy through the expansion of state trade .
together with medium and small farmers who bring their grain to the cooperative together with the farmers who get a tractor through the cooperative for the collective cultivation of the land
together with the workers in the socialist factory
together with the workers in the socialist factory
The Black Sea
The Black Sea
and yours frozen in the sea on the Baltic shore
Ship frozen in the ice
and one who disappears into an icy , unknown distance
here and there they dig the earth with a stick
here and there are still women with veiled faces
Some people still pray the rosary
Some people behave crazy
somewhere the shaman still conjures
there are still places where you can perform a rejuvenation rite for women
there are still places where Menkwa is sacrificed to the god
Slowly the old disappears ... just as you disappear into the icy distance
They still believe in the help of Mohammed
nor believe in the help of Christ
to the help of Buddha
or like the Tungusic ...
I see you
Black Sea and your one frozen in the Baltic Sea
Ship frozen in the ice
and you icebreaker Lenin
You break the ice with your chest
We pave the way ... for our cargo ships to exchange our grain and our furs
for machines that produce machines again so that there is even earlier growth of our own production of machines
I see a woman who has thrown off the veil
Another woman who works among the women of the East
a Samoyeden- Komsomoltsin reading the newspaper Der Nordländer
Buryats and Mongols reading the Buryato @-@ Mongolskaya Pravda
Mongolian children who join a pioneering department
A polar laboratory will be set up to support reindeer herders
Irrigation canals are built by low @-@ water steppes
The electric light bulb comes into the farmhouse
A Reading House
Ostrovsky
- Reading House

and a radio talk
Volkhovstroy
Works even more works
I see that we want to produce ourselves not only Kattun but also the machines we need for the production of Kattun
we want to produce not only tractors but also the machinery to produce the tractors
We are building a complete socialist society in our country
We are a magnet for the workers of the West
a magnet for the peoples of the East who are already rising up to fight against the yoke of capital
oppressed countries that are gradually falling away from world capital
They will flow into the stream of a united socialist economy
into the stream of the united socialist economy

Spring 1861 . The &quot; Western Atlantic Flyer &quot; in full flight to Marietta , Georgia .
There were two great loves in his life .
His locomotive ... and ...
&quot; Fort Sumter has come under fire . &quot;
&quot; Then the war caught up with us . &quot;
&quot; Yes , Father , and I would like to be one of the first to volunteer . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you want to get in touch ? &quot;
&quot; Her name ? &quot;
&quot; Profession ? &quot;
&quot; Train drivers at Western and Atlantic Railway Company . &quot;
Refuse .
As a train driver , he &apos;s more useful to the South . &apos;
&apos;We can &apos;t use you . &apos;
&quot; Profession ? &quot;
&quot; Bartenders &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t blame me if you lose the war . &quot;
&quot; Did Johnnie also come forward ? &quot;
&apos;He didn &apos;t even turn up . &apos;
&apos;He &apos;s a disgrace to the South . &apos;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you come forward ? &quot;
&apos;They didn &apos;t want to take me . &apos;
&apos;Please don &apos;t lie to me ...
I won &apos;t talk to you again until you wear a uniform . &apos;
A year later .
At a Union field camp north of Chattanooga .
General Thatcher and his chief spy , Captain Anderson .
&quot; I know every inch of the railway line from Marietta to Chattanooga . I can &apos;t fail with ten chosen men . &quot;
&apos;We &apos;re pretending to be civilians from neutral Kentucky who want to join the cause of the South . &apos;
&quot; In Big Shanty we steal the train while everyone is eating . Heading north we will burn down all the bridges ... cutting off the enemy army from supplies . &quot;
&quot; On the same day that you steal the train , I let General Parker advance to meet you . &quot;
&quot; As soon as I arrive , I will tell you how badly Father has been wounded . &quot;
Big Shanty .
Twenty minutes for dinner . &quot;
&quot; Three men stole my &quot; General . &quot;
Probably deserters . &quot;
&quot; Why not stop and fight against them ? &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m afraid they &apos;re far outnumbered . &apos;
The Southern Army outside Chattanooga has been ordered to withdraw .
General Parker &apos;s victorious Northern Army advances .
&apos;There &apos;s only one man on this train . &apos;
In enemy territory ... hopelessly lost , helplessly freezing and terribly hungry .
&apos;Tomorrow morning at nine , our utility trains will join General Parker &apos;s Army on the Rock River Bridge . &apos;
&quot; Then the army , supported by our supply , will launch a surprise attack on the left wing of the rebels . &quot;
&apos;Once our troops have crossed that bridge , nothing can stop us . &apos;
&quot; This girl was in the luggage trolley when the train was stolen . I thought it was best to take her with me . &quot;
&apos;We &apos;ll stay here until the morning to see where we are . &apos;
&quot; It was so brave of you to risk your life in enemy territory just to save me . &quot;
After a good , quiet and restful night &apos;s sleep .
&quot; We have to somehow come back to our people to warn them of the impending attack . &quot;
&quot; I get this spy before he reaches the southern lines .
They &apos;re following suit with the supply trains as planned . &apos;
&quot; We need to gather more firewood . &quot;
The Rock River Bridge .
The Northwest Division is approaching to join the trains .
&quot; The bridge is not burning enough to stop you . My men will wade through the river . &quot;
Hero of the day .
&quot; Is that your uniform ? &quot;
&quot; I had to wear them to get through enemy lines . &quot;
&apos;Move out ! &apos;
&quot; Write the Lieutenant . &quot;
&quot; Profession ? &quot;
&quot; Soldier . &quot;
This song about a man and his wife ... plays everywhere and nowhere .
It can be heard in any place , at any time .
For wherever the sun rises and sets , in the hustle and bustle of the city or under the open sky in the countryside , life is the same :
Sometimes bitter , sometimes sweet .
Daylight saving time ...
Among the holidaymakers was a woman from the city .
Several weeks have passed since her arrival , and she still remains .
&quot; They were like children , carefree ... &quot;
always happy and laughing ... &quot;
&apos;Now he &apos;s ruining himself because of this woman .
&apos;Money lenders are looting the farm and his wife &apos;s alone . &apos;
&quot; Tell me , are you all mine ? &quot;
&quot; Sell your farm .
Come to town with me . &quot;
&apos;And my wife ? &apos;
&quot; Could she not be ... drowned ? &quot;
&quot; Capsize the boat and it looks like an accident . &quot;
&quot; Leave it all behind you .
Come with me to the city . &quot;
&quot; Come with me to the city ! &quot;
&quot; When the boat capsized , save yourself with the reed . &quot;
Spread it out on the shore in time and tell everyone she &apos;s drowned . &apos;
&quot; We take a trip over the water .
I &apos;ll be away for a while . &apos;
&quot; Don &apos;t be afraid of me ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be afraid of me ! &quot;
&quot; God entrusts her to you in the holy covenant of marriage . She is young and inexperienced .
Guide and love her . &quot;
&quot; Preserve and protect them from all evil . &quot;
&quot; Will you love them ? &quot;
&quot; &apos; Forgive me ! &quot;
&apos;Manicure ? &apos;
&quot; You look fabulous with polished nails ! &quot;
&quot; Beware of us again ! &quot;
Thank you !
You &apos;ve got to visit us . &apos;
The sweetest bride this year . &quot;
If you want to sell the farm and move to the city ...
&quot; Hit the hole and the piglet slips ! &quot;
&quot; We sail home in the moonlight . &quot;
&apos;I didn &apos;t give up hope .
I know the tides and I looked around . &quot;

The Docks of New York
The waterfront of New York is the terminus of many journeys and the beginning of many adventures .
Miles of docks wait day and night for wicked sailors and their cargo .
Ships arrive and rest for 1 @-@ 2 days from their endless journey from port to port .
These are the days before there was heavy fuel oil and the heaters were still paid for with sweat and coal dust .
&quot; Well , Bill !
We made it with the barge just in time ! &quot;
&quot; Pick up the trash !
Nobody goes ashore until this hole is clean ! &quot;
&apos;We &apos;re leaving tomorrow morning . &apos;
&apos;You &apos;ve got a night on the land .
If you come back drunk , you &apos;ll do a double shift tomorrow ! &apos;
&apos;He &apos;s the biggest choleric I know , really bad ! &apos;
&apos;He probably thinks we &apos;re just going ashore playing groundhogs ! &apos;
The sandbar , only one dew length away from the quay . Also on it the upswing colors .
That night it was fresh and stormy .
Protect his soul and give the money to Harry .
&quot; This is my husband ! &quot;
&apos;Well , Andy !
I bet you weren &apos;t expecting me here ! &apos;
In night and fog the stoker goes ashore .
&quot; Hey , Bill !
This is not a place to fish for a woman ! &quot;
Come on , Bill .
They &apos;re going to take care of her ! &apos;
&apos;Okay , Bill !
Be a hero and leave your comrades behind ! &quot;
&quot; But think of Singapore and remember what happened in Shanghai ! &quot;
&quot; Well , you gave me the gig .
That was 3 years ago , what do you think I should do ? &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s disappear before the police come ! &quot;
&quot; Order her a hot drink ! &quot;
&quot; A hot toddy ! &quot;
&apos;You can &apos;t get in here !
She &apos;s only wearing underwear ! &apos;
&quot; So you &apos;re the guy who saved my life ? &quot;
You could have saved yourself the trouble of reading me die . &quot;
&apos;That &apos;s all right !
Just think you &apos;ve died and just start over again ! &apos;
&quot; You left all the dirt in the river , baby .
All you need is a good time ! &quot;
&apos;I &apos;ve had a lot of great moments . &apos;
&apos;You &apos;ve never gone out with Bill Roberts . &apos;
&quot; Dry yourself off before you catch a cold ! &quot;
&quot; Would you be interested ? &quot;
&quot; Well , I mean ... &quot;
&quot; After a month in a coal bunker , I have no sympathy for anyone who wants to leave this beautiful world like this ! &quot;
&quot; Throw yourself into new clothes and give me a chance ! &quot;
&quot; Well , Bill Roberts , I &apos;ll give you a chance . &quot;
&quot; Anyway , I can make a hole in the water . &quot;
&quot; Do they leave me alone so that I can at least be on my own , or do I have to take a seat far away ? &quot;
&quot; I thought you wanted your tie , Bill . &quot;
&apos;Isn &apos;t she beautiful ? &apos;
&quot; You better listen to my advice and stay away from it ! &quot;
&quot; Go away , boy !
I &apos;m just going to talk to your girlfriend . &apos;
&quot; You may be someone on the ship , but here you are only animal food . &quot;
&quot; Damn , you &apos;re strong ! &quot;
&quot; I bet you knew a lot of women . &quot;
&apos;I don &apos;t brag about my affairs . &apos;
&apos;Me neither . &apos;
&quot; Have you ever been married , Bill ? &quot;
&quot; Who would marry someone like me ? &quot;
&apos;Um .. I don &apos;t know , but some women would do it . &apos;
&quot; Baby , have you ever been married ? &quot;
&quot; Who would marry someone like me ? &quot;
&quot; I sailed the seven seas , but I never saw a ship that was as well cared for as you were . &quot;
&apos;It &apos;s not funny when you rock me like that . &apos;
&quot; Answer me !
Why do you think I &apos;m cheating on you ? &apos;
&quot; What have you ever done worse that makes you worthless than me ?
I &apos;d marry you in a minute ! &apos;
&quot; I will marry you right away ! &quot;
&apos;You don &apos;t know Bill Roberts !
I &apos;d take anyone else ! &apos;
&quot; Bring me a priest , he will reunite me with my girlfriend ! &quot;
&quot; Come back immediately Bill , don &apos;t make yourself a fool ! &quot;
&quot; This is the bride ! &quot;
&apos;I &apos;d better tell Harry before he demolishes the shop ! &apos;
&apos;I &apos;ll do it in front of our Nell !
I &apos;m going to marry her , here and now ! &apos;
&quot; Do you think he can bring you to your senses with marriage ? &quot;
&apos;I don &apos;t know what to think anymore . &apos;
&quot; Until I got married , I was decent ! &quot;
&quot; I will give you a marriage you will never forget ! &quot;
&quot; Where is your certificate ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to spoil the fun just because you need a piece of paper ? &quot;
&apos;Bill &apos;s going to be the first to get it if he really needs it . &apos;
&quot; Isn &apos;t it , Bill ? &quot;
Honourable mention , Parson .
That &apos;s the first thing tomorrow morning ! &apos;
&quot; Let the old man do it !
I &apos;m going to marry you . &apos;
&apos;If one of you has an objection as to why they can &apos;t get married , talk now or keep quiet forever . &apos;
&quot; Does it really mean so much to you ? &quot;
&quot; Beloved , we are gathered here before God and in the presence of the church &quot;
&quot; - to lead this man and this woman into the sacred state of marriage . &quot;
&apos;Marriage is an honourable thing ... but it &apos;s not easy . &apos;
&quot; Will you take this woman to be your wife ? &quot;
&quot; Will you love them , protect them , honor them , in sickness as well as in health , will you renounce all others as long as you both live ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I will ! &quot;
&apos;I &apos;ll . &apos;
&quot; Give me the ring . &quot;
&quot; Here is mine
- I hope he brings you more luck than me ! &quot;
&quot; Here &apos;s yours this year , Parson .
How won , so lost ! &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m expecting them to bring me the certificate tomorrow morning .
Then I &apos;ll give them the money . &apos;
&quot; What is this celebration about ? &quot;
&quot; I thought you were married and wanted to settle down . &quot;
&quot; But how did you get rid of them ? &quot;
&quot; Who said what about getting rid ? &quot;
&quot; I know you , Bill Roberts !
You can cheat on them , but not me ! &quot;
&quot; Which woman threw the shoe ? &quot;
&apos;You don &apos;t know what it means to me , Bill ! &apos;
&apos;I &apos;m going to be a good wife , Bill . &apos;
The next morning .
&quot; Do you have a match , boss ? &quot;
&apos;I guess you can &apos;t remember last night ? &apos;
&quot; Were they never young , boss ?
I &apos;m just having a bit of fun ! &apos;
&apos;I suppose you &apos;ve also forgotten that you &apos;re married . &apos;
&quot; Boss , last night is over .
Today is a new day ! &quot;
&apos;Maybe for you , but not for me .
The brawl will cost you your job ! &quot;
&quot; One ship is as good as the next , boss .
Like any port in a storm ! &quot;
&quot; Disappear or my husband will kill you ! &quot;
&apos;Don &apos;t fool me ! &apos;
&quot; Don &apos;t leave Bill Roberts between us , you know he &apos;ll never come back ! &quot;
&apos;You filthy liar !
He &apos;s coming back ! &apos;
&quot; Get a stretcher fast , the guy is in a bad condition ! &quot;
&apos;You &apos;re not going anywhere , shut up ! &apos;
&quot; I warned you !
Shoot me while you still have time ! &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m her husband . &apos;
<unk> didn &apos;t shoot him .
The baby could not even hurt a fly ! &quot;
&apos;Nobody but me shot him and I &apos;m entitled to that recognition . &apos;
&quot; I am his wife , at least he often made me feel like it . ! &quot;
&apos;Why didn &apos;t you say that before ? &apos;
&apos;I didn &apos;t care before . &apos;
&apos;I hope you &apos;re luckier than me , but I don &apos;t think so . &apos;
&apos;I don &apos;t expect you to come back to help me . &apos;
&apos;Baby you don &apos;t need my help . &apos;
&quot; Are you off , Bill ? &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m sorry baby .
Leaving is in an hour and I &apos;ve never missed a ship in my life . &apos;
&quot; Can you give me another minute to get used to it , Bill ? &quot;
&apos;I &apos;ve never thanked you for pulling me out of the water . &apos;
&apos;It &apos;s okay ! &apos;
&quot; I never thanked you for the beautiful clothes you bought me . &quot;
&apos;No cause . &apos;
&apos;I guess I &apos;m supposed to say thank you for allowing me to be your wife . &apos;
&apos;Listen , baby , you can &apos;t hurt me !
I &apos;ve never done a decent thing in my life . &apos;
&apos;I &apos;ve always been like that .
No force in the world could keep me in the country forever ! &quot;
&quot; Why do you take everything so seriously ?
You knew I &apos;m only on land for one night and I &apos;m just a dirty stoker ! &apos;
&quot; You &apos;re not that bad , Bill Roberts ! &quot;
&apos;It would have been fun , even if it was just a couple of months . &apos;
&apos;If I ever stayed ashore for months , I might even like it , &apos; he said .
Get moving , Bill .
The time is over ! &quot;
&apos;See you then , baby . &apos;
&quot; Well .... do well ...
Bill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Come here at last before you get into new trouble ! &quot;
&apos;I &apos;ll sort that out for you , Bill .
You can &apos;t go out to sea like that . &apos;
&quot; What are you going to do ? Will you bring me more bad luck ? &quot;
&quot; Are you superstitious ? &quot;
&apos;The woman has nerves to cry for after everything I &apos;ve done for her ! &apos;
&apos;Like I said , she wasn &apos;t good for you , like all women ! &apos;
&quot; You were lucky that I happened to pass by !
If I had not been curious , you would have become a barnacle ! &quot;
&quot; Hurry up , you two !
I need steam and no talking ! &quot;
&apos;I &apos;ve got to arrest her for that ! &apos;
&quot; Where is my wife ? &quot;
&quot; In prison , where it belongs . &quot;
&quot; Why is she in prison ? &quot;
&quot; Why don &apos;t you go to the night meal and find out for yourself ? &quot;
Thirty days .
Next time ! &quot; &quot;
<unk> was picked up with stolen clothes from the Harbour Pawn Shop . &apos;
&quot; How did they get them ? &quot;
&quot; My husband gave it to me . &quot;
&apos;Where &apos;s her husband ? &apos;
&apos;He &apos;s left me this morning . &apos;
&quot; How long have they been married ? &quot;
&quot; For one night . &quot;
Thirty days .
Next time ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; One moment , Commander !
I &apos;m her husband .
I stole the clothes ! &quot;
&quot; Break in somewhere , take what you need , so that &apos;s your idea ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir ! I rang the bell !
But there was no answer , so I just helped myself . &quot;
&apos;I &apos;m already a man of substance and I don &apos;t have time to waste .
What &apos;s their rush ? &apos;
&apos;Well sir , I &apos;m a stoker .
I &apos;ve only got one night on land and I want to have fun . &apos;
&quot; Sixty days will cool you down .
Let the Lady go free .
Next time ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sixty days is not a long journey , it will be my last if you wait for me .
&quot; Bill , I would wait for you forever . &quot;
Hollywood
The magic kingdom of the twentieth century !
The Mecca of the world !
Thus the Russian director Leo Andreyev traveled to Hollywod .
Every Russian in Hollywood is in this stack !
Sergius Alexander claims a general post in the Russian army and is also a cousin of the Tsar .
Has little film experience -- works for $ 7.50 a day .
Tells him he can start working tomorrow morning
and give him a general uniform .
The Eureka Studio is on the phone .
Tomorrow morning 6am at the gate of the studio !
The Hollywood queue .
Stop jostling !
What do you think you are ?
A chief constable !
A general !
Stop shaking your head !
How am I supposed to focus on makeup ?
Sorry .
I can &apos;t do anything about it .
I got a big shock the other day .
Where did you get that thing ? Did you steal it from a pawnshop ?
The czar gave it to me .
What do you know about it ?
The Tsar gave him this beautiful medal !
I &apos;m your mate .
I want to show it to everyone .
Empire of Russia , 1917 .
Proud , majestic , haughty .
Seems forever !
In dozens of far @-@ flung combat zones , Russia was in a death grip with the enemy .
Tired of defending a crumbling empire , Grand Duke Sergius Alexander cousin of the Tsar and leading general of the Russian army had arrived .
Everything is in the best order , Your Imperial Highness . You do not need to tire yourself with an inspection .
The revolutionaries have intercepted most of our supplies .
Let him strut his stuff .
His days are numbered !
The days of everyone pulling Russia down are numbered .
Only a few more weeks , but they seem eternal to me .
We have waited long enough to get impatient now !
They are due to appear at passport control tomorrow morning .
They are actors playing for our troops , their passports are being manufactured , but our reports show that they are revolutionaries .
Her name is Natália Dabrovová , the most dangerous revolutionary of Russia !
Grab them !
He is too dangerous and she too beautiful to escape my attention !
This is the second time this week that you wear my coat and smoke my cigarettes !
If he does it again , remove the cloak and shoot its contents .
So you are serving your country by acting !
Very patriotic while , Russia is fighting for survival !
Why don &apos;t you wear a uniform ?
I have weak lungs .
Perhaps it is only your courage that is too weak !
It does not take courage to send others into battle and death !
Arrest him !
What is her relationship with this man like ?

His name is Leo Andrejev , director of the Imperial Theatre of Kiev .
Commands from the General Staff , My Imperial Highness ! .
Will you honor us with your company ?
The new headquarters .
His Majesty the Tsar will visit the headquarters this afternoon to inspect the troops .
Recalls a division from the front . His Majesty thinks this war is a parlor game .
We can &apos;t do without a division .
We need every man !
No discussion !
Send a deloused and equipped division back quickly !
As the flames of war burn on the 2,000 @-@ mile front , the troops have to parry in front of the Tsar .
Your Imperial Highness , you must urgently send your commands !
The parade will be over right away !
Russia is also relying on you , dear cousin .
A week after thousands of men had shed their blood for a slice of earth , there was a calm .
Where is the woman ?
I ask that you accept this expression of gratitude for your company .
We &apos;d better make this after caviar !
The General Staff , Your Imperial Highness !
His Majesty is planning a visit to the front line tomorrow !
It would be advisable to stage an offensive for him tomorrow !
Just not too soon !
My troops are not prepared for an offensive !
I will not sacrifice them for the amusement of the Tsar !
That &apos;s what batter offers , for a revolution !
Don &apos;t you see that this man is seriously ill ?
I &apos;ll show you , you dirty revolutionary dog !
Do you not take too great a risk to contradict the Czar &apos;s wishes ?
I would take any risk to avoid unnecessary sacrifice .
So why are you continuing this senseless war ?
We have to win .
Defeat means revolution and the collapse of Russia !
Do you love Russia so much ?
I would like to die tonight if I could help Russia !
Before you die , you wouldn &apos;t have a coffee with me . In my room ?
You are truly beautiful !
It &apos;s easy to fall in love with you !
Your hand trembles !
Could they hand me my cigarettes ?
Their are really strong .
Why didn &apos;t they shoot ?
t know why I did not kill you .
I suppose because I can &apos;t kill anyone who loves Russia as much as you do !
From now on you are my prisoner of war .
and the captives of my love .
A group of obscure figures meet to determine Russia &apos;s fate .
Train number 476 transports Grand Duke Sergia Alexandra and his staff returning from the front !
Notify all our agents !
Tonight Russia will become a republic !
If the news at the next station is correct , His Highness will not soon forget this trip !
His Highness arrives in 5 minutes .
We give him the greatest welcome of his life !
All out , rulers of Russia !
Last stop !
We have been slaves for too long !
Now we are the rulers !
One day I will help you !
ll help you turn your head !
This is the end of Your Highness ! The ball is now in our court !
Let us hang him in Petrograd so that the whole world can see it !
Look at him !
The most powerful man in Russia even more powerful than the Tsar himself !
Let him sweat like we once did !
Let him heat our train to Petrogard !
Would His Highness take care of one of his cigarettes ?
Off to the locomotive !
This woman is mine .
She belongs in the coat !
Don &apos;t you understand ?
It was the only way to save your life .
I love you !
These pearls will make your escape from Russia possible !
I love you !
I love you !
Thus the aftershocks of a tormented nation brought another extras to Hollywood .
Bring the extras on stage !
The director has an important job for , you paps .
You have to look good doing it !
Is that supposed to be a Russian beard ?
Looks like an advert for cough sweets !
In Russia , it was worn on the left .
As a general , I must know .
I &apos;ve made 20 movies already .
You can &apos;t teach me anything more about Russia !
Bring me a whip !
I have waited 10 years for this moment , Your Imperial Highness .
The same coat , the same uniform , the same man , only times have changed !
This will be a trench scene just before the fight begins .
You are the commanding general !
The troops are tired of your fine speeches .
One gets rebellious and you .
beat him with this whip !
We don &apos;t have to rehearse that scene because you know how to deal with it .
Music please ! The national anthem of Russia .
Wind machine !
Headlights on !
Camera !
What difference does it make to who will win the war ?
We are fed up and tired of fighting .
You gave your last command !
A new day is dawning !
Down with your Russia !
Citizens of Russia , you have been misled by traitors ! We must win or Russia will perish !
The goal is given to win !
Long live Russia !
Did we win ?
Yes , Your Imperial Highness they have won !
Tough luck !
The guy was a damn good actor .
He was more than an actor , he was a great man .

THE PASSION OF THE YOUNG WOMAN OF ORLEANS
A film by Carl Th .
Dreyer
The Bibliotheque de la Chambre des Deputes in Paris houses one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world : the records of the trial of the
Joan of Arc , the trial that ended in her death .
The questions of the judges and Johannah &apos;s answers were recorded with great accuracy .
Reading it , one discovers the real Joan ... not in helmet and armour - but simple and humane ... a young woman who died for her country ... and we are witnessing an incredible drama :
a young , pious woman faces a group of narrow @-@ minded theologians and experienced jurists .
I swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ... nothing but the truth ...
In France they call me Jeanne ... in my village , I &apos;m called Jeannette .
How old are you ?
Nineteen ... I think .
Do you know the Lord &apos;s Prayer ?
Who taught you ?
My mother .
Will you say it ?
You claim to be sent by God ?
To save France ... that &apos;s why I was born .
So God hates the English ?
I don &apos;t know if God hates or loves the English ... but I do know that the English are all driven out of France ... except those who die here !
You said the Archangel Michael had appeared to you ... in what form ?
Did he have wings ?
Was he wearing a crown ?
How was he dressed ?
How did you know if it was a man or a woman ?
Was he naked ?
Do you think that God was not able to clothe Him ?
Did he have long hair ?
Why should he have cut it ?
Why are you dressed like a man ?
If we gave you women &apos;s clothes , would you wear them ?
When my divine mission is accomplished ... I will dress like a woman again .
So it was God who commanded you to dress as a man ?
And what reward do you expect from our Lord God ?
The salvation of my soul .
This is blasphemy .
This is disgusting !
To me , she &apos;s a saint .
Has God made you promises ?
This has nothing to do with this process .
Shouldn &apos;t we leave that question to the judges ?
Should we put this question to the vote ?

What was promised you by God ?
Maybe you would be freed from prison ?
When ?
I know neither the day ... nor the hour .
Since we could not so easily extract a confession from her ... we have to come up with something ...
Go look for a letter bearing the signature of King Charles .
Write a letter that I will dictate to you .
My sympathy for you is great !
Do you know our King &apos;s signature ?
I have a letter from him , for you .
I can &apos;t read .
To our dear Johanna ...
I am preparing to march with a large army to Rouen .
I send you this devoted priest . Have confidence in him .
Just as Jesus is the Son of God ... do you claim to be the daughter of God ?
Will you say the Lord &apos;s Prayer ?
God told you you would be released from prison ?
