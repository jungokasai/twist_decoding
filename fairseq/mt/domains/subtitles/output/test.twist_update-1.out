Look around you .
Everything moves , everything spins .
That &apos;s how we &apos;re born .
The sun , the moon , the planets and the stars are watching .
And we &apos;re in the middle .
Our situation .
But Nicholas Copernicus came and assumed that the sun would be in the middle , and we would circle the sun .
Just like the other planets .
An Earth that moves ?
But we don &apos;t see or feel anything about that , do we ?
That was 1543 .
Galileo made a telescope and aimed at the starry sky for the first time in 1610 .
He discovered moons near Jupiter and saw them orbiting the planet over the course of hours and days .
Later , Christiaan Huygens and Dominique Cassini also discovered moons on the planet Saturn .
Everything revolves around something else .
Should it be true ?
Johannes Kepler described these movements , and Isaac Newton caught them .
From apple to planet , everything followed its laws .
What about us ?
We got used to it and knew nothing else but that the sun was in the middle and we were orbiting it .
And the stars you perceive ?
The tape of foggy light , the Milky Way ?
All cultures had given it a special meaning :
For the Egyptians it was wheat of the Isis , the Incas saw golden dust in it , the Eskimos a snowtrack , the Christians the way to Rome .
It turns out that this Milky Way was also made up of stars :
from hundreds , thousands , millions of stars .
And then they discovered that they were also small fog .
Some spiral , others oval or uneven .
Where would they belong ?
How does it all fit together ?
We , the stars , the Milky Way , the fog ?
In the middle of the 19th century , you knew that all these points of light were actually suns .
That they had to be far away .
That the sun is a star that is very close .
And that was the universe , this amount of stars .
And our position in it ?
Spiral Galaxy The Milky Way unraveled
A film by Maarten Roos in collaboration with Pieter-Rim de Kroon
In the middle of the 19th century , the arrival of photography has brought a big turn in astronomical perception techniques .
Before that , astronomers in the northern sky had established the position and brightness of all stars visually , without photography .
With a telescope , they looked at the whole sky and wrote down the position and brightness for each star .
So they did an inventory until a certain brightness .
Such an inventory was called a search .
When photography had kept its entrance , there was an astronomer on the south hemisphere who said :
&apos;Let &apos;s do for the southern sky what was done for the northern sky , but with photography . &apos;
This astronomer was the director of the observatory of the Cape of Good Hope , David Gill .
I &apos;m sitting here by a photographic telescope similar to the one used by David Gill .
When taking pictures , the telescope must remain pointed at the same position in the sky .
You have to make sure that the telescope follows very precisely the daily movement of the sky .
There &apos;s a part of it where the photographic record was , like , here .
This is the flame of the remote pipe .
Parallel to that , there &apos;s another telescope down here to keep an eye on the sky .
So you look here to see if the telescope follows the sky right , and at the same time , the other part sometimes photographs with very long lighting times - the same piece of heaven .
This may take a few minutes , maybe even longer .
When it &apos;s ready , you have to take the plate out , aim for another piece of the sky , insert a new photographic record ;
And so it goes on and on until you &apos;ve covered the whole sky with photographic records .
So Gill started with that big project , photographing the southern sky .
However , he didn &apos;t immediately think how he was measured .
Around the same time , the astronomer Kapteyn had been appointed in Groningen .
It was expected that there would soon be a large telescope , but for reasons not quite clear , it did not come to that .
So Kapteyn thought :
There &apos;s got to be enough useful things to do without a telescope . &apos;
This is how the idea was created to work with David Gill and help him with the enormous measurements of the record collection .
They corresponded about it and that soon led to an agreement :
Kapteyn would make it his job to measure the records , while Gill would record more records .
One can wonder if the two of them were aware of the tremendous work they were doing .
Kapteyn , full of pleasure , worked for many years until he was finished .
It was finally published like three very thick volumes found at the Groninger Astronomical Institute .
It says almost nothing more than columns with digits that say which stars were recorded on the plates , how healthy they were , and where in the sky they were .
This great work has become known as Cape Photography Pattern .
So this is the first monumental work Kapteyn has distinguished himself with .
However , he must have also thought of all sorts of other astronomy issues .
In particular , this was the characteristics of the great collection of stars that we perceive in the sky as the Milky Way .
He made an important discovery in this area in 1 904 .
He discovered that the stars didn &apos;t just cross and cross each other , but that there were favors .
This was a very impressive discovery for the astronomical world , that there was regularity , which had always been assumed that it was just chaos !
It gave him even more credit and he put more trust in his plans to do more research on the Milky Way system working with foreign institutions .
At the end of his life , Kapteyn created a model .
of what the great swarm of stars , of which we are part , actually looked like .
In the model , all the perceptions he had collected over the years fit in as well as possible .
These were perceptions regarding the distance and movements of the stars .
We now call it the Kapteyn model .
This model could be compared to a thick window .
Within this disk , the density in which the stars appeared was the greatest .
The closer you got to the edge of this disc , the smaller that density got .
From the center to the edge , it was 30,000 light years .
That means the light takes 30,000 years to bridge that distance .
In the vertical direction of the disk , this distance was smaller , approximately 7,000 light years .
So this is a model that is easy to understand .
And Kapteyn must have found it a great success that , after all these years of research , he had developed a model of which he said :
Jacobus Kapleyn &apos;s Hall found a model for space :
a window with the sun about in the middle .
That also explained the Milky Way well .
However , there were other scientists who had a different opinion .
Perception showed that the universe had to be much bigger .
This created a huge debate in the 1920s .
It also became clear that all the spiral nebula had to be many times further away than the boundaries of Kapteyn space .
Slowly , this greater vision prevailed .
Also the assumption has increased that we are also in a flat spiral nebula .
And that the sun is not in the middle .
At the end of the 1920s , the young astronomer Jan Oort directed the spin of our Milky Way system from the movements of the sun-sown stars .
This could also explain the star streams that Kapteyn discovered at the beginning of the 20th century .
But how did we get an impression of our entire Milky Way system ?
Large amounts of dust between the stars prevented a clear view of faraway areas and the center .
Twenty years of searching for an answer .
I was an astronomy student , and of course I studied mathematics and physics .
In April / March 1943 , all students were to sign a declaration of allegiance to the Germans .
If you didn &apos;t want to , you had to go to work in Germany .
No student wanted this , and they had to hide .
That &apos;s easy to say , but where were you hiding ?
In a farm , but I didn &apos;t know a farmer .
Or in the North East Pole , where many students had hidden ?
I had the chance to hide here in this observatory with another student , Hans Hubenet .
We came here in May 1943 .
We sat down in a small room , door closed , curtains shut , and we were quiet all day .
After 6 o &apos;clock in the evening , when the staff of the observatory were gone , we could get out , but at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning we didn &apos;t have to be in the room .
And it went on like this every day .
Also , we were in a scientific environment , so I couldn &apos;t think of a better place to hide .
There were a few other students .
Hans and I were the only ones hiding .
Henk van de Hulst .
Henk only had to take his final exam , but the university was closed .
Henk had one big advantage : he was an assistant at the observatory .
His I.D. said &quot; assistant , &quot; and mine said &quot; student . &quot;
And the Germans caught the students .
But a &apos; assistant could be an accountant or assistant pharmacist ... he could be anything .
So Henk moved pretty freely .
Early 1944 something happened that we thought was very special .
Henk received an invasion from Professor Oort , the director of the suffering Observatory , to work with him for a few months .
Today , it &apos;s quite normal , but then it was whether to go to another continent .
The contacts were weird .
So Henk went after suffering , and then and then we got news about the people and the events that happened there .
After a few months , Henk came back with a very strange story .
Oort told Henk that in the years before the war ,
American physicists and engineers discovered radio emissions from space .
That was totally new and never heard of .
Where does the radio emission come from ?
Oort also wanted to catch the emission in the Netherlands and investigate it right after the war .
And he said , &apos; It would be scientifically interesting if there was a wavelength where there was more radio emissions than there were wavelengths .
Then you could focus on that . &apos;
And he asked Henk :
&apos;Henk , you &apos;re going back to Ucharter now .
Could you analyze this hypothesis if there &apos;s a wavelength where there &apos;s more radio emissions than there are wavelengths ? &apos;
And so we heard , hidden here , this story
We asked Henk what he would do now , and Henk said he would talk to Professor Rosenfeld .
Rosenfeld was a Belgium professor in theoretical physics , a master in quantum mechanics , etc .
So , Henk visited Rosenfeld .
Rosenfeld asked :
&apos;What &apos;s the richest gas or element in space ? &apos;
Answer : &apos; Hydrogen , Professor . &apos;
&apos;So , &apos; he said , &apos; then we have to start with hydrogen , and that &apos;s easy because hydrogen is the simplest atom . &apos;
It consists of an electric charged proton at the center , and an electric charged electron that orbits the proton like a planet around the sun .
You two are turning around their axis , too .
You can do this in the same direction , or opposite .
In the first case , the system has more power than in the second case .
When the electron turns around ,
When the electron turns around , and it radios out like radio emissions .
And Rosenfeld said , &apos; Henk , calculate the wavelength of the emission . &apos;
It &apos;s not hard to make a quick calculation .
And the answer was 21 cm !
So at a wavelength of 21 cm we can expect a stronger emission than any other wavelengths .
But the question is , &apos; Can this emission be measured ?
&apos;cause Rosenfeld also quickly calculated that the chance of an electron turning around is very small .
This happens once every ten million years per hydrogen atom !
Imagine that , ten million years .
And when you hear that , you think , &quot; No way !
But there is so much hydrogen in space that if all these small chances add up there can be a measurable emission .
Henk continued to research to determine how much radiation could be expected .
In April 1944 , there was a meeting of the Dutch astronomer club , the Association of Professional Astronomers .
They hit three times a year , now and then .
But in 1944 there were only a few participants , there were hardly any students , because it was difficult to travel during the war .
At this meeting , Henk made his prediction :
We can expect radio emissions from space at a wavelength of 21 cm and we , in the Netherlands , should make an effort to detect it .
Henk van de Hulst &apos;s prediction was and remained a prediction .
Scientific experiments were not possible , especially if it smelled like radio communication .
But if it were true , if this radio radiation really existed , it would have been a tremendous help in exploring the Milky Way system .
Radio radiation at this wavelength has little or no hindsight of dust in the Milky Way , and could reach us from all parts of the Milky Way system !
Right after the war , Oort wanted to build a large radio telescope with 25 meters of incisions .
But industry and technology were flat .
Funding for that project was also not possible .
But Oort got impatient .
Fortunately , the Dutch telecomity service had brought in some German radar dish from the dunes on the more after the radio station in Cootwiwewee .
It was the so-called spicburg bowl that was part of the Atlantic Wall .
Iris de Voogt provided one of these receivers for research after the Milky Way system in 1948 .
We hope this is the right place .
You can &apos;t find anything back from the old radar dish .
It disappeared late in the &apos; 50s .
But we see the old main building of the radio station and some other buildings .
And we see that we are in about the right place here .
We &apos;re in Hoeven now , with some spicburg giant radar dish .
I &apos;m a little confused by the color because this white color doesn &apos;t fit .
Actually , all those bowls that formed the Atlantic Wall were protective paint green .
But what &apos;s left is a real spicburg giant telescope , 25 feet of dim , a small staircase , everything ...
Apart from a relish mirror , you also need a good receiver .
But there were no 21 cm receivers at the time .
And the technical school in Delft had been closed during the war and there were no engineers educated .
Oort found a physics student from suffering who was trying to build a receiver .
But a year and a half later , he hadn &apos;t gotten much further , and then he made a mistake and everything was burned down .
On March 10 , 1950 , a year and a half of work was lost .
Then Oort was looking for a new engineer , from the new generation from the school in Delft :
Lex Muller .
Muller was also a very active radio amateur .
At the end of 1950 , he started working for the Dutch Organization for Research on Radioradiation from the Sun and the Milky Way .
He came to KootwiWi-Fi and five months later he managed to detect the 9 cm radio emission from the Milky Way system for the first time :
May 11 , 1951 .
A month and a half earlier , a student from Harvard University in America ,
Harold Ewen , it also worked to detect the radiation for the first time .
No wonder because the Americans had a lot of experience with microwave technology , since they developed it during the war .
Henk van de Hulst was at Harvard at the time , providing communication between Harvard , suffering and cootwiweweeds .
The results of these initial measurements have been published together .
For several weeks , Lex Muller made test perceptions and he drew the conclusion that he needed a better receiver for a big search .
So he took everything from each other and spent a year building a better receiver .
In March 1952 , when the new receiver was almost ready , I went to Kootwiware for a month and a half to give our telescope away .
We needed to know exactly where the telescope was directed .
For this , we needed new indicators of azimuth and height , corresponding with the telescope &apos;s horizontal and vertical movements .
Along with a technician from the KootwiWi-Fi radio station , we &apos;ve improved the indicators .
They were not precise and had a false zero point .
We also set the small discrepancies that were left to correct it .
When that was done , the large patrols of the Milky Lane equator could begin .
After my study , I came here in 1954 .
There was a little cottage near the telescope where I worked .
We put the Milky Way in map .
The perceptions were done day and night by students from suffering who then came here in Kootwigi .
There were always three students , one for day duty , one for evening duty and one for night duty .
I helped them a bit day and night .
There was a clock in the telescope that had to be set .
To move the telescope , there were two handles , one for the azimuth , and one for height .
As the Earth rotates , we had to adjust the location of the telescope every three minutes .
Lists of these positions have been prepared in suffering .
And it was all by hand .
The first series of shows had taken a year , from June 1952 to June 1953 .
Meanwhile , Henk van de Hulst received an invasion from Oxford to give the famous Halley reading .
For this , he wanted to show the first plan of distributing hydrogen clouds in the Milky Way system .
So we had to put together a first plan before his reading !
To make it possible for Henk van de Hulst to show the first plan of the Milky Way system , Oort , the director of Disease Observatory , a crash operation .
Every employee of the observatory worked on it .
Me , too , with my college students .
Maarten Schmidt , Gart Westerhout .
We sat in the Observation Room for a week , I was almost told , open-minded .
Our job was to work on the perceptions from KootwiWi-Fi , make bills on them and give the results to Henk van de Hulst so that he could put together a plan .
Everyone had a stack of measurements from the same position in the sky .
So each perception was a recording of the radio emission as function of the wavelength or frequency .
The recording begins so trembling , almost zero , since there is no emission .
Then it rises to a maximum , a large radio emission .
Then it falls again , and it rises to a greater maximum , and then it falls back to zero .
What happened ?
The recipient &apos;s frequency has been changed slowly over the course of an hour or two .
So he recorded the laundry emissions at different frequencies .
Why did they do that ?
I remind you of the doppler effect we all know when an ambulance or police car comes by .
A car like that makes a certain tone .
And when he approaches , we hear a higher tone than when he moves away .
The higher the sound , the higher the frequency of the vocal wave .
And that depends on the speed of the car relative to the observer .
The same principle was used with the radio receiver in KootwiWi-Fi .
He picked up the radio waves emitted by hydrogen .
As the hydrogen atoms approach , we perceive a higher frequency , and as they move away a low frequency .
Higher frequency means shorter wavelength .
Less frequency means longer wavelength .
So this principle has been used here .
The recording shows the intensity of the radio emission on various wavelengths .
This corresponds with a number of hydrogen atoms at a safe speed in a dairy system .
Our task was to measure the parameters at different frequencies .
From that , we determined the number of hydrogen atoms and calculated their velocity .
Also , many shots were made at every position in the Milky Way because the radio emission is weak and the receiver added a lot of noise .
In order to reduce the noise , we repeated the recordings several times .
We then had three , five or ten recordings and had to determine the middle value so that the signal would be stronger and the noise would weaken .
And we gave the result to Henk van de Hulst .
From that , he determined where the hydrogen atoms were at different speeds in the Milky Way system .
You can see that the hydrogen clouds are in a spiral band around the galactic center .
Here is the sun , here is the galactic center and the hydrogen clouds are so in one arm around it .
Very similar to what you know of extragalactic spiral nebula .
So that was a first indication that the Milky Way system has spiral arms of hydrogen gas .
Something you didn &apos;t know before .
This was the big surprise Van de Hulst announced in his Oxford reading :
a spiral structure of the Milky Way system had been discovered , based on the perceptions from Kootwiware .
After the Oxford reading , a second search was started in November 1953 .
Here we not only detected the Milky Way equator , but also 10 degrees above and 10 degrees below , in hundreds of positions .
We used the radio emissions as a function of velocity and disagreed with the distribution of hydrogen gas in the Milky Way system , over and under the Milky Way equator .
In this way , we created a three-dimensional plan of the Milky Way system .
And so we mapped the Milky Way system , from the part you can see from the Netherlands , because you can &apos;t see the whole Michstrasse .
That resulted in this beautiful colored plan .
He was so beautiful that he hung on a wall in the observatory for several months .
You see four spiral alarms .
The one out of arm we already knew from the first pattern , and these dark areas here in the inner part of the Milky Way system .
But , as you can see , there &apos;s a part missing here .
That &apos;s the part you can &apos;t see from the Netherlands .
There were college astronomers from Sydney , Australia , who had also started making radio take .
The head of this group , Frank Kerr , came after suffering to work together .
He treated his data in a similar way when we did for our patrols .
And this plan shows the combination of the Dutch and Australian results .
You see a difference between the parts .
You notice that the Dutch part looks sharper than the Australian part , which is because the Australians used a slightly different method .
But the spiral alarms of both parts connect well !
The important point of this diagram is that you can clearly see how the hydrogen gas in the Milky Way system is distributed in spiral alarms .
Just as this paper says in the title :
&apos;The Galactic System as a Spiral Nebula . &apos; The Galactic System is a spiral nebula .
Compared to the spiral nebula we &apos;ve known for a long time from photos like this one .
So this was the big result of the cootwiki reconnaissance in collaboration with our colleagues from Sydney .
Our situation has now been clearly proven :
a planet around a normal star , somewhere on the edge of an ordinary Milky Way system of stars , gas and dust with spiral arms .
And there are millions and millions of them .
Dutch astronomy had made a large and valuable contribution to this insight .
The Netherlands still play an important role in an area where new discoveries are still being made , new instruments are being developed and the limits of our skills and knowledge are being continued .

THE DEATH Kiss Detective drama in three acts
The case of Dr. Monro , who died on April 1 in mysterious circumstances , is being investigated .
The first witness , Anna Harper , the dead man &apos;s housekeeper .
&quot; When I set the breakfast table ... &quot;
&quot; ... the doctor &apos;s daughter cried out that something bad had happened . &quot;
&quot; The doctor was lying in the hall , dead . &quot;
&quot; A man I had never seen told me not to touch anything and to open it to the police . &quot;
&quot; The servant was arrested on the basis of his testimony . &quot;
The testimony of the second witness .
Mr. Weyler , Chief Engineer of United Mechanics , reports :
If the designs aren &apos;t made on April 1st , we will lose millions and you will lose your position ...
&quot; For weeks I was tired and unable to work . &quot;
&quot; I was treated by my family doctor Dr. Monro ... &quot;
&quot; Even though I took his medicine , I became more and more powerful . &quot;
&quot; My boss was angry because I didn &apos;t get ahead . &quot;
&quot; The blueprints are April 1st ! &quot;
Your work is more important to you than our marriage !
I &apos;m leaving you and returning to my parents .
You &apos;ll never see me again !
&quot; An engineer named Lebel came to show me an invention . &quot;
&quot; I made an astonishing discovery ... &quot;
&quot; We look alike !
Show me your profile . &quot;
&quot; I had a crazy idea . &quot;
&quot; If I do not finish , I will lose my position .
&quot; At first he thought my idea was absurd ... &quot;
&quot; But then we changed clothes ... &quot;
&quot; We took a test to clear up any last doubts . &quot;
&quot; And since my wife had left me , he said yes . &quot;
&quot; I retired to a sanatorium . &quot;
End of Act One
Act Two
The testimony of the third witness .
As a third witness , engineer Lebel testifies that Dr. Monro was not thrilled to find him healthy .
In order not to betray himself , he also took the prescribed medicine and became ill .
Another doctor , Dr. Adell , examined him and discovered that the medicine contained poison .
After he stopped taking the medicine , he was able to work again .
Neither did Weyler &apos;s wife .
The designs were finished on March 30 , but they were stolen the same night .
He could remember a dark figure in the room .
&quot; The next morning ... &quot;
&quot; I was horrified to see that the most important drawing was missing . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Adell wanted to help me clarify the incident . &quot;
&quot; That evening we made our preparations . &quot;
&quot; Again I saw the mystery man ... &quot;
&quot; He felt my pulse and said :
Strange , that &apos;s not Weyler ! &quot;
&quot; Then he tried to open the safe . &quot;
&quot; I was still dazed by the gas , but I could still follow him . &quot;
&quot; No sign of the burglar , just a man , lonely at night . &quot;
&quot; The man was Dr. Monro . &quot;
&quot; In the garden we found the burglar &apos;s mask and cape . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Monro wanted to examine the mask at home . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to be there and I followed him . &quot;
&quot; I asked Dr. Adell to wait for me at home . &quot;
End of Act 2
Act Three
&quot; I accompanied Dr. Monro home . &quot;
&quot; The door was locked from the outside . &quot;
&quot; The other door was locked , too .
I heard footsteps , the key moved ... &quot;
&quot; Monro &apos;s daughter came in and asked about her father . &quot;
&quot; When the girl was in bed and I went into the hall , I heard voices ... &quot;
Lebel understands that United Mechanics competitor is behind Weyler &apos;s assassination attempt , and he is now in danger .
In order not to give himself away , he stays with Monro overnight .
In the morning , hot chocolate is served .
Monro &apos;s daughter is coming in .
She knocks on the tray and spills chocolate .
Dr. Monro takes her in his arms and gives her a kiss .
A kiss of death , a few seconds later he &apos;s dead .
&quot; Dr. Adell found a deadly poison in the sugar bowl . &quot;
&quot; I took the stolen drawings to Weyler &apos;s company and , my wife , returned and threw herself into my arms . &quot;
&quot; But then her husband came ! &quot;
The End
Selma Lagerlöf , Mr. Arne &apos;s treasure , winter ballad in five files .
Once upon a time , when King Johann III ruled over Sweden , there was a winter as hard as the country had been since the memory of man .
The King had uncovered a conspiracy among his Scottish mercenaries .
They were banished from the realm and placed under guard until they crossed the border .
Their leaders , bold and intrepid men , were imprisoned in a tower .
... and the youngest of them , Sir Archie .
As long as they were in the Swedish king &apos;s field , they didn &apos;t dare reveal themselves .
They procured leather lambs and pretended to be tannermen who went ashore looking for work .
... and when they reached the border , they were starving .
At that time there lived in Marstrand a poor fishmonger named Torarin .
He moved around a lot selling salted and dried fish .
&quot; I heard some big news today , Grim .
The sea is frozen , not only the bay and the sun , but far out .
&quot; When we stop by the Solberga vicarage , Grim , &quot; we can check there , see if the ice carries all the way to Marstrand . &quot;
The dog mostly lay still and listened to his master in silence .
But when he heard something that didn &apos;t please him , he stood up , kept his mouth shut in the wind , and howled - as if he were a wolf .
&quot; What do you have against Solberga , my dear ? &quot;
&quot; We both went to the rectory to visit Mr. Arne a lot . &quot;
In the parsonage near Solberga , the priest , Mr. Arne , sat with his family and the servants at the meal .
The priest was old and white , but still a strong and rusty man .
His wife , however , had a hard time with the years .
On the other hand , Mr. Arne was the assistant minister .
At the end of the table , Mr. Arne &apos;s granddaughter , Berghild , and Elsalill , her foster sister , an orphan who had been raised in the rectory .
Torarin was the only stranger there he could not turn his gaze upon the great oak truce that stood at the foot of the heavenly prayer .
As poor as Torarin was , he did not want to possess this money , for he had heard that Mr. Arne had taken it from the great monasteries that had once existed in the country , and that the old monks had prophesied that this money would bring him misfortune .
&quot; Why do they sharpen the knives in Branehög ? &quot;
&quot; But tell me , why are they sharpening their long knives in Branehög tonight ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you hear them scratch and scrape ? &quot;
&quot; Can &apos;t you hear the crunch and creaking ? &quot;
&quot; How can you hear them grinding knives in Branehög ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s more than a mile from here . &quot;
&quot; Take your spoon again and let &apos;s finish the meal . &quot;
On the same evening there was a cheerful party at the Branehög Inn ... and all the villagers were invited .
&quot; It is true , as they say , that those who have the shortest route always come last . &quot;
&quot; I still see them standing there sharpening their knives . &quot;
&quot; God knows what they have in mind . &quot;
&quot; It will probably be nothing more than that the vicar &apos;s wife heard three tannermen fix her tools . &quot;
Long after midnight , a few men went out and spiked their horses to go home .
&quot; Stand up !
Get up !
The Reverend of Solberga is on fire !
&quot; Mr. Arne and his family were murdered the night of three men in leather deserts who had climbed over the roof . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Arne &apos;s horse was stolen from the stable &quot; and his sleigh was stolen from the shed .
The poor orphan girl was the only one to escape the bloodbath .
Torarin &apos;s hut was high up on the highest point of the island , and all those who were being held by the frost in Marstrand climbed over and over the cabin to see if the frozen bay and the sun cover ...
Often Elsalill stood there and watched them go up there .
She thought how happy they were all because they had something to yearn for .
You yourself asked for nothing more in the world .
&quot; I am not so rich , Elsalill , that I can give you food and clothes , &quot; so that you can put your hands in your lap and think about your worries . &quot;
&quot; Oh , Mother Katri , the last one they killed was my foster sister . &quot;
&quot; She begged for her life , but one of them stabbed her in the heart . &quot;
&quot; If I hadn &apos;t been hiding behind the stove , I &apos;d be with my dear nurse . &quot;
&quot; I wish they were still alive so that I could tear their heart out of their chest , I wish they were still alive , so I could see them quartered and tied to the wheel . &quot;
&quot; We have not come to frighten you , virgin . &quot; &quot; We only ask you to let us hear your story . &quot;
&quot; We have come to Marstrand because we want to translate to Scotland , &quot; &quot; but the bill is frozen .
That &apos;s why we have to pass the time here , and we would be very happy , virgin , if you would let us hear your story .
&quot; Go ahead and show them that you are not too small to speak to a gentleman , Elsalill . &quot;
&quot; You are a virgin of good breeding , not a fishing girl . &quot;
Since that day Sir Archie often came to Torarin &apos;s cabin to talk to Elsalill ...
&quot; God himself has sent you to me , Elsalill ! &quot;
&quot; Elsalill , will you come with me to Scotland - as my wife ? &quot;
&quot; There I will build a castle for you , and make you a noble lady . &quot;
&quot; See the hair in my hand , Elsalill ? &quot;
&quot; Do you see the blonde curl ? &quot;
&quot; And so , the hair of my foster sister wrapped around the hand of the one who killed her . &quot;
&quot; We were afraid for no reason , Elsalill .
You see , it was nothing but a ray of sunshine falling through the window .
&quot; Sir Archie , why did you remind me of the dead ? &quot;
&quot; Let me , let me , Sir Archie , for now I have only the dead in mind . &quot;
&quot; Grim , my dog , now you can no longer doubt that we are going across the sea . &quot;
You see , there &apos;s a big ship frozen in the ice . &quot;
&quot; What do you think if we greet the captain , Grim , and see if he wants to buy fish ? &quot;
Should the ice never break , should the passage to Scotland never be possible ?
Sir Archie wanted to question the captain about it .
&quot; You who get around everywhere and hear what &apos;s happening , do you know why God has been keeping us all in the sea for so long this year and keeping us all prisoner ? &quot;
&quot; I once lay in the harbour of mountains for a full month , and every day there was such a strong wind that no ship could sail ... &quot;
But aboard one of the ships that was trapped in the harbor , there was a church robber , and he would have escaped if the storm had not raged ... &quot;
&quot; ... and as soon as he was brought ashore , the weather cleared up and we had a good wind ... &quot;
&quot; Do you now understand what I mean by my question if you know why God keeps the gates to the sea closed ? &quot;
&quot; He wanted to sail to Scotland for himself and his men , &quot; &quot; but I don &apos;t think of sailing with such lawless fellows onboard ... &quot;
Some time later Elsalill had a strange dream she saw her dead foster sister standing in front of her ...
Elsalill saw that they were in a room in the council cellar , where the waitress was washing dishes and dishes , and she felt as if her nurse was asking her to help her wash the dishes .
The next day , her dream was still very much alive in her memory and irresistibly moved her to the places her foster sister had taken her to in her dream .
&quot; Instead of just standing here , you can come in and help me wash down the pots and plates . &quot;
&quot; Drink , my brother !
We still have Mr. Arne &apos;s treasure ! &quot;
She couldn &apos;t betray him .
She was too fond of him .
She couldn &apos;t put him on the rack and on the bike .
She couldn &apos;t watch them burn his hands and feet .
&quot; God bless you for coming to me tonight , Elsalill ! &quot;
&quot; Elsalill , I haven &apos;t come to you for a few days , because I &apos;ve been tormented by heavy thoughts . &quot;
&quot; But when I found you out here , my heart told me , &quot; - &quot; what I must do to be free of my torments for all time . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m crying , Sir Archie , because I have too much love in my heart for you . &quot;
&quot; Soon the sea will be open and the ships will be able to sail to my home . &quot;
&quot; Elsalill , will you follow me there ? &quot;
&quot; You must come with me , Elsalill , or it will be my downfall . &quot;
&quot; I will come to you tonight , Elsalill . &quot;
&quot; I must have an answer from you today . &quot;
&quot; Why are you standing in the street crying ? &quot;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you stay in the council cellar ? &quot;
&quot; I left so that I wouldn &apos;t have to listen to the speeches of the criminals sitting in the hall . &quot;
&quot; And yet I heard three men talking and one said , &quot; Drink , my brother , we still have Mr. Arne &apos;s treasure ! &quot;
&quot; If you &apos;ve heard such words there , Virgin , you can &apos;t run away now . &quot;
&quot; You must go with me to those who have the power and the will to apprehend the murderers and bring them to their punishment . &quot;
The captain sent a message telling Sir Archie and his men to bring their luggage aboard .
In the West , the ice had begun to crack , and it might well be that they would find an open way to Scotland before dawn .
&quot; Go to the inn and fix everything . &quot;
&quot; I have a few things to discuss with Elsalill . &quot;
&quot; Sir Reginald and Sir Philip went to the inn and Sir Archie went to Torarin . &quot;
&quot; Flee , Sir Archie , the City Watch is after you . &quot;
&quot; They &apos;re coming because they &apos;re looking for Mr. Arne &apos;s killers . &quot;
&quot; Was it you , Elsalill , who recognized and betrayed me ? &quot;
&quot; They are coming to seize you .
&quot; Do you not realize that this is the end of all my hope of ever atoning for my guilt ? &quot;
&quot; But why did you do it , Sir Archie ? &quot;
&quot; We were mad with hunger and cold , and intoxicated by the brandy we had drunk . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t know what I was doing anymore . &quot;
&quot; Why did you abandon me at the very moment I believed in you the most ? &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t have to worry about me , Elsalill , tonight , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m myself again .
I &apos;m back in my old mood now ... &quot;
&quot; ... and tonight nothing bad will happen to me , either , you &apos;ll see . &quot;
... and holding Elsalill like a shield , Sir Archie jumped towards the exit .
She loved a werewolf , she protected a wretched murderer with her body .
And with the next step Sir Archie took , the spear penetrated deep into Elsalill &apos;s heart .
All night long , the captain of the great ship ran up and down on the quarterdeck ...
It &apos;s hard to say why the captain was out on such a stormy night .
His entire crew was on board , as were the fellow passengers he was supposed to bring over to Scotland .
It was only when a grey morning dawned that the captain saw what he had been waiting for so long .
The bay and the sun were open to the sea .
But where their ship was frozen , there was not the slightest crack in the ice .
&quot; I have come to fetch the virgin who brought the Scots to the ship yesterday ... &quot;
&quot; Last night , she was dragged away by Mr. Arne &apos;s killers , and they brought her here to the ship ... &quot;
&quot; No , the City Watch dares not come out . &quot;
&quot; They say there are a hundred mercenaries on board , and they don &apos;t want to mess with them ... &quot;
&quot; I now know why we are trapped here while the other ships have already gone out to sea . &quot;
&quot; Hold and obey this man &apos;s word .
He only does God &apos;s will ! &quot;
And after the killers had been brought ashore , the storm began to rage again .
And from the high aft deck , the captain saw a long line of people pouring out to the ship .
It was all the women of Marstrand , young and old , in mourning clothes .
And with them came boys carrying a stretcher .
They had come to take the virgin who loved a criminal and who had given her life to destroy the one she loved .
... and as the women returned to the city , the storm and the waves behind them swirled the ice aside .
And when they arrived in Marstrand with Elsalill , the gates of the sea were wide open .

THE DRIVER OF DEATH
Directed by VICTOR SOUTHERS Director of Photography :
J. JULIUS YAENZON
Once upon a time there was a poor Salvation Army nurse who was dying .
For a year , she had severe consumption .
When there was no hope , she went to her mother .
With her was a savior from the Salvation Army .
&quot; Don &apos;t think of the poor , sister Edit !
You &apos;ve done enough for her . &quot;
&quot; Get David Holm ! &quot;
&quot; My daughter was with you until the end .
Let her die with me now ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you hear , Maria ?
Get David Holm ! &quot;
&quot; Get him now ! &quot;
&quot; Impossible !
You can &apos;t let David Holm see a dying woman ! &quot;
I couldn &apos;t find him anywhere .
Gustafsson will bring him here . &quot;
&quot; Poor Mrs. Holm ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll walk you home .
Don &apos;t let your husband see you here . &quot;
This evening was no ordinary evening .
It was New Year &apos;s Eve .
&quot; Here we drink to New Year &apos;s Eve at the right time ! &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s scary to be celebrating New Year &apos;s Eve here with the dead . &quot;
&quot; Are the gentlemen afraid of ghosts ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you a New Year &apos;s Eve story by midnight . &quot;
&quot; I had a good friend named Georges who was always in a good mood . &quot;
&quot; He came from a good family and had studied in Uppsala . &quot;
&quot; But on New Year &apos;s Eve , he was suddenly changed . &quot;
&quot; Remember , it &apos;s New Year &apos;s Eve , the last day of the year ! &quot;
&quot; Whoever dies today will have to drive the funeral car for a year . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s an old car ... &quot;
&quot; No ordinary carriage driver guides him and he serves a strict master , death . &quot;
&quot; A hundred years on earth is only a day for him .
Day and night he stands in the service of his master . &quot;
End of Part 2 Part 2
&quot; Wherever he goes , suffering and pain meet him . &quot;
&quot; Nowhere can he escape his heavy office . &quot;
&quot; The car is not always driven by the same driver . &quot;
&quot; The last person to die at midnight on New Year &apos;s Eve will be the driver for the following year . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s why I &apos;m afraid something will happen to me on New Year &apos;s Eve . &quot;
&quot; The strange thing is , Georges died on the same New Year &apos;s Eve . &quot;
&quot; Why doesn &apos;t Gustafsson come with David Holm ? &quot;
&quot; Come on , David Holm !
Sister Edit is dying , she wants to see you ! &quot;
&quot; Hurry up when Sister Edit calls you ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , David , that it is you who redeems me ! &quot;
&quot; You better get me to the hospital right now ! &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s no living person driving this car .
When I come , any help is too late . &quot;
&quot; You know it &apos;s a dead man talking to you . &quot;
&quot; And you will have to pay for the consequences of your actions . &quot;
&quot; I know it &apos;s my fault that you ended up like this . &quot;
&quot; Without me , you would have lived an honorable life with your family . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re free tomorrow .
But before that , a harsher punishment will strike you ! &quot;
&quot; Your brother murdered in a frenzy and is going to jail ! &quot;
&quot; You should be going to prison instead of your brother , because you made him a murderer ! &quot;
&quot; Doesn &apos;t that put you off your path ? &quot;
&quot; Now I know what it &apos;s like to bring so much misery on someone you love ! &quot;
&quot; And your wife and children ? &quot;
&quot; I know how hard they &apos;ve had it .
But now I &apos;m starting a new life ! &quot;
End of Part 2 . Part 3 .
At least she wasn &apos;t sick when she left here .
&quot; I thought I could come home with joy ! &quot;
&quot; Without warning , she let me come into an empty house !
That was heartless ! &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll get rid of the laughter !
I &apos;ll show her what it &apos;s like when your heart freezes ! &quot;
&quot; You searched for your wife all over the country , and your hatred and vengeance grew beyond measure . &quot;
&quot; A year ago , on New Year &apos;s Eve , you came to this city , and with you the misfortune . &quot;
&quot; On that day , the Salvation Army opened its new base . &quot;
&quot; No , I don &apos;t want food , I just want to sleep . &quot;
&quot; Leave the jacket !
We don &apos;t know how contagious he is . &quot;
&quot; How happy I am to help the first guest whom God has sent here ! &quot;
&quot; Go to sleep .
I &apos;ll do the rest . &quot;
&quot; Jesus Christ , give our guest a happy New Year ! &quot;
She sat over her jacket all night without thinking of contagion .
When she went to bed , the room was completely cold .
&quot; Did you sew my jacket ? &quot;
&quot; Get the person who did this ! &quot;
&quot; The young lady tried for nothing , I &apos;m used to it differently . &quot;
&quot; Please come back next New Year &apos;s Eve ! &quot;
&quot; I want to know if Jesus Christ answered my New Year &apos;s prayer for you . &quot;
&quot; Yes , I &apos;m coming back to show that your talk didn &apos;t arrive . &quot;
&quot; Now keep your promise and go to Sister Edit before you take over my office .
&quot; The most beautiful thing you &apos;ve had - and lost .
You cannot escape your guilty conscience or my office . &quot;
&quot; Prisoner soul , get out of your prison ! &quot;
&quot; Your soul was released at midnight .
Now you have to get the souls off the earth ! &quot;
End of three . Part four .
&quot; Death , he comes too soon . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not afraid .
But before I go , I &apos;ve got to talk to someone . &quot;
&quot; I have caused great harm .
I can &apos;t go before God like this . &quot;
&quot; The man I want to talk to is the man I love ! &quot;
&quot; I could give you a reprieve , but you have no power over this man ! &quot;
&quot; All your hopes and attempts to change him have been disappointed . &quot;
&quot; You seduced him and made him a drunkard ! &quot;
&quot; Do not let yourself be dragged to ruin ! &quot;
- The Salvation Army - Great welcome meeting
&quot; Let me save you , and I &apos;ll watch you do it ! &quot;
&quot; What is this ?
I &apos;m coughing up my consumption in people &apos;s faces ! &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s kidding .
He &apos;s not that bad ! &quot;
&quot; How can you live with such a bitter hatred of your fellow man ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t worry .
You &apos;ll be rid of me in a few days . &quot;
&quot; No , you can &apos;t leave ! &quot;
&quot; And if time passes even with quarrels . &quot;
&quot; Very tempting , but I can &apos;t do that . &quot;
&quot; I travel all over Sweden to look for someone I absolutely must find . &quot;
&quot; Who is this person ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll find out when I find them ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m the person David Holm is looking for . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m his wife . &quot;
&quot; Life with him was unbearable .
I secretly left him with the children . &quot;
&quot; I thought he wasn &apos;t looking for me here , so far from where we used to live . &quot;
&quot; Take him with you !
&quot; Think about it and let &apos;s talk again soon . &quot;
She had worked her way through and demanded nothing for herself .
&quot; Come with me !
A surprise awaits you ! &quot;
End of 4th Part 5 .
She wanted to replant what she had planted in the thorns .
She almost reached her destination ...
&quot; The doctor says she has pneumonia .
&quot; Your resistance force is completely exhausted . &quot;
&quot; David Holm became her undoing .
She &apos;s always worrying about him and his wife . &quot;
&quot; Leave the children alone so they don &apos;t get infected . &quot;
&quot; You couldn &apos;t run away this time ! &quot;
&quot; When will you stop taking revenge , David ? &quot;
&quot; If only I hadn &apos;t brought them back together !
Then his guilt would not be so great ! &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t die yet !
First I have to see how he &apos;s changed ! &quot;
&quot; Today I love him more than ever ! &quot;
&quot; Prisoner soul , get out of your prison ! &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s go .
The ones who will take care of them will come soon . &quot;
&quot; David , I want to give people a New Year &apos;s message . &quot;
&quot; Let them remember this message :
&quot; God , let my soul ripen before the harvest ! &quot;
&quot; Why are we here ?
&quot; I can &apos;t stand it any longer ! &quot;
&quot; It is a sin , but I cannot leave you behind . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be angry with me .
It &apos;s not my fault . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll see that it &apos;s enough for the three of us , David ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , I see it .
It &apos;s my duty to watch . &quot;
&quot; The poor creatures must not die !
Don &apos;t do this to me ! &quot;
&quot; I have no power over the living . &quot;
&quot; Should I pray to God or Jesus ?
Who has the power , where shall I turn ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , poor sinner !
I pray to you , Lord of Life and Death !
I have broken your commandments . &quot;
&quot; Do whatever you want with me .
But spare my wife and children . &quot;
&quot; Now I don &apos;t have to worry about you anymore . &quot;
I got here just in time ! &quot;
I promised her I &apos;d be good to you . &quot;
Maria said you didn &apos;t come . &quot;
&quot; No one believes me that I &apos;m trying to improve .
How can I not cry ? &quot;
&quot; If you cry , David , I believe you . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s only when I &apos;ve wept all the grief out that I &apos;m happy . &quot;
&quot; God , let my soul ripen before the harvest ! &quot;
The End
Fighting hearts ( The Four for the Woman )
During a break from the stock exchange .
This is the broker Yquem .
He has the most beautiful wife you can imagine .
Shall I call my master and announce to him that madam ...
No !
I want to give him a surprise !
Good job , isn &apos;t it ?
No doubt :
A great imitation !
Today you can close !
Hey !
What do you want here ?
If only you had a few marks for me .
I am in desperate need !
Werner Krafft ?
Hmm ...
Do you know a certain William Krafft ?
William Krafft is my brother &apos;s name !
He used to stay at the City Hotel ...
I haven &apos;t seen him in five years ...
I had to leave Europe because ...
I will gladly support William Krafft &apos;s brother .
The Brilliant Exchange .
For Florence .
You know what , Krafft ?
Her brother Werner was here .
I lent him money , William , because ... because I thought ...
I really need a ring that looks just like this one tonight !
His name is Krafft .
To the City Hotel
Mr. Yquem closed the bureau a little early today , madam .
No , madam , the gentleman hasn &apos;t returned yet .
It &apos;s a woman named Florence Forster .
She disappeared four years ago .
Her whereabouts are unknown .
The City Hotel .
How sad is the day that I will spend it away from you !
Margot , a friend of Florence &apos;s .
Let me have a souper à deux tonight ...
Turtle soup ?
Baked oysters ?
No .
Pâté de foie gras en croûte .
With white port vintage 1864 , then roast beef with Coeur d &apos;artichauts , mushrooms , sauce rémoulade .
Also a rather fiery Chambertin vintage 1911 ...
I don &apos;t want dessert , but cheese ... baked , and Heidsieck &quot; goût américain . &quot;
Mr. Krafft has just gone out .
Anyway , I need a room .
It is customary for us that guests without luggage pay their room in advance .
Old Upton sends you this .
In the meantime , you can wait here for Mr. Krafft .
How well you look , my child .
But what &apos;s the point of all this if your husband is always travelling ?
However , a beautiful woman does not necessarily have to be faithful to her husband !
Mr. Krafft left the hotel about an hour ago , but at 10 : 00 he ordered dinner for two .
I love my husband more than anything , Margot .
But didn &apos;t you love another man before you got married ?
There was a lot of talk about it at the time , but no one knew exactly who the person was .
I didn &apos;t love my husband then as I love him now .
My heart belonged to another .
And when my father , against my will , chose Harry as my husband ...
I must speak to Miss Florence again at all costs !
There is no point in telling you the name of my future husband !
It would be pointless to fight against my father &apos;s will .
Let &apos;s go upstairs and see if Florence has recovered from her migraine .
She &apos;s not alone !
And then ?
And then ?
Now you &apos;ve made me curious about your story , and I &apos;m curious to hear what happened next !
Is Mr. Yquem home ?
Then please report me to his wife .
This is very interesting , very interesting !
And your husband never found out what really happened ?
I don &apos;t understand you , Florence !
Why did you reject this visitor ?
Only yesterday I met a gentleman at the City Hotel , and today ...
And your husband , Margot ?
My husband ... my husband takes care of his business ... like yours !
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
You look like a hunter lying in wait ...
You &apos;re right , and there &apos;s the game I &apos;m waiting for .
I will tell you , on the night of my engagement with Florence , something mysterious happened ...
Florence had withdrawn on the grounds that she was suffering from a migraine ; her father and I , worried about her condition , moved up to her room .
Tell me the truth , Florence .
Do you love this man ?
I can &apos;t imagine Florence cheating on me , but the memory of that evening won &apos;t get out of my mind !
Go to Tiergartenstr . 245 , Villa Yquem .
You won &apos;t get it back until you get it with your own lips !
The Bible says don &apos;t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing .
I have to find out the whole truth , no matter what it takes !
But I must finally have certainty !
Bring me a neutral envelope .
I do not have a red light and I would ask you to advance me a small amount .
I don &apos;t know what to do !
Then at least allow me to wait here for my brother !
Trust me , he will pay for this , the scoundrel !
I need a power clot in five minutes .
I am pleased to see , my dearest , that you are quite comfortable without my company .
I will therefore no longer stand in the way of your pleasure ...
How long does it take to get from here to Tiergartenstr . 245 ?
You &apos;re making a big mistake , Mr. Yquem , if you neglect your wife so much !
Consul , master is not coming .
We must once again be alone !
Once and for all , the madam does not wish to see you .
That should be enough to change her mind !
Let him in .
Act as you see fit .
You have your destiny in your own hands !
You can reveal to the world whatever you want , but you will never make me break the fidelity I swore to my husband !
I apologize , but your extraordinary resemblance to an old friend ...
So this letter was also addressed to my brother Werner !
This is indeed my writing , but I have never written such a letter !
Do you know anything about what happened to your brother ?
I beg you , my lady , spare me any questions about my brother .
He will have perished in one of the countries where he roamed !
I know where Yquem lives ;
He has a very beautiful wife .
A Mr. Krafft is visiting the madam .
Pack the lady &apos;s suitcases .
She will leave the house tonight .
You are in error , Mr. Yquem .
Locked !
My poor friend !
I knew about all this and I have come to raise you up in this hour of destiny !
All women are like that !
Forget her forever !
No , I &apos;ll never forget Florence !
I have come to warn you , sir .
Your wife is in grave danger !
Florence ?
What ?
Florence is here ?
Your wife does not wish reconciliation with the offender of her honour , and will leave this house under my protection !
Indeed , Commissioner .
As soon as I noticed the switch on my ring , I rushed here to file a complaint .
But ... in my opinion , only one person could have made the switch , because this elegant , Mr. Krafft .
Mr. Krafft recently drove the automobile to Tiergartenstr . 245 .
No officers in uniform !
All in civilian clothes !
This is my brother , but he never told me anything about this !
Forgive me , Florence .
All my life and all my work is yours !
My only thought is you !
Florence , I do know that it is not worthy of me nor of you to ask you such a question , but have pity on me poor fool :
What happened on the day of our engagement ?
I do not want the shadow of suspicion resting on you !
I &apos;ll take all the blame !
So this is where you hang out , son ?
Don &apos;t you want to say good evening to an old friend like me ?
We have caught the thief , but who is the murderer of the dead man lying out there ?
He &apos;s innocent !
He killed him to protect my honor !
This ruby belongs to the jewel collection stolen from the Duke of Axminster .
How did it come into your possession ?
On what day was the theft committed ?
If so , I can prove my husband &apos;s innocence .
I can teach him an alibi using my diary , which I keep in the conservatory .
Werner !
Praise be to God who brought you here !
Now you can testify that I told my husband the truth !
My guilty conscience crushes me !
If you were to leave me , I don &apos;t deserve anything better !
I love you , Harry , and I will wait faithfully for you until your guilt is atoned for , just as I have been faithful to you until now !

Greetings , Shepherd !
Greetings , welcome and rest .
I swear you &apos;re a guy , all like Jánošík .
How .
What &apos;s the landlord ?
Like who ?
Like Jánošík , who lived here before ... !
He has little concealed what awaits him at home after two years of torture and learning , to come home to visit his parents .
Too much work !
Praise be ... !
The long journey has exhausted me .
Would you give me some water ?
Cheers .
Cheers .
This is our neighbour Anka .
Yes , Anièka !
Pišta .
It was two years ago !
Not so fast - the kiss still burns - the moustache was burned .
Don &apos;t go yet .
Oho !
Only through the cloth .
Known excuses .
The friend and protector of Jánošík .
I haven &apos;t seen my father and mother yet , how are they ?
Are they healthy ?
Dear Father , where is Mother ?
Mother , dear mother !
Old Jánošík was out of work again !
My wife is dead !
She wasn &apos;t going to jump off the chest when you were in the fron .
Fifty sticks !
Get Jánošík , they beat his father !
Do they have a certain , they , they ... !
Good thing the monk is here , they &apos;re saving for the funeral !
- And they beat him so bad he died that day .
In the village .
Into the front !
Into the front !
Think about it , listen to me and you &apos;ll never have to go into the line again !
Haunted by the henchman , Jánošík hid in a cave .
My mother , my mother , behind two mountains , my head hurts when I cry for her .
Praise be .
Thank you , Anka !
Never !
Don &apos;t go !
I thought there was no one here who would take care of my parents &apos; graves .
But you ...
Anka , you angel .
No , Anka , I &apos;m not going to be a priest .
The cursed reign obstructs my path .
Now you will not escape from me !
We &apos;ll catch him and get the reward for a hundred ducats .
The unwanted witness .
I swear they &apos;re wrong sometimes , sir .
I am not a priest yet , and I will never be one .
This dog and Šándor robbed me of everything and drove me out like an animal !
Is it you , Jánošík of Terchová
Is it really you ?
Welcome !
I am Hrajnoha , the captain of the Forest Brotherhood .
And we almost forgot
Punishment
Yes , up the grove , down the grove , up the grove leads a path , my father very well , and I must be a robber .
Guys !
Here .
- Jánošík - new friend , become our captain .
Long live Jánošík !
Long live the new captain !
I was supposed to be a priest but the devil changed my plans .
Do you want me to be your new captain ?
Well , I guess .
I promise that I will be your just leader !
And as before , I will protect the subjects .
I will help him , with money or otherwise .
Our will - our power .
That all our work is for the welfare of the people .
Serving masters take everything from us - property , freedom , life - we will not spare them !
But we will not kill , do not forget !
Death doesn &apos;t change anyone .
Long live Jánošík !
Long live the new captain !
The walls of the Count Šandor preserve the silent witnesses of the nobleman &apos;s ample life .
There are many types of nobles there .
The Hungarian is a nobleman .
In the neighboring dominion .
They &apos;re going on a visit .
His nobility
- Baron Révay .
What a surprise .
His nobility , will they pay your debt ?
Oh yes !
Yes , I just paid my bills .
How many more times do I have to remind them of the 5,000 gold pieces ?
Ch will expose her .
That &apos;s what they get from the old ones ?
It &apos;s wine !
Now they &apos;re going to sell me barrel ?
How to sell ?
I &apos;ll give it to them .
But , you don &apos;t have to make such a fuss , I &apos;ll buy it .
Believe me , on the honor of the nobleman , if the harvest were in the barn , I would pay right back , but so , where to take ?
And the peasants ?
Could they pay back their debt ?
What am I supposed to understand ?
How ?
Every farmer should pay 50 pennies , if he does not have , he should give goods !
The Jew buys it , and they have the money in hand .
So my brother , arrange for the coachman not to strain the horses , I will stay until tomorrow .
It is announced that your Lord Count Šándor offers his subjects 50 cents each today !
If you don &apos;t have the money , you should pay the tax .
Whoever resists should be stumbled and thrown into the dungeon !
Give me back the pots !
You &apos;re supposed to give up the tax and I have nothing .
Dan couldn &apos;t pay her to work .
And what the hell am I going to do about it ?
In a moment .
But that &apos;s cheap .
Numbers ?
For the tax , I come myself in the afternoon .
Your advice has been brilliant .
And we &apos;re even .
Take my advice next time .
I have to go to the village .
And you , Hrajnoha , take Baron Révay !
For the subject there is no rest on Sundays .
Van will keep his word .
The daughter doesn &apos;t have anyone here , right ?
I don &apos;t want you slaving away in this dump . I came for you , you &apos;re coming with me to the castle .
Do be smart , you &apos;ll be better off in the castle .
O thou shy narrow-minded , be not defiant , and forget this robber quickly .
And this robber is here !
So here &apos;s the nest of the robbers , huh ?
But you can &apos;t escape us !
You coward !
You &apos;ll feel this coward !
Under the roof of the paternal protector .
Father , help me save Anka from Šándor .
Son , what path are you on ?
O Father , they do not judge me , they understand my miserable soul , the tortured people !
Oh , pity !
Be the father of my Anka !
Jánošík took care of the poor subjects , he helped them through the Terchová pastor and other secret friends .
In the evening at the parish .
What did the men of Šándor take , you can &apos;t give back .
But send Jánošík a pair of ducats .
The conference at the gentleman &apos;s .
Now the Hungarian master is not the master of his peasants ?
Should he tolerate the robbers telling us what to do and what not to do ?
Now , do you know what happened at the last Graff ball ?
Before midnight ... if the pleasure was at its peak ...
They take the subject , I take you .
And every sin you commit is punished !
You read my father to death !
You stole everything from him !
Remember you will not escape my revenge !
Well , and we shall tolerate that !
That &apos;s not right !
I assure you , gentlemen , that I will purge your gaff from the robber .
Here , Commissaire , I will provide them with the army .
The trap is set .
And the mistress is hiding in the church ?
Where did the mistress hide ?
And you stupid old man you give the robber money to the peasants , huh ?
The Lord will chase you from the priest !
I &apos;ve reconciled with everything .
Well , old man , don &apos;t you have wine for the guest ?
Yes , Grandma !
No robber has fallen in love with you , has he ?
What brought them here , how shall I serve them ?
I came for confession .
But now you will confess to me !
Does the robber come here often ?
He &apos;s not coming .
Why don &apos;t you get the girl ?
Why ?
Why ?
So she can tell us where the robber is !
I don &apos;t know !
You also know where he is !
Say it , you old fool !
You don &apos;t know !
Stupid !
Jánošík !
God help us the soldiers !
Gone !
Gone !
Saw it Michal , saw it !
Till the house shakes .
In the meantime , the Meirhof .
Look out , guys !
Draw the guns , get ready and go after me !
No !
Jánošík , we can &apos;t lose you !
I &apos;ll go first !
In the hands of the Lord , Jánošík surrenders you !
Eternal peace .
- The verdict ...
Since the accused and his companions , who have already been punished , have been guilty of crimes involving many , he has cheated , robbed , and murdered , therefore he is sentenced to death !
That the verdict be an example for all others , Jánošík is condemned to this guilty verdict :
You shall be hanged alive on your left waist , and then divided after death four , the guilty verdict will be executed without delay .
And so ends Jánošík , the first fighter for the freedom of the people of Czechoslovakia .
Thank you .
Goodbye !
THE END
Let go !
Enough !
I don &apos;t want to hear any more !
It disgusts me , horrifies me !
And yet ... I , who conceived it , hatched it in nights , in nights ... ah !
You don &apos;t know !
It &apos;s a game to you , angry , which is what life willingly offers you .
But me !
A thirsty one !
One , close to the veil ... hounded , hounded , tormented by torments that ...
Ah , hell , what nature gave me with this mug and this hump such a feeling , such greed ... oh , please , quiet !
The Order Keepers are up and full of ambition .
Behind the doors lurking , bribed , the servants ,
- there are minions in the gardens .
You exaggerate , my friend .
There are too many scruples out there .
The fact that we are not content with peasants and maids and grocers and happy girls is a sign of our taste .
What was the poem you gave us a few weeks ago ?
&quot; Beauty be prey to the strong . &quot;
&quot; All the splendor of the earth succumb to the power of the mind , &quot;
&quot; ... and the need for glory shine brighter . &quot;
&quot; ... and penetrate deeper , more heartfelt into the souls . &quot;
&quot; ... than that glitter that only blinds the eye . &quot;
- Very true !
- That &apos;s what you said .
- And ever since ...
- What you work , you report .
Flee ourselves !
None of those secret parties said hello to you .
Because a couple of dads wrestling hands and a couple of mothers sobbing heartbreaking !
Just don &apos;t think the beautiful ones themselves are angry with us .
Yesterday Alissa , the little Jew , was the eyes she made !
And the lovely daughter of the poet &apos;s biparetto , truly , she was delightful !
We &apos;ll take her from the arms of her dearest , everyday complaining .
The husband , inexperienced in the heart of love , does not weep tears the incomprehension !
From narrow rooms to wide mystical rooms ...
All fairy tales come to life , all dreams of silent nights ...
Dreams of the morning , they come to light !
What no one confesses and yearns for , it has come true !
Quite right , quite right ... it &apos;s persuasive .
But on one point , forgive me , I &apos;m not entirely right .
You always speak only of yourselves , of you who are well-dressed and gifted with grace , and forget about me , the cripple .
Come to the feasts as you desire , he will ruin them , and instead of the lust , the horror would fall .
You overestimate , my friend , so it seems to me , the beauty of women .
There were early nights .
It dances in with the windows open .
All humid spells , floral smell , heavy and numbing .
And I had to leave , shaken by fever , out in lonely alleys .
And was looking for a harlot , a depraved one .
Told her , offered her gold , much gold , and yet felt like the beggar who was cheating on charity .
In the light of the lantern , she must see my poor figure with a look ... a smile ...
so shameful that the blood is in my veins .
The gold worked !
On makeup lips , his gliding reflects all my misery terribly miserable .
Unflattered words were granted , but I lacked the strength to spell on myself and desecrate Lenznacht .
My Lord , the notary .
- Man , Alviano ...
- You are capable of ...
What &apos;s the notary doing ?
Don &apos;t worry .
I ask him to be patient for a little while .
So what ?
What are you doing ?
I forgot to trust you .
My island Elysium , with all its buildings , water games , and prancing gardens , with all its unprecedented wonders of art and ever since &apos; ne treasure ,
I gave it to the city as a gift for eternity .
You &apos;re out of your mind !
Don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing !
The work of your life !
You spent half your fortune on it , wasting it carelessly ...
Tomorrow night , after the burglary of the demon , in the presence of the high senate and the podium , with great crowds .
I give it to all the people .
Gentlemen , you are loaded .
Yes , but man , do you forget ...
You &apos;re turning us in !
Access to the underground room ... if you are afraid of discovery , avoid it in the future .
But now forgive me .
The gentlemen of the Council are expecting , and with the notary I have yet to determine the donation of words and paragraph .
- Hello !
Vitelozzo !
- I &apos;m late .
- We &apos;ll know !
- And out of breath !
You friends ...
What &apos;s up ?
I &apos;m stunned !
Sancta Maria , what happened ?
- Taken ...
Oh , God !
Unselfish !
... of so much beauty !
- Oh !
- I thought so !
- A woman !
- Of course !
- No !
- A goddess .
- An angel .
- A flower .
- We know that .
- I beg you , be quiet !
Where did you see the beauty ?
I rode past the Municipium , driving to some inn or festivity in the city , fathers in golden carriages .
If not ... what do you mean ... in the same one , so listen ...
My greetings , signori , and thank you for appreciating my plain house for visiting such illustrious guests .
Your plain house ?
O noble Signor Salvago , you are too modest .
The splendour of the rooms we walked through truly does not have their equal in Genoa .
Your praise gives me joy .
But let me say :
Here , my friends , blossom Genoa &apos;s knighthood , you read the names of illustrious sexes .
And here is my only child , my dear daughter Carlotta .
I &apos;m afraid , Signor , you may find too much free sense .
She respects me very much , very little of society &apos;s norms .
Convincing your highness and a very special request that she asks of you ...
But now , as you please , we , delegated by the High Senate ,
Bring to you thanks and joyful amazement of the high assembly .
Your letter from yesterday kisses us a gift , so great and important , so unexpected and rare in these times .
It &apos;s hard for a citizen to keep his purity .
Under his hands the gold rips , painfully acquired , and still the taxes and burdens multiply .
We wore it , patiently , and rarely mumbling , but as the home of our family , Holiness and faith in the Madonna .
But then it breaks into the herd like a wolf , robs us of women , steals our daughters , powerless , helpless ...
But forgive me , Lord , for complaining of our sorrows is not the purpose of our show .
The first ray of light after fearful days , thank you !
Eilland &apos;s lucky name , we take it as a good omen .
Do you remember , Signorina , a rider this morning , when she saw the gold carriages , she shouted .
The Duke Antonio Adorno ... the right of objection ...
We are addicted to ...
What can he do ...
The rider , however , looked in two flashing eyes , forgot if it was confused , blinded , restrained the horse and almost worshipped the beautiful woman with an open foot .
- I had a lot of fun .
- You are cruel .
And what if , falling off a horse , broken arm or leg ... is it not worth a look in my eyes ?
I would gladly give my life for you , but ...
What if that &apos;s what I wanted ?
You are so great , so powerful and strong , so high above me ... I have to stretch out , see , just look you in the eyes of such victorious eyes .
And I would like to see you small and low and poor , deep beneath me , reach my feet ...
The dead are poor .
But dead and mute .
And I love the soul that wrestles and torments itself , sacrifices itself and suffers for Minnelohn .
Once you &apos;ve died , what use is my love to you ?
You are the devil , virgin !
The answer ... I want to consider it
And give it to you tomorrow .
Stop , Vitelozzo !
What &apos;s your hurry ?
- Listen !
- We &apos;re in danger !
He delivers us from these lousy people !
- The entrance to the underground room !
- By the Madonna ,
- We have to stop it !
- so let me !
Talk to Adorno !
Do what you want , leave me out of it !
- But you ... one word !
- I know nothing , I want nothing , I &apos;m in love , I love ...
Do you hear ?
The plague in you !
That &apos;s the way it is , you &apos;re going to miss a day .
The senate requests the Duke &apos;s approval .
And tonight you are my dear guest .
Like you now mine .
I ask the noble guests not to spurn my invitation , a simple meal .
Signorina , your arm !
You &apos;re delicious ,
- Signor Alviano , no really ...
- So you &apos;re better now ?
I was terrified , you suddenly grabbed your heart
- I guess I feel like a fish in the water .
But doesn &apos;t my father tell you anything about a request ?
Yes , indeed .
You forget such important things so quickly ?
- No , but ...
- Well , look ... in front of so many people , it wouldn &apos;t have worked !
And since all my blinking , stealing waving , my asking if you didn &apos;t have a painting , a rare sculpture , showing me nothing , I fell for it ...
You have to think of me as a klutz , a lifeless , simple and silly .
But seldom do I blossom in dealing with beautiful women ... so it &apos;s that ... do you understand ?
I get it .
But listen now .
I paint .
Yes , indeed , do not look so surprised .
I paint pictures .
Animals and people , trees and lakes ... the sky , the light ... but I like to paint souls .
And can you do that ?
I mean , can you paint souls ?
I don &apos;t know if I can do it , and if I can &apos;t , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s always up to me .
It &apos;s so hard to find the models .
Just once , it seemed to work .
The picture was so miraculously fine .
Just an ugly shadow between the chin and the mouth ...
Look , there ... and however I swore and struggled , he would keep coming back .
Already I believe him gone and forever banished , there , unmistakenly , sneaking out of the brushes
I gave up the painting .
I haven &apos;t tried anything for a while .
But you ...
I &apos;d like to paint you .
Me ?
All devils , are you mad ?
That &apos;s right !
That &apos;s how it &apos;s got to be .
If I thought you &apos;d take me seriously , you &apos;d be different from the others , the serpents with soft faces , with curly eyes and hearts like devils .
But I just realized it : the same look .
For God &apos;s sake , remember !
Perhaps as a fool in a painting among beautiful gentlemen and women , effective as contrast , with a cap and a pair of bells , the hump didn &apos;t go well with the mockery of people , immortalized forever !
Silence !
Don &apos;t forget you &apos;re talking to a lady .
You &apos;re wrong .
Hear me out !
Where the city goes far and the view opens up to the Campagna ,
I have a little house as a workshop .
Early in the morning , when lonely and empty , the alleys and places , the pale light of the early morning , faints the canvas ,
I think it &apos;s the right time to go to work .
There &apos;s a path past my cottage , lined with high cypress .
You know him .
You walk it often
shy and bent over , lost in thought ...
Suddenly , suspiciously , the windows whose curtains were covered by the scouts .
But you didn &apos;t see them .
Then rose , purple blazing , veil shining in a thousand colors , glowing mist , like ghostly heralds , moving their Middle Ages ahead : the sun ...
And a second miracle happened :
I saw the poor little wall raise his head .
Each muscle tightened tightly in the thin body .
Arms raised , raised up to heaven .
So he stepped into the last , towards the sun .
And I saw him grow taller and taller .
My heart was pounding .
That &apos;s how I painted you , Signor Alviano .
This is how I painted your form :
walking towards the sun .
But I still lack the face , and I still lack the drunken eye ,
in it all the beauty is reflected .
I &apos;m ashamed ... I don &apos;t know ... forgive me ... I &apos;ve never felt so bad in my life !
Do you want me to finish the painting in my workshop ?
I &apos;d like to come .
He plays with us like a cat with a mouse .
He has become too powerful , the High Lord !
His last victory over Branciforte went to his head .
The people have spoiled him .
- After all , it owes him thanks .
- It pays him .
A noble mercenary , nothing more .
- What &apos;s the score ?
He didn &apos;t speak out .
Not for and against .
On the one hand it is gratifying for Genoa &apos;s people , on the other hand the nobility must regret if a valuable piece of ground is lost to them .
His heart speaks for the people , and in his favour .
Cheaper , however , and considerate of his friends , he should be careful that he should consider it and discuss it and speak the same phrases .
He &apos;s very jealous of the gift .
The whole story disgusts him .
The man of the day is Alviano Salvago !
The whole town praises his name .
My daughter Carlotta , not easy to conquer , often spoke of him , unaware of his nature .
Now he &apos;s won them in the storm .
May the Duke Adorno beware !
May he beware , Duke Adorno !
Did you hear ?
- The mood is bad .
- Are you worried about the pack ?
You spoke differently yesterday .
Yeah , yesterday ...
Don &apos;t remind me !
Do you talk to your friend like that ?
I &apos;m sorry .
But isn &apos;t it enough that I despise myself ?
Shall your mockery make my wound and my friends laugh at me and make me mad ?
What about you , Tamare ?
I don &apos;t recognize you .
The most brilliant gentleman of my court , honored as no second ,
loved , idolized by women , always in a good mood for the greatest pranks .
There are people who see only light , and the dark is alien to them .
That &apos;s who I was .
Life seemed to me a birthright of joy , from which I drank with thirsty strokes , carefree , without reason .
When I knighted my hand , I held the rose , sucked its fragrance and ravaged the blossom .
If I let myself fall , I fell on moss , avoided thorns and sharp stones .
When a friend complained of sorrow and pain , I heard him , but did not understand him .
And now , all of a sudden , I have experienced all the torment of hell , humiliation and disgrace .
Explain yourself clearly .
Wonderful and beautiful as the day , yet uneven to me ...
- a bourgeois child .
- Well .
And then what ?
When I first talked to her , I don &apos;t think I understood her .
She treated a sacrifice as a pledge of my love .
But what she desired ...
Unbalanced stuff , insanity , born of the moment , I struggle to figure out rules of polite custom .
After one night , waking in battle , I believe I found it and I swung on a horse , free and proud as a god , with noble feathers swelling my chest .
And rode through the city , sunk in dreams , I formed the advertisement and saw the beautiful blushed , stunned and moved by the high honor !
A Count Andrae Vitelozzo Tamare beats heart and hand ...
You really are crazy .
Be patient , Duke !
When I stepped in front of her , like the first time , I was already affected by Zagen .
Her strange look , her cool smile puzzled me .
But in order to salvage my petty heart , I made myself proud , riding up and rough , talking about the sacrifice I would make her , worse than self-mutilation and death ...
And since I happily got her &quot; no &quot; ,
Throw me down to her feet , of all my goods and rich treasures I stammer wildly mad words .
I beg her forgiveness and mercy .
Tamare , grab yourself .
You hear , Vitelozzo ?
Who is this woman ?
The Podestina &apos;s daughter , Carlotta .
Ah !
A great painter once told me her name as that of a rare talent .
I would warn you , for some reason , if I did not know how vain such an act , and how he hates the warner who loves unhappy .
So I &apos;d rather help you than guess .
Ah , if you could ... I &apos;ll promote you .
You don &apos;t know this woman .
But I know women .
So I hope for you .
But promise me this :
If the message is bad , and I return empty-handed , do not be angry against you and me , be strong , do not despair , throw it behind you , and forget this woman !
Listen , Duke , I want to forget her .
I want to forget her .
But only until she was mine .
Till the breath of her mouth I drunk in me , until those hands are soaked by the scent of her hair , until this woman , she will not be my wife , my whore !
That would be bad blood !
We are bound by law and order like all the others .
Don &apos;t forget that .
My friends sent me here to ask you :
You may prevent Alviano &apos;s Island &quot; Elysium &quot;
- Take possession of the city .
- All devils , what does Salvago have to do with your wicked pranks ?
Magnificent subterranean rooms , specially designed for love festivities ,
Make up an artificial caves on that island .
When you enter the cave , your eye glitters with a blue glow .
Heavy vines confuse your senses , lights about to draw reddishly twitching flames , distant music and quiet singing you deeper and deeper .
Over an abyss a narrow climb leads to the entrance of the cave , dense rose enclosures hide it from your eyes .
But if you discover the secret of the cave , we are lost .
And does Salvago know you &apos;re up to this ?
Salvago , haha !
A game of nature , if you will , a strange mood .
Genoa &apos;s ugliest man is the creator of adventure ,
of this reality of beauty .
And he himself ...
He keeps himself away .
Probably regretted it .
But I don &apos;t get it .
The light of the torches gilds everything .
In the orgy , the orgy gets ugly , and the beauty gets ugly .
The opposites disappear in a frenzy !
And this fool Salvago , after he bred on his bottom swamp blossoms of vice , poison weed of sin ... he gives it up , and himself , and you ?
He warned us .
Yet did not consider how hard to contain passion , once unleashed .
This is my curse : your inadequacy .
Your wild brunch is forcing me to do deeds that I condemn !
I want to save what &apos;s left to save .
What I promised you , I will keep , because your love separates you from the circle of criminals and because we have been friends since young days .
But beware , Vitelozzo , you are warned of violence .
Salvago may put a stop to his donation range for a long time .
He will submit , the people &apos;s favorite , or woe to him and woe to all of you !
Our time is full of strange things .
I knew a woman , she learned to paint at the same school , she painted hands .
Fine , slim , with delicate blue veins , coarse , bony men &apos;s fists ,
The ringing hand of a woman , lush and tender , with nails , pointed and rosy , blinking like drops of pale blood .
One hand I saw , clawing tightly into blossoming flesh , and another , plucking with gentle fingers out of green bushes , a rice terribly .
But the strange thing was a picture :
A hand , pale and waxing like a dead man &apos;s , with very long , scrawny fingers ,
... a little cramped , something you didn &apos;t see .
Only a faint purple glow seeped through the spooky fingers , but this bill was like a silent lawsuit ,
like oppressed , crying and screaming and acting and dying ,
like a behavioral cry for redemption ...
But the meaning of the picture ?
The poor girl has probably never felt what excites the artist for great deeds :
Love &apos;s happiness , or longing for such .
She probably had a secret fear that she might have had a powerful event on her way to life , some sensational spell that she succumbed to .
How strange , fear of happiness ?
The driving force of this poor life was greed for glory , and the source from which it drew was suffering .
Not mentally , a physical condition .
Your hand , Signorina , is not as calm as your voice , do you want to paint ...
No , no !
You &apos;re wrong !
My hand is very still , and the story is about to end .
My friend has had a heart condition since she was a teenager .
That &apos;s what you wanted to beat too much , and sometimes you felt like a hand grabbing a hard , unforgiving hand after the twitching thing and cramping it up , horrible and woe ,
Let it come to rest !
She has this hand , this cruel hand ,
and painted her pain .
And whether you deny that you are moved , it was close to you ?
I loved her .
That &apos;s how she died ?
I think she &apos;s still alive .
And tell me from your youth , or why you are so gloomy and in such a bad mood today ... or why your gaze so frightened flees mine !
What have I done wrong , are you angry with me ?
Signorina Carlotta , if this is only a game , what you are doing , desire to dance or even worse , you are , despite your sweet face and your voice , who sounds like a message from heaven , a devil !
Why should I , who am good to you , be as corrupt and bad as you describe me ?
I beg you for everything , just don &apos;t be angry with me !
Just be patient with me .
I don &apos;t understand , it &apos;s like a dream and I &apos;m afraid ...
Ah , fear not !
You are a man and so completely without faith in yourself .
Is it so unthinkable that a woman would find herself in warm affection , in friendship with you ?
Haha !
The old story !
But the way you look , with eyes whose lights alone promise ...
And when your mouth smiles , it seems to me as if there is nothing on earth that means &quot; friendship &quot; , as if that word , this miserable consolation word were an ingratitude , a lie and disgrace !
And if it was more ...
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s ...
Shouldn &apos;t in this vast world , among millions of beating hearts , find one that sought you in love ?
Me ... me who hates himself , who flees , who banishes the mirrors from the rooms he inhabits !
Fool who you are !
And who , like hardly a second , clings to what escapes as quickly as a May day :
the little beauty that leaves us women when the first furrow appears in the face !
As soon as we are aware of the frost , the fruits become blossoms .
The leaves wither and fall off .
And that would be the only thing ?
On sunny days , you never went out , depressed and sad , but you knew why ?
And the most glorious man , the most blooming tree , do not escape your anxiety .
And another time , on rainy days , never made you warm and happy , yes , happy , a lonely old man , wrinkled and ugly , who walked along the way and looked at you with faint eyes ?
But what if on a dawning day in a bed full of beautiful flowers you could find some hideous beast in your mood ?
I can only see one thing :
You dodge me , as you used to , with glances , now in words .
But I must tell you .
Carlotta , consider ... you should know ,
I love you .
Carlotta !
For God &apos;s sake , Signor , what eyes you make .
There you have my hands and kiss them quickly !
But let me go to work .
I need your eyes in my image .
That &apos;s all right with me .
Carlotta !
Beloved !
I beg you , do not speak
and only looks at me so fully and lower your gaze deep into mine and thinks of many beautiful things that I am your sun , that scares away all dark things from your life with radiant light .
For God &apos;s sake , Carlotta , I need to step on your feet .
I &apos;m so unspeakable , so incredibly happy .
Please , stay .
And just look at me and remember that you will no longer be lonely and unloved despite your ugliness .
See how calmly I say it , the word that tormented you for so long .
It &apos;s over now .
Because it &apos;s a word ... and a term ...
Nothing more .
But you must be good to me , Alviano , and tender , my love !
Because I &apos;m a frail toy .
Carlotta !
Well , now it &apos;s done .
Now come and support me .
I &apos;m exhausted , but you have to ...
For all the saints ...
Beloved , what is it ?
You sweet , you poor ...
You beauty !
You gave me life , faith in God and humanity again .
I want everything I have to tell you .
I want to spread myself under your feet .
I want infinitely good and I want to be gentle with you .
Mistress !
The Duke Adorno !
The Duke , what can he possibly want ?
I &apos;ll ask him to wait .
I &apos;ve been hearing voices everywhere since yesterday .
In the air , singing and grumbling in the bush ...
Earlier , Carlotta &apos;s silver laugh , but that was probably a deception .
Oh , Lord , how I have been since that day when you first entered my house , transformed and happy !
How is your daughter , now my wife , so unspeakably glorious , so mild and beautiful , so full of deep spirits .
But you are silent .
What about you , Podestal ?
I &apos;m confused and blinded .
What you just showed me , it is so unbelievable , that a single human brain was able to cast out this realm of spell !
A lot of people helped me .
The artists worked .
I just gave the longing .
- But where is Carlotta ?
- Come on , let &apos;s go find them .
Didn &apos;t you hear ?
They are looking for you , Donna Carlotta , and you hide , flee back into the shadows .
Oh , don &apos;t think ill of me , Duke , I don &apos;t even know what &apos;s wrong with me .
When I gave you my &quot; no &quot; yesterday for Count Vitelozzo , I felt big and strong and strong and happy .
And yet , ever since I finished the image you liked so much ,
the image of Alviano ,
I feel like something &apos;s gone to sleep in there , like my love isn &apos;t the same .
Not poorer , understand me .
But as if he had now given me his everything , his supreme , and I had nothing to expect ... nothing at all .
And then ... but I don &apos;t know if a woman feels dizzy about your participation and doesn &apos;t wake you up to mockery , duke ?
I pray you , trust me , how are you real and true ,
Signorina !
I entered this island in secret fear .
As if I had drunk wine , heavy and mixed with bewitching herbs or that strange potion , brewed from the heart of a lovely virgin !
It is beauty &apos;s horrible spell , bound , half-hidden to the senses , and now unleashed , revealed to the day , and lustful eyes like a glorious woman , shameful cloaked in the years of longing , suddenly reeling in naked ,
Unfolding a thousand charms in front of the loving young man &apos;s happy eye !
O Duke , who knows life , and women , you have sinned against Alviano , but even more him himself , because now , as I saw him , here , with my father , in all this splendor ,
which he created with his spirit blazing power , as I saw him , the poor man who tore the gracious veil himself into our pity and the strange power that bends the senses , I heard a word that the wicked man spoke in his happy hour :
&quot; But if you , on a pining day , &quot;
&quot; ... in a bed full of beautiful flowers , &quot;
&quot; would find some hideous beast ... &quot;
- My God , virgin ...
- Leave me , Duke !
Calm down , the only happy hour , you said it yourself , he owes it to you .
This may comfort you .
Don &apos;t comfort me .
I want no mercy .
Torment and hatred are what I deserve , despair and death !
So hear one last one .
He was not worthy and worthy of your love .
He is not the noble one you think he is .
He is obsessed with evil desires and yet today he is struck ... I don &apos;t want to hear it .
You want to slander him , but he is good and tall and sublime , and I am wretched , rejected and evil .
I hate myself and the world and you .
Only the night ... this night I love and their shadows .
So , God bless you .
But come on , I &apos;ll take you to your father .
Go , go !
But leave me alone !
Ah , what night !
What a blazing summer night !
I want to crawl deep into her blackened light , dive deep into her shining darkness !
With stars I dance the summer night songs , but with goblins I sleep in the bush .
Ah , what night !
What a blazing summer night !
Ah , what night !
What a blazing summer night !
With stars I dance the summer night songs , but with goblins I sleep in the bush .
Ah , what night !
What a blazing summer night !
Where is she , my bride ?
Nobody saw Carlotta ?
What are you running away from me ?
No , I &apos;m not fleeing you .
That &apos;s how you know me ?
I don &apos;t know who you are .
But if it were someone who loved you , most beautiful ?
You love me ?
It &apos;s good .
But let me see through your mask , whether your eyes are bright or cloudy .
Are you Alviano ?
No , you &apos;re not .
Beautiful of shape , a handsome boy .
O most beautiful Carlotta , how you speak strangely !
Strange , my darling ?
Give your hand , ah , it &apos;s soft and warm , and it feels comfortable .
There , you can feel my heart beating hard !
To you , my sweet !
But listen , boy , with your hands , so soft and soft , you hold it gently and must not torment it , you hold it tightly , very tightly and quietly .
Come on , sweetheart .
- The night and the morning are near !
- Sweet is the night
- Feel my heart beating .
- O let us hurry , the night is short and the morning is near !
- To you , my sweet !
- To you , sweet one !
I can hear your voice !
It sounds to me from heights , from hips , a thousand times !
Song from the air , a mockingsong from the depths of hell !
Her form dances before me , lies out of bushes and hedges , and there and there her dress glitters like a moose , rushing me , uphill and talented , in the ether , in the swamps ... and I held her , yes , she was mine !
Or wasn &apos;t she ?
- High Alviano Salvago !
- Who gave us the joy !
Bringer of beauty !
Father of the people !
What do you want ?
Silence !
I &apos;m not a king .
A fool , a cripple !
A beggar , a monster !
Where &apos;s my bride ?
Hey , get her !
I want to thank you .
I &apos;ll give you everything I have .
Then I am Frst , a king , a God !
Get Carlotta !
I want to thank you !
Then I am Frst , a king , a God !
Up Alviano , Apollo !
A friend of the Muses !
Crown him , the king !
Where do you have the crown , the rosary crown ?
The friend of the people , lift him up !
Crown him with roses !
Up Alviano !
Let , let ...
Hold on , Genetic people !
Hold on , bewitching !
Madmen who are you !
You crown him who robbed your daughters , seduced your children , desecrated , perhaps murdered !
What &apos;s that ?
What does he mean by that ?
Eight !
Terrible !
Him ?
- Alviano ?
What ?
Don &apos;t believe him !
Aha !
- Alberghi .
- The foxes !
- It &apos;s clever !
- The fucking envy !
- Slander !
- Up Alviano !
Be quiet !
Silence !
Listen to the eight !
Through the Holy Eight , I , Duke Adorno , the people &apos;s protector and true friend , bring the charges against the knight Alviano Salvago .
I &apos;ll show him the maiden robbery , the seduction , the desecration , committed by the wicked virgins ,
- the dome and seduction to such .
- Wasn &apos;t there a scream ?
Did you not hear a scream ?
By virtue of our power as judge and true justice , we extend the charges against the knight Alviano Salvago and show him possessed by the evil spirit , possessed by Satan and evil demon violence ,
the bewitching of the people .
We cast a spell on the island &quot; Elysium . &quot;
It shall be destroyed by fire , as an incubator of the vice and the devilish sin .
Knight Salvago , you are ...
You see , this is what it comes down to !
- We &apos;re being robbed !
- Do not give us joy !
Cursed robbers !
Beasts !
- Down Adorno !
- Death to Alberghi !
Kill them , the scoundrels !
- All lies !
- Defend yourself !
- Alviano , talk !
- We believe you !
We &apos;re with you !
Alviano , talk !
We &apos;ll protect you !
Towards you , sweet one !
- Don &apos;t you hear ?
Music ...
- Feel my heart beating !
Short the night and the morning are near .
Cimbles , flutes , harps ... and wild singing ?
You see , he is possessed , the demon speaks !
Alviano , man , your life is at stake .
He &apos;ll be embarrassed .
Take him away !
Stop !
Don &apos;t touch him !
We believe him more than you speak .
He did us good .
If you want him , give us proof .
Proof !
Bring that child .
Explain yourself , Ginevra !
Ginevra Scotti !
For heaven &apos;s sake , let me go !
Say without fear , Ginevra Scotti :
Where were you hiding before you , helpless , fled to Duke Adorno ?
At the house of Alviano Salvago .
- Listen !
- Listen !
Quiet !
Who &apos;s that ?
- Listen !
What are you standing there for ?
What are you guys doing ?
Old man , be merciful and let me go !
It dawns on me , terribly clear and clear .
Say without fear , Ginevra Scotti :
Who was it that robbed you of freedom and honor ?
A nobleman who called himself Menaldo Negroni .
Aha !
The Alberghi !
Look !
- Listen !
But what about Salvago ?
Out with the truth !
Old man , she &apos;s in danger , I can see the connection !
The head of a horde of evil men , noble robber , is Alviano Salvago .
The Duke told Vitelozzo Tamare everything .
Who said the name ?
Who ripped it out of my brain ?
That &apos;s him !
He stole them .
He stalked her .
He was courting her . I know , I know ...
Are you crazy ?
Ginevra stole Count Vitelozzo ?
Who &apos;s talking about Ginevra ?
Who is she ?
I know nothing about her !
Carlotta !
Oh , you dog !
You pervert !
You animal !
If I had you , I would tear you to pieces , beast , with my teeth !
Come , I &apos;ll lead you .
Do you see the blue note up there ?
Do you hear ?
Listen !
Isn &apos;t it music ?
Great and wicked , screaming and yelling ...
People of Genoa !
I will lead you to your disgraced daughters .
To my poor lost bride !
Then I will speak to you and you shall judge .
But woe to the others !
Don &apos;t you dare !
Death over her !
You &apos;re lying !
You are mistaken . I am speaking the truth .
Listen , it could be that she didn &apos;t wake up ,
that she slept over into the world .
And look , it was so much for me .
I didn &apos;t have anything .
In my whole life , this woman was the only great thing , the only beautiful thing .
Understand when you say to me :
&quot; I have robbed them , taken them by force , &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t help it , because I loved her ... &quot; &quot; so I must hate you , and curse you for destroying a poor man like me , taking away what he had .
But in there , deep down , something like that would remain , understand me , like a mere consolation .
But if you tell me :
&quot; She has given herself to me , &quot;
&quot; She , Carlotta , voluntarily , in love , &quot;
&quot; &quot; and she was happy , &quot; &quot; yes , truly , &quot; you said &quot; happy , &quot;
Well , then ... then I didn &apos;t have anything , then you didn &apos;t take anything from me , then I &apos;m just as miserable again ... as I was ...
Pushed back into nowhere ...
And if you murder me , I don &apos;t know anything else to tell you .
Only one thing :
This woman , from the first day I saw her , had fallen in love with me , after the word you said to yourself , Alviano , once said :
&quot; Beauty be prey to the strong . &quot;
You thought you were strong for an hour , but you weren &apos;t .
The joy presented itself to you , and you jerked off , trembling and cowardly .
You saw only the dark , the shadows , danger and sin .
All scarred by fate , you were fleeting , unfree , despondent .
For your kind , the precious flower lives only in dreams , but it blooms bright and enticing in the day , remember dream , illusion , nocturnal haunting .
Because , Alviano , didn &apos;t you say Carlotta , too ?
What didn &apos;t you take ?
Because ...
O devil , do not ask that before you go to hell ,
So horrible ...
Because I look into the depths you don &apos;t know , because I &apos;m human , and you ?
Don &apos;t know who looks deeper from both of us .
Don &apos;t know what &apos;s more valuable :
A joyless life , a slow one , or a death in high and clear , in deep embrace , a blessed death !
How am I feeling ?
The meaning of your words , that &apos;s not possible ... her lips begged for rest , mumbling the ancient song of fearful defense .
But her eyes begged for pleasure .
Out of her mouth came an excruciating confession , fear and horror ...
But in the eyes , wildly ruthless , the sparks of lightened desire were sparked .
Finally , there was a break :
Bigger than you , she made herself free .
The glittering dance in the laughing eyes joined her wildly drunk lips :
&quot; &quot; Give death , &quot; her eyes shouted ,
- &quot; Give me luck , &quot; greeted her word .
Terrible !
Knowing you , Unsel &apos;ger ...
Just roll your eyes , grab your teeth and clench your fists !
My most blessed hour , no one will rob me of it !
Say a prayer .
You have nothing on me , what do you want ?
On a church sanctuary a hunchbacked fiddler who played in a fine manner .
The most beautiful of the beautiful , that was his sweetheart .
I took her out of the dancing swarm and carried her away .
He fell after me , so he stood before me like that , distorted , distorted and full of hate !
I killed him with his fiddle .
Just come to me , with my hands I will kill you all !
So die , villain !
Who screamed ?
Wasn &apos;t that ... my darling ?
No , no , look at me , Alviano ...
Carlotta , beloved ... I &apos;m with you , he lied , lied , lied !
Away , away !
An algae !
A night face !
Help !
Hu , how that pushes !
And the red light !
Woe , woe !
Give me water .
No , give me some wine .
And my sweetheart shall come , my beautiful , sweetheart I want Vitelozzo , before I die ... I want to , I want ...
Yes , where &apos;s the fiddle ? I &apos;ve got to go to the church dedication .
And my cap , my beautiful hat ...
Red and with silver bells .
Did no one see the cap ?
Let me , I have to ...
Wait ... what was that ?
There &apos;s one ... you good people ,
There &apos;s a dead man lying there .
A presentation from a cultural and historical perspective in moving images in seven chapters .
BENJAMIN CHRISTENSEN wrote the book and produced this film between 1919 and 1921 .
For the photography I am grateful to Mr. Johan Ankerstjern and for the artistic direction of Richard Louw .
My main sources are called in the film program .
Let us look into the history of mysticism , and try to bring clarity to a mysterious chapter known as the Witch .
The belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind .
When primitive man is confronted with something unexplainable , the explanation is always magic and evil spirits .
In Persia , the fantasy creatures depicted in the following picture were believed to be responsible for disease .
The English scholar Rawlinson and the French scholar Maspero show us pictures of evil spirits believed to be native to the oldest cultures .
The belief in evil spirits , sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naive notions of the secrets of the universe .
Here we see how the Egyptians imagined the nature of the world .
( According to Maspero )
The ancient Egyptians believed the high mountains surrounded land and water from all sides .
The sky was made of steel , held by strong arrows that stood on the highest mountains .
The stars hung like lamps on ropes from the sky .
According to the beliefs of other historical cultures , the sky was vaulted and the earth was designed in users .
In medieval folklore , the evil spirits of the past became devils who sneaked around and seduced children .
The devils lived in the core of the earth .
In the later Middle Ages , the Earth was considered a fixed sphere in the center of the universe .
Above the earth and its waters -
- people in the Middle Ages imagined a layer of air -
- then a layer of fire -
- and outside the fire were the planets , moving heavenly bodies .
Each planet was bound to its transparent , moving track .
Outside the planetary pathways , the fixstars stood in their own sky
Above all , in a tenth crystal rink , sat the Almighty , surrounded by angels &apos; vows , and he was the one who kept the world machine going .
Deep down in the core of the earth lies hell , where the temptation of the devil should suffer for eternity .
In the upper part of the following picture ,
( from French historian Lacroix )
The devils stuff the damned in big pots .
A sinner is thrown directly into the fire that burns under one of the cauldrons .
A devil pours the disgusting sulfur through a horn seeping into the throat of a man .
Two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth .
I have found a peculiar mechanical image of hell that provides a good understanding of faith in the Middle Ages .
See with what zeal the devils take care of the fire under the cauldron !
During the Middle Ages , the Devil and Hell were believed to be true and constantly feared .
Witches , it was believed , closed a dishonourable pact with the devil , and that is why they were burned .
The floating figure is a devil who comes to fetch the witch by lifting her up into the air .
This picture of a pyre , as well as the following , are from &quot; German lives of the past in pictures . &quot;
In this picture , a witch milks an axe handle .
In the following picture , a witch has bewitched a man &apos;s shoe .
Witches usually meet in circles .
After the gathering , for example , they snuck into a stable and bewitched a cow .
The tiny tiny symbol under the picture was usually carved into the stable door as a protection from witches .
In this old , naive drawing , a sorcerer and a witch , throwing curses , set fire to a city .
It was believed that witches use powders and magical potions of wizards to punish people with diseases .
Notice that the sick person is lying naked in bed .
It was common then .
It was common belief that witches danced naked with the devils at night , during the so-called witch &apos;s sabbath .
Women who wanted to take part in this &quot; Sabbath &quot; snuck up on the magician
where they could have their backs smeared with &quot; witch &apos;s ointment . &quot;
The magic of the ointment allowed them to fly through the air .
The French doctors Bourneville and Teinturier gave me the following images of the witch abbess a secret satanic rite that thousands of women declared their involvement in .
During the Sabbath , witches and wizards first performed a desecration of the Holy Cross of the Church .
Satan gives devil names to all involved .
And a ceremonial feast was held .
Sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows .
All witches had to pay their respects to the devil by kissing the butt .
After a merry dance with the devils , the witches flew home with the first cock scream .
Such scenes are often found in familiar images of witch &apos;s sabbath from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance .
To be continued .
EXAN Chapter 2
We are now going to an underground home of a sorceress in the year of the Lord 1488 .
&quot; Tonight the stars shine favorably over the gallows hill . &quot;
&quot; Uhh , what a stench !
The thief &apos;s body hung too long on the gallows . &quot;
&quot; If such a thief &apos;s finger has dried up too much , it can no longer give the brew healing powers . &quot;
&quot; Hurry up and open up , Karna , so the passersby can &apos;t see me . &quot;
&quot; Karna , can you make me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church ? &quot;
&quot; Here young maiden , have a drink of cat droppings and pigeon hearts , boiled in the moonlight . &quot;
&quot; A drop of it in a man &apos;s drink will soften his heart immediately . &quot;
&quot; Karna , can I have an even stronger potion ? &quot;
&quot; If the maiden wishes to rob the man of the senses , for love &apos;s sake ... &quot;
&quot; ... I made a potion in May by a young and playful male swallow . &quot;
&quot; Keep your money , pretty lady !
Smell my ointment first ! &quot;
&quot; This ointment is good , if you want to travel to a chunk one night . &quot;
&quot; Sneak the ointment on it , and the monk of God will come to your chamber at once . &quot;
&quot; You will fly high together at night and he will give you many hungry kisses . &quot;
&quot; Listen brother , should we not pray before we begin such an audacious scheme ? &quot;
&quot; O Holy Mother of God , forgive us for opening this dead body with a knife ! &quot;
&quot; It is not the inappropriate curiosity that makes us sin so badly ... &quot;
&quot; ... but that this way , the cause of many terrible diseases will be revealed to us . &quot;
&quot; Help !
Quick !
The peace of the cemetery was disturbed by two witches . &quot;
Such was the Middle Ages , when witchcraft and devil &apos;s work were sought everywhere .
And that &apos;s why strange things were thought to be .
&quot; Damn woman !
You shall not lie here bewitching the legs of respectable people . &quot;
&quot; Watch out !
Now let your dirty mouth stand open forever . &quot;
So it was with witchcraft and the devil ;
People &apos;s faith was so strong that it became .
The devil is everywhere and takes every form .
He shows himself as a nightmare , angry demon , seducer , lover and knight .
The devil &apos;s companion can be young and pretty , but more often she is old and ugly .
Is it the eternal fear of the stake that you get drunk every night , medieval woman ?
When the night bell rings and all the fires of the city are covered in ashes , the devil takes Apelone for his adventures .
High in the air is Apelone &apos;s dream castle , and there the devil will grant her all her secret wishes .
To be continued .
EXAN Chapter 3 .
In Franz Heinemann &apos;s &quot; The Judge and the Justice of the German Past &quot; , we can see pictures of the inquisition judges at work .
A woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out if she &apos;s guilty or not .
Edward Fuchs shows us in &quot; history of vice &quot; how the defendant is bound .
Two men let the defendant into the water with straps where she has no support .
When it swims , it &apos;s pulled up and burned .
When they sink , the judges thank God for their innocence .
I will now present a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end , which took place when the Pope sent traveling inquisitors to Germany .
&quot; My husband could not suffer from dizziness so suddenly if he had not been bewitched by a sorceress ! &quot;
&quot; Be comforted Anna , wife of the printer , the power of lead will reveal it in a moment . &quot;
&quot; Oh , you mighty Saturn , allow this lead to show whether Jesper is bewitched by the printer . &quot;
&quot; It is written here in the form of lead that the dizziness is cruel witchcraft . &quot;
&quot; Oh , Peter , look , where is the evil sorceress ? &quot;
&quot; You may see the witch sooner than you care to ... &quot;
&quot; ... sooner than I &apos;d like . &quot;
&quot; Jesus &apos; Holy Cross and wounds !
I didn &apos;t hear you come , Tubin Maria ! &quot;
&quot; Oh young woman , have pity on me , a poor woman who has to go from door to door begging ! &quot;
&quot; Are you hungry Maria ?
If so , sit down . &quot;
&quot; Here , eat if you can , in the name of Jesus . &quot;
&quot; Watch out little sister , watch out .
This woman has evil eyes . &quot;
&quot; The youngest servant of the Inquisition does not speak a word to a foreign maid . &quot;
&quot; How wonderful !
It felt like fire when the young maiden touched my arm . &quot;
&quot; Young woman , are you aware that what you are accusing this woman of threatens her life ?
&quot; Swear by the cross that you are not mortal enemies ! &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s go , young man , before her feet lift off so that the wicked witch does not turn us all into mice . &quot;
&quot; Now you will have the hot death you deserve , you damn servant of the devil ! &quot;
To be continued .
EXAN Chapter 4
Two &quot; honest &quot; housemaids move the defendant in prison so she can &apos;t carry hidden witch powder .
&quot; Maria the Weaver is accused of witchcraft . &quot;
&quot; Master , look closely , there could be witch powder hidden in the sorceress &apos;s hair . &quot;
The nights of the accused are now dictated by the inquisitors .
Two respectable men trying to get her to confess .
If she stubbornly denies her guilt , they will use some kind of mental torture .
&quot; Woman , look at the seven holy words of the crucified Jesus written on blessed parchment .
&quot; I hang it around her neck so that the devil can no longer help her keep quiet . &quot;
&quot; Does she see this length of blessed wax as the corpus Christ ? &quot;
The defendant is led backwards into the torture chamber so that she cannot bewitch the judge when she enters .
&quot; One last time I ask :
Will she confess her witchcraft and misdeeds ? &quot;
&quot; Let their suffering begin so that we can put an end to the hardness of their hearts . &quot;
&quot; Oh , scholar !
How am I supposed to confess something that wasn &apos;t ? &quot;
&quot; So then , executioner Rasmus !
Let the evil witch &apos;s body hurt . &quot;
&quot; Let her breathe , executioner Rasmus , and at times , solve the screw when she confesses her sins . &quot;
&quot; Oh scholar !
I confess I gave birth to many children to the devil . &quot;
&quot; And when I gave birth to Karna and her entire coven ,
&quot; If I am spared the pain , I will confess that Trina smeared me with witch &apos;s ointment . &quot;
&quot; Oh , learned man , I have flown worthless men through the air at night , on Trina &apos;s broom for scraps . &quot;
&quot; And the devil &apos;s grandmother was there with all her sorcery . &quot;
&quot; And a woman who didn &apos;t do enough evil was cruelly treated by the devil . &quot;
&quot; And many spit on everything that is sacred . &quot;
&quot; And a meal of toads and unbaptized children was cooked by Karna . &quot;
&quot; Listen , Tubin Maria , did you see the devil put his mark on the forehead of the witches ? &quot;
&quot; Oh scholar , I saw the witches kissing evil &apos;s ass . &quot;
&quot; And Anna &apos;s mother , the printer &apos;s wife , who wished me a hot death ... &quot;
&quot; - That damn woman , I saw her kissing the bad guy so tenderly ... and Sissel , her servant , the old fool , was there too . &quot;
&quot; And Elsa , who kicked me some time ago , she &apos;s supposed to burn at the stake .
&quot; She walked past Martin &apos;s door on a moonlit night with her sister . &quot;
&quot; And they put a curse on Martin the scribe with the water they threw at his door .
&quot; And it was the same night that Martin died and took the scribe . &quot;
&quot; And now I &apos;m going to tell you all about the witches who screamed after me in the street where I live . &quot;
To be continued .
EXAN Chapter 5
In this way , the wheels began to spin endlessly in the age of witches .
Every witch accused ten other witches .
The city supervisors were busy .
If you oppose the arrest of a witch , you have to be one yourself .
The fate of young Anna , the printer &apos;s wife , is sealed .
So there are only two people left in the haunted house of Jesper the printer .
In the witch age , it was dangerous to be old and ugly , but it was also not safe to be young and pretty .
&quot; Brother , help me .
I have sinful thoughts . &quot;
&quot; Expose your body , brother ! &quot;
&quot; I will whip your sinful body and your poor soul for health . &quot;
&quot; Oh brother , why do you stop hitting ?
Now my soul is surely damned . &quot;
&quot; Father Henrik , brother John is enchanted . &quot;
&quot; A witch came to his cell to seduce him . &quot;
&quot; And she grabbed him by the wrist . &quot;
&quot; Stand up brother , Father Henrik is coming . &quot;
&quot; Brother , you didn &apos;t give up virginity for a witch , did you ? &quot;
&quot; Do you know the punishment for those who refuse to testify against a witch ? &quot;
And so they will take you , young maiden , and submit you to their infallible test .
&quot; In the name of the Holy Trinity , if you are not a witch , you now forget tears ! &quot;
&quot; See for yourself - you cannot cry because you are in league with evil . &quot;
We now assume that the young woman resisted ;
that no threat and no pain can make them confess .
I was trying to figure out how the extraordinary inquisitors behaved under such circumstances .
And I see some scenes here that I don &apos;t think are too dark for the screen .
&quot; Wake up young maiden !
I bring you great joy . &quot;
&quot; Look young maiden , I give you freedom if you do me a small favor . &quot;
&quot; Why do you mock me , monk ?
What can a poor creature like me give you ? &quot;
&quot; Teach me the fine art of making thunder with this water ! &quot;
&quot; If you don &apos;t believe me , young maiden , stand up and look at the court . &quot;
&quot; Did the guards leave ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , they are far away .
The keys are in my hand now and I can secretly get you out through the city gates tonight . &quot;
&quot; And I swear to keep quiet about everything you reveal to me about witchcraft with thunder . &quot;
&quot; Think young maiden that Jesper the printer &apos;s child &quot; is all alone in the world with no relatives except you two ? &quot;
&quot; Oh Father Henrik , look at the tears of the young maiden .
Look , she &apos;s crying , so she can &apos;t be a witch . &quot;
&quot; Silly boy , don &apos;t you know that witches secretly smear themselves with saliva to make us think they are tears ? &quot;
&quot; Here maiden , see the boy who perishes without you as a dishonourable , outcast witch offspring . &quot;
&quot; Stay here and listen to all the words of the maiden so you can testify against her later . &quot;
&quot; Will you secretly open the prison gates for me and the child when I talk ? &quot;
&quot; Then I will tell you that once a wandering stonemason told me ... &quot;
&quot; ... that when witches call for thunder , they put their hands in the water ... &quot;
Before the sun sets tomorrow , you will burn at the stake . &quot;
&quot; And then they will burn you too , maiden ,
&quot; for the uplifting of men , as a sweet fragrance for God . &quot;
And one pyre after another burned in the city until one day the judges moved to the next town .
The witch madness raged like a spiritual plague wherever these judges appeared .
Within a few centuries , over 8 million women , men and children were burned as witches .
To be continued .
EXAN Chapter 6
There are witch confessions that are totally crazy .
Many women confessed , for example , that they turned them into cats - defiled the altar that night , while two devils woke up in the form of animals at the church door .
But there are also confessions that may well be close to the truth , at the time of superstition .
Many women have been burned for confessing to having &quot; tied the knot &quot; on a wedding bed !
With every lump , a pregnancy is destroyed .
And the happiness of an entire house could be destroyed with witch hair and metal crosses .
Many women have probably done such magical tricks and believed in their destructive effect .
But if we go after the confessions , we need to take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber .
You and I would also be forced to admit mystical abilities with the help of such instruments .
Or not ?
The French doctor Paul Regnard describes how this collar was used .
The collar was attached with four ropes .
The defendant &apos;s ankles and wrists were tied to two bars attached to the floor .
When a fire bowl was placed under the poor victim -
- his movements were so intense that the tip of the collar pierced his neck .
Doctor Regnard shows another picture that speaks for itself .
It &apos;s just &quot; after the questioning &quot;
The &quot; painful interrogation &quot; began preferably with &quot; lighter &quot; torture :
The thumbskin , for example .
One of my actresses insisted on trying the thumbscrews when we shot these pictures .
I &apos;m not going to reveal the terrible confessions I made to this young woman in less than a minute .
In the monasteries in the Middle Ages , fear of the devil escalated into almost hopeless despair .
The meek have committed many unfortunate self-punishment .
Often only a single nun was affected and suddenly the whole convent was affected by madness -
- a mysterious , contagious madness .
In writings that have survived to this day , these unfortunate women have written with touching simplicity as the devil penetrated the monastery .
&quot; Get away from me Satan ! &quot;
&quot; May all the saints help me !
Sister Cecilia conspires with evil . &quot;
How must these women have suffered before their nerves broke out and madness broke out ?
Their biographies contain this desperate exclamation :
The devil forced us !
&quot; Oh , holy mother , evil has a terrible power ! &quot;
&quot; Look at me now , he &apos;s forcing me to do what I least want . &quot;
&quot; Burn me at the stake of pious father !
Don &apos;t you see what the devil is forcing me to do ? &quot;
&quot; Take me !
Don &apos;t you see him ?
The devil is standing over there threatening me . &quot;
To be continued
EXAN Chapter 7
Let &apos;s leave the devil &apos;s obsession
( speaking in foreign tongues and cramps )
And come to this time .
Most of the old witches were poor women ;
Those that are accepted today by pious organizations or nurses &apos; homes .
One or more traits that made an old woman stand out was enough to bring her to justice at the time of the witch prosecution .
Let &apos;s not believe that the devil belongs only in the past .
The dear old woman who plays the tweaver in my movie once while on a spin , raised her tired face to me -
- and said , &quot; The devil is real .
I saw him sitting on the edge of my bed . &quot;
With her consent , I showed her a prayer book in a woman in 1921 !
)
She thinks she can see the devil through her eyes .
The delusion of the witch can be described as nervous exhaustion that I want to explain here .
I want the audience to know that in the event I have the same actress portray different patients with related nervous disorders .
I personally knew a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep .
Why did she keep doing the same thing she was most afraid of ?
Like a witch driven from the devil , this woman , when she was asleep or awake , gave fire to the mysterious desire to light matches .
Did this obsession have anything to do with her fear of dying of fire after one broke out in her house ?
She said she felt like she was fighting an unknown force , stronger than her own .
Isn &apos;t there something &quot; witchy &quot; about this sleepwalker sneaking through the dormant household with her matches ?
Does she not remind us of the nun walking through the chapel with her knife driven from the devil ?
This poor woman , even in a confused state , does what she fears most in her sleep .
This obsession - these somnambulls , dazed writings - fits with a mental illness we call hysteria .
And there are even more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person .
We remember , for example , that the witch was visited by the devil at night .
Today it is not the devil but rather a famous actor , a popular clergyman or a well-known doctor who disturbs the peace of the night .
The hysterical person will no doubt say that these celebrities came through the wall or the window .
See how consciously this unconscious woman clings to her bed .
A person suffering from hysteria always shows some artificial peculiarities .
In the Middle Ages , it was believed that the Devil had brought the witches to the body of invisible times , where all their emotions disappeared .
The executioner often found numb spots on the defendant &apos;s back .
&quot; I clearly see that you are a witch .
You don &apos;t even feel the Master &apos;s instrument on your back . &quot;
Today , this strange numbness is considered a symptom of hysteria .
&quot; No , I don &apos;t feel anything on my back . &quot;
&quot; Yes , as I thought , her daughter suffers from hysteria . &quot;
&quot; After what you told me , I have to advise you keep your daughter in the clinic for the time being . &quot;
&quot; It would be a shame if your daughter had an unpleasant encounter with the police . &quot;
Poor little hysterical witch !
In the Middle Ages , you were in conflict with the Church .
Now it &apos;s the law .
&quot; Please come to my office . &quot;
&quot; Or should I call the police ? &quot;
&quot; Your name ?
Can you identify yourself ? &quot;
&quot; Your address ?
Do you have a phone at home ? &quot;
&quot; Fine , thank you .
You can go .
I &apos;ll call you later . &quot;
&quot; When my family hears about this I &apos;m going to be forced away . &quot;
&quot; I ask you to understand that I am an unhappy , sick person .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t live with the constant fear of war .
I &apos;m a broken person . &quot;
&quot; It is as if an unknown force forces me to commit these terrible thefts . &quot;
&quot; Look here !
I just stole a little , costly Russian book . &quot;
&quot; What am I supposed to do with it ?
I don &apos;t know a word of Russian . &quot;
&quot; My husband died in the war and since then I have not been myself ... &quot;
&quot; I promise I won &apos;t pursue this further , but I have to ask you never to enter my store again . &quot;
Centuries have passed and the Almighty from the Middle Ages is no longer in his tenth sphere .
We no longer sit in the church and stare in fear of the devil &apos;s frescoes .
The witch no longer flies over the rooftops on her broom .
But isn &apos;t superstition still omnipresent ?
Is there a big difference between the sorceress and her clients then and now ?
We don &apos;t burn our old and poor anymore .
But don &apos;t they often suffer bitterly ?
And the little woman we call hysterical , alone and unhappy , isn &apos;t she still a mystery to us ?
Nowadays , we lock the unfortunate in a mental institution or if they are wealthy - in a modern clinic .
And then we can calm down with the idea that the hospital &apos;s mild-tempered shower replaced the barbaric methods of the middle-aged .

THE END
Orlc &apos;s hands
Ma &apos;am , it &apos;s nine o &apos;clock and the train will arrive at eleven .
To Montgeron ... !
He &apos;s alive !
It &apos;s 5 : 30 , Professor .
At 6 o &apos;clock Vasseur is executed ... and 8 minutes later the car will take the body to the hospital .
A train wreck .
Orlac is badly injured .
There is still hope ... a skull fracture that we will operate on ... but his hands ...
Save his hands ... his hands are his life ...
Save his hands ... his hands are more important than his life .
Save his hands ...
I &apos;ll try .
Just a little longer and you can come home ... and sun , light and lots of flowers will greet you when you come .
We want to give you back your husband ... partly , anyway .
Today , you should be able to see his face again .
Your eyes ... how I love your hair and your hands ... your beautiful , tender hands ...
There ... that head ... isn &apos;t it looking at my hands ?
He &apos;s laughing ... !
Now ... he &apos;s gone !
Tell me ... what &apos;s under those bandages ?
What secret are they hiding ?
Well , for heaven &apos;s sake , let &apos;s reveal the secret ...
Will these hands ever be able to play again ?
The mind dominates the hands ... nature and a strong will can overcome anything .
Tomorrow ... he &apos;s coming tomorrow !
I will wait for him here ... his first kiss and the first caress of his beloved hands .
Last night .
Your hands could not be saved ...
Dr. Seral has given you others - the hands of the executed robber Vasseur !
Is it true ?
Do I have the hands of the robber and murderer Vasseur ... ?
How much longer ?
Still half an hour ...
No , only 30 minutes .
These hands will never be allowed to touch another person .
How much longer ?
I love you ...
I love you ...
Do you have the paper from January 15 for me ?
I feel it coming from you ... along the arms ... until it finally takes hold of the soul ... cold , horrible , merciless .
Damn ... damn ... hands !
Don &apos;t come any closer !
Go away ...
I don &apos;t want to obey you anymore .
Tomorrow I &apos;ll go to his father if you can &apos;t convince him !
Don &apos;t touch me ... your hands hurt ... like the hands of a murderer ...
Take them away !
I don &apos;t want them - those miserable things !
The creditors
Just give us a little reprieve ... a month ...
I &apos;m telling you ...
They demand blood ...
Crime ...
Murder ...
Just a week !
The hands don &apos;t control the person ...
The head , the heart control the body ... also commands the hands ...
See you tomorrow ?
Hat and coat ...
I &apos;m going to see Paul &apos;s father .
He &apos;s rich ... he can help ... if he wants to ...
Don &apos;t go there ... he &apos;s a bad man ... he hates all men ... and most of all our Lord ...
I &apos;m not authorized to let anyone in ... last but not least someone from ... there .
Mr. Orlac - you know about the misfortune that has happened ...
Mr. Orlac - Paul can &apos;t play now .
That &apos;s why we got into trouble .
Paul doesn &apos;t know yet ... help us !
He is your son ... your flesh and blood ... would you let him become destitute ?
Yes , I do !
I hate him !
Mr. Orlac has to go to his father himself ... tonight !
How do you expect to pay madam ?
Dearest , one more night and one more day and then I will be with you again .
And I will feel your body shaking under my hands ...
Once ... that was ... my handwriting ...
Go to your father ... today ... he has to help us ... it can &apos;t go on ...
Murder !
The murderer &apos;s knife , Vasseur ?
The fingerprints of the executed vasseur !
Vasseur &apos;s handwriting !
I don &apos;t know what secret surrounds us ...
Vasseur has been dead for years , but his hands are alive !
Paul Orlac , you are your father &apos;s heir .
They &apos;ll bring me a million tomorrow .
At this hour , here !
Money ?
Money ?
And for that you persecute me in the guard and in my dreams ?
Why ?
For my hands !
Who are you ?
I am a vasseur , executed on July 13th ...
The same experiment Professor did with your hands , his assistant did with my head .
If I don &apos;t have the million tomorrow at this time ... the prosecutor will know the day after tomorrow who killed your father ...
Who &apos;s the killer ?
You ...
Paul Orlac !
The fingerprints that are visible everywhere are the prints of the vasseur &apos;s fingers , and who has these fingers now ?
Paul Orlac !
The letter that lured the old servant away from the house was from Vasseur &apos;s hand .
The knife with which the murder occurred is Vasseur &apos;s knife with the X.
Your girl will swear that she saw it ... in her hand !
Maybe you didn &apos;t commit the murder , but you won &apos;t be able to prove it ...
What &apos;s happening to me ?
Am I crazy ?
Don &apos;t you want to tell me what bothers you ?
I know it , I feel it , these hands leading me to crime ...
I have to bring him the money .
I &apos;ll tell the prosecutor everything ...
Who &apos;s going to believe me ?
They will believe you , as I believe you .
I come here a free man .
Stay there , maybe you have some news for the evening papers .
A strange encounter , so peculiar that I do not know if it is true or dream ...
A stranger .
It was him ... the one who was executed ...
I saw with my own eyes the sign of the guillotine on his neck ...
Mr. Orlac , thank you for your testimony ...
Go there tonight .
Bring the money to the stranger - we &apos;ll take care of everything else ...
An old acquaintance - Mr. Nera , last known medical assistant to Professor Serral ...
One of the most talented crooks in the world .
So I &apos;m a blackmailer .
But you &apos;re looking for a killer ... !
Didn &apos;t you notice that the murder was committed by Vasseur &apos;s hands ... ?
I don &apos;t have those hands ...
I want to tell you who has such hands .
Mr. Orlac , you &apos;re under arrest !
Mr. Orlac is innocent - Nera is the murderer .
Quiet !
Tell me , where are the fingerprints of the vasseur executed ?
Nera was Vasseur &apos;s friend ... he secretly made wax prints off Vasseur &apos;s fingers .
And then he made rubber gloves ... with Vasseur &apos;s fingerprints .
And so he killed the older Orlac ...
And he also killed the old moneylender and put the suspicion on Vasseur and Vasseur died innocent .
If Vasseur was innocent ... my hands are pure ...

PARIS IN SLEEP
One night Paris goes to sleep and the next morning the night watchman of the Eiffel Tower wonders why nothing moves in the city and no one comes ...
For the chief of police
At the Paris airport
&quot; Everyone froze last night except me at the top of the tower . &quot;
&quot; And us on the plane . &quot;
A thief is always useful .
&quot; Let &apos;s not give up . &quot;
&quot; I will see to it that the doors of the shops open for you and the doors of the Bank of France . &quot;
All of Paris is theirs .
But what good is wealth if you &apos;re bored ?
&quot; If anyone can hear me , meet me on Avenue de ... a handkerchief at the window ... &quot;
&quot; From here , the fatal ray was sent to put the whole world to sleep . &quot;
&quot; It was my uncle , Professor Ixe ! &quot;
&quot; You have to wake up the world ! &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t think so ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll try . &quot;
&quot; 3 : 25 , same hour ! &quot;
&quot; You betrayed me ! &quot;
&quot; We need to get some money with the help of your uncle &apos;s invention . &quot;
&quot; The whole world was asleep for four days . &quot;
&quot; You all tell the same story ! &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re all telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; Go tell your stories somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; Did we dream all this ? &quot;
&quot; No , it wasn &apos;t a dream ! &quot;

Considering the demands of the workers with the greatest possible care ... the management considers them impractical for the following reasons :
1 . The eight-hour workday is completely unlawful ... and does not depend on the management .
2 ) The pay rise ... 4 ) The right behavior .

A civil action of the management is recommended only if the workers comply unconditionally .

PART SIX LIQUIATION
In the factory district , a state liquor store was ravaged , looted and set on fire by the strikers .
The mass was scattered with water hoses .
The situation is tense , and there are other disturbances being feared .

Act One : &quot; Humans and Vampires &quot;
The spirit of the revolution hovered over the Russian country .
Some vast , mysterious process took place in countless hearts .
The individuality , which had only just recognized itself , rose in the mass and mass of the great spirit .
The sailors Matyushenko and Wakulintschuk .
We sailors of the Potemkin must support the workers , our brothers , and put ourselves in the first ranks of the revolution !
Heavy and gloomy is the sleep of the Guard .
Watchful , but awkward .
You take out your anger at the newcomer .
Insulting ...
Wakulintschuk
Comrades !
It is time for us to speak up .
What are we waiting for ?
All Russia has risen !
Should we be the last ?
In the morning .
Enough , we don &apos;t want to eat any more rotten stuff !
A dog wouldn &apos;t eat that !
The ship &apos;s doctor Smirnov .
It crawls overboard by itself !
They &apos;re not worms .
Those are dead fly vines .
You can wash it off with Sole !
In Japan , Russian prisoners are fed better than we are !
We don &apos;t want to eat bad stuff anymore !
The meat is good .
Don &apos;t argue !
First Officer Gilyarovsky
The faint fury boiled over .
The ship &apos;s canteen .
The sailors refuse to eat the borscht .
Our daily bread
Act Two &quot; THE DRAMA OF TENDRA &quot;
Commander Golikov
Those who are satisfied with the borscht two steps ahead !
The Maate .
Dismissed !
The rest I &apos;ll hang on the Rahe !
Guard on deck !
Under the pretext of letting them step out of line , Matyushenko is gathering the sailors at the turret .
To the tower ...
To the tower !
To the tower ...
Guys !
Go !
The majority of them were pushing the tower .
Stop !
Not one step further !
They tried to escape through the Admiral &apos;s hatch .
Back , canals !
The way is not for you !
I &apos;ll shoot you like dogs !
Cover with the Persenning !
Aye , aye , Persenning !
Cover up !
Look out !
Oh Lord !
Bring the disobedient to reason !
On the Persenning line !
Wakulintschuk makes up his mind .
Fire !
Brothers !
Who are you shooting at ?
The guns were shaking .
Shoot !
Shoot !
Shoot , you rags !
To guns , comrades !
Beat the dragons !
Beat them !
Beat everybody !
Fear God !
Get out of here , Chaldeer !
Down with him for the worms !
Comrades !
Victory is ours !
Bleeding to death , Wakulintschuk tries to save himself from the furious Giljarovsky .
Wakulintschuk overboard !
Save Wakulintschuk !
The first to call for rebellion was the first one to fall at the hands of the executioner .
To the shore .
Odessa .
A tent on the New Mole of Odessa - Wakulinschuk &apos;s last port .
A LIFE BORCHCHCHICH
Act Three &quot; THE DEAD SHOUTS &quot;
Out of the night came the fog ...
Rumors were coming from the mill .
And with the sun the news entered the city .
An armored cruiser on the Reede uprising shore ...
A murdered sailor ...
Always remember that !
A spoonful of borscht .
&quot; Citizens of Odessa !
In front of you lies the corpse of the sailor Wakulintschuk , brutally murdered by the First Officer of the Armorcruiser &quot; Prince of Taurien . &quot; Revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires !
Death to the oppressors !
The crew of the armored cruiser &quot; Prince of Taurien . &quot;
Eternal remembrance to the fallen fighters !
All for one
One for all .
Down with the hangmen !
Down with self-domination !
Mothers and brothers !
No difference , no hostility shall separate us !
Beat the Jews !
Shoulder to shoulder .
The earth - is ours
Tomorrow is ours
A delegate from the shore .
The enemy must be hit !
In league with the insurgent workers of all Russia
We will prevail !
The Potemkin is watched by the banks .
Fourth act &quot; ODESSA TREPPING &quot;
In those days the whole city was one with the insurgent armored cruiser .
Like a white swarm , the boats flew towards the armored cruiser .
And suddenly
Come on !
Let &apos;s ask them !
Listen up !
Don &apos;t shoot !
My boy is very bad
Cossacks !
Then the atrocities of the military leaders in Odessa respond to the armored cruiser &apos;s grenades .
Target - the theater of Odessa .
To the general staff .
Act Five :
Until evening the stormy meetings continued .
Odessa &apos;s people await their liberators !
Get ashore and the troops will join you .
It &apos;s impossible to land .
The Admiral &apos;s squadron is moving against us .
Unconsciously , they decided to meet the squadron .
A night of unrest broke out .
In the dark , the squadron crept up .
Hoarse from constant speeches breathing the throats heavy and stagnant .
Squadron on the horizon !
All hands on deck !
Ready for battle
Full speed ahead !
Brave face !
All ahead flank !
The Potemkin and Minenboot 267 .
The Admiral is attacking !
The squadron is approaching !
Give a signal to join us .
Join us !
Enemy in range !
All against one
One against all .
Fire ?
Brothers !
Over the heads of the Sarcist admirals , the fraternal hooray roared .
The red flag of freedom blew proudly and without a single shot , the insurgent armored cruiser passed through the ranks of the squadron .
Alaska &apos;s gold rush was a dream for hard-hardened people , and the siren of the North called many to her icy chest and unexplored areas .
The gold mines were behind the Chilkoot Pass .
There was misery untold .
Many fell down exhausted and died , others turned back , the strongest held out .
In the icy north , in the quiet nowhere , came a fearless , lonely gold prospector .
Somewhere in this nowhere was another gold prospector .
Our Columbus stumbled out into the barren wasteland , then he stopped , stumbled and slid .
&quot; Wait a minute , before I know where I am , I have to get there . &quot;
In the ice desert was a dream , a scream penetrated the dreary sky .
Eureka !
I found a pile of gold ! &quot;
But the elements laughed , roared and thundered !
In a lonely hut , Black Larson lived also alone , a miserable , predatory scoundrel .
The little guy stumbled into the groaning shed in search of shelter and hospitality .
He stretched the weary bones as icy wind whistled through the holes .
&quot; Come here , &quot; said Larson .
&quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
&quot; I eat , as you can see . &quot;
&quot; Get out of here ! &quot;
&quot; Come on ! &quot;
Get out !
The storm bothered Big Jim .
Jim was the noble guy , he &apos;d suffered .
Oh , he loved to suffer !
He suffered from everything .
&quot; Out ! &quot; said Larson .
&quot; Otherwise , it &apos;s lead . &quot;
&quot; Come on , get out of here ! &quot;
Get out !
But Big Jim couldn &apos;t stand that noise .
&quot; I &apos;m staying here , right ? &quot;
&quot; Here ! &quot; said Big Jim .
&quot; Yes , Mister , he &apos;s staying here , &quot; the guy said .
&quot; Is that clear ?
We &apos;ll both stay here . &quot;
They stayed for days while the cabin groaned .
And the men ran until the hunger tormented them .
&quot; I have to eat ! &quot; screamed Big Jim .
&quot; I have to eat ! &quot;
&quot; What are you eating ? &quot;
&quot; Nothing . &quot;
&quot; Open your mouth ! &quot;
&quot; Liar , you eat the candle . &quot;
&quot; She ? &quot; said the kid .
&quot; How disgusting . &quot;
&quot; If you &apos;re kidding , I &apos;ll slit your throat . &quot;
&quot; One of us has to go into the storm if we want to eat . &quot;
&quot; Come here . &quot;
&quot; We draw cards , the loser has to go . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s your turn , &quot; Jim said .
&quot; Bye , good luck !
Bring something to nibble on . &quot;
Somewhere in the middle of nowhere , justice was looking for Black Larson .
Hunger also plagued her on Thanksgiving Day .
But they had a reason to be grateful .
&quot; Not quite yet , two minutes ! &quot;
&quot; Come on , do it ! &quot;
The little guy searched everything , but couldn &apos;t find the slightest bite , not even a field mouse .
The agonizing hunger drove Big Jim into fits of hysteria .
He was a pain in the ass .
&quot; Food , food ! &quot; he thundered .
&quot; Another shoe roast ? &quot;
&quot; No , anything but that ! &quot;
Poor Jim couldn &apos;t take it anymore .
&quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
&quot; I thought you were a chicken . &quot;
&quot; Heat us up a bit . &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
&quot; Come here , birdie . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be childish . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be silly , it &apos;s me ! &quot;
&quot; You ! &quot; said Big Jim .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m crazy . &quot;
&quot; Who are you telling ? &quot; the guy asked .
&quot; I &apos;ll take the shotgun before you lose it . &quot;
Chicken or no chicken , that guy got Big Jim &apos;s appetite .
Meanwhile , Black Larson came across Big Jim &apos;s gold mine .
Then everyone went their own way .
Jim to his mine , our hero to his destiny .
&quot; Take care .
Nice to meet you . &quot;
Fraud awaited Big Jim at his gold mine .
Big Jim looked into Black Larson &apos;s eyes and saw the soul of a villain .
The pull of his misdeeds brought Black Larson down to deserved misfortune .
As in a dream , a city was born in the wilderness .
People filled them with life , love and lust .
Georgia !
Jack was a womanizer .
Georgia was impulsive , proud and independent .
She worked in the dance hall .
Jack had a lot of love for her .
That &apos;s what she resented .
Out of the night , the boy came into the light of pleasure , into the refuge of lost dreams .
&quot; Be nice to Jack .
I think he really likes you . &quot;
&quot; He likes everyone , &quot; Georgia said aloud .
&quot; It &apos;s all boring here .
I &apos;d give anything up for a decent guy ! &quot;
&quot; One day I &apos;ll find him . &quot;
She turned around and searched and searched and searched .
&quot; Pretty cheeky , &quot; Jack thought .
&quot; Don &apos;t brag .
We &apos;re dancing now . &quot;
&quot; Play something sensible . &quot;
&quot; I said we &apos;re going to dance . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; said Georgia .
To embarrass Jack , she picked out the most pathetic Tramp .
&quot; Hey , you , come here . &quot;
&quot; Yes , you .
Do you want to dance ? &quot;
&quot; You see , I don &apos;t dance with everyone . &quot;
Unscared , the brave gentleman protected her sanctuary .
&quot; If you want to catch them , put your hat on properly .
&quot; Here , take this . &quot;
&quot; Well then !
I &apos;m stronger than I thought . &quot;
Hank Curtis &apos; cabin was not far away .
Hank was a single engineer who occasionally went on expedition .
He was a good man , our hero was hungry , the beans smelled and the coffee steamed .
He found a way to get invited .
Big Jim recovered from Larson &apos;s punch , but lost his memory .
Hank &apos;s partner arrives .
A long expedition awaits them .
The guy &apos;s supposed to be guarding Hank &apos;s cabin in time .
&quot; Don &apos;t forget to feed the mule . &quot;
The boy hadn &apos;t seen Georgia again , but chance brought them together .
When she entered , the whole room shone , the music of romance filled his untrained soul .
When she introduced the group , his heart was humming .
They warmed up , he went to get wood .
That &apos;s when his secret was discovered , he loved Georgia .
The women giggled to hide their pity .
In her world , it was not advisable to show much heart .
They wanted to pick him up .
They sat in the twilight , their faces sprayed sassy , but his naive heart kept humming .
She was polished , flirting and petting .
He knew she was shagging but enjoyed holding his hand and smiling at him .
&quot; It &apos;s nice here .
I hope we can come back . &quot;
What was the big deal ?
He enjoyed her human warmth and the lady the warmth of his chair .
Then she left .
And with her , my love .
He was left with nothing but emptiness and his dreary , lonely existence .
&quot; Excuse me , but uh ... &quot; He lacked the words .
&quot; Did you mean that ? &quot;
&quot; But of course .
What do you think , girls ? &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re coming to the New Year &apos;s Eve party . &quot;
&quot; Done , we &apos;re coming to New Year &apos;s Eve . &quot;
Of course she had to forget her gloves !
He then pulled every lever possible to make New Year &apos;s Eve .
New Year &apos;s Eve - new hopes , new dreams !
Georgia charmed him with her tender smile .
The girls demanded a speech .
He was too happy .
The only thing that mattered was Georgia .
He stuttered and finally said :
&quot; Instead of a speech , I want to dance . &quot;
And so it came to the roll dance .
In case old friends are forgotten
And never be remembered
In case old friends are forgotten
From long past times
For the sake of the old days , my dears
For the sake of old times ,
It dawned on Georgia at the party that she had promised something .
&quot; Come on , let &apos;s visit the guy . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;ll be fun .
He &apos;ll be terrified . &quot;
&quot; Forget it .
Better take care of me . &quot;
Shortly thereafter , Big Jim tried to convince the authorities that he had discovered gold .
&quot; Where is it supposed to be ? &quot;
Big Jim had forgotten that .
He just knew it was at the cabin .
&quot; The cabin , exactly !
&quot; When I get to the cabin , I &apos;ll find the mine .
But I forgot . &quot;
&quot; Your friend Georgia is looking for you . &quot;
How dare this scoundrel mention her so lightly ?
Ready for a punch again !
But since he was underweight , he overlooked the insult .
Georgia had actually been looking for him and texting him .
While he was looking for Georgia , Big Jim was looking for him .
&quot; You there ! &quot; Big Jim shouted .
&quot; Just the man I &apos;m looking for !
&quot; The cabin !
Where is she ?
&quot; Answer , come on !
&quot; Can you talk ?
Tell me !
&quot; Where &apos;s the cabin ?
Where ?
&quot; I will find my gold mine .
&quot; On your feet , quickly !
&quot; You &apos;re coming with me .
Take me to the cabin and I &apos;ll make you a millionaire . &quot;
&quot; Georgia !
Just a moment , &quot; the little guy said .
&quot; You don &apos;t have to explain anything .
&quot; I will save you .
&quot; As soon as I get back , I &apos;ll be back . &quot;
Exhausted they reached the cabin .
&quot; The worst would be done .
&quot; Get the provisions . &quot; Tomorrow we find the mine .
Take a sip .
It &apos;s going to make you feel better . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s heavy , this lamb chop ! &quot;
As usual , fate mixed in , the elements laughed , roared and thundered , but our heroes slept deeply .
Then the morning ...
The guy woke up , he &apos;d forgotten the night , but he knew it was &quot; the morning after . &quot;
&quot; First , clean up and make breakfast . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve never had liver problems like this ! &quot;
&quot; Can you feel the swing ? &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s the stomach . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s not the stomach . &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s go over .
Let &apos;s see how far it spills . &quot;
&quot; Something seems to be missing underneath . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll take a look outside . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t get upset .
Don &apos;t move , don &apos;t breathe . &quot;
&quot; I said don &apos;t breathe , bonehead ! &quot;
&quot; You can drive a man crazy sometimes . &quot;
&quot; If you just stay calm , everything will be fine . &quot;
&quot; Evidence of character .
Where is your will ? &quot;
&quot; Listen . &quot; I got an idea .
That &apos;s how I can get out first . &quot;
&quot; Do you understand now ?
&quot; You have no idea about psychology , no self-control . &quot;
That &apos;s when Big Jim came across his gold mine .
&quot; Now we &apos;re rich .
We &apos;re going to be millionaires ! &quot;
And so it was .
They wanted to go home , away from the inhospitable Alaska and to Candy Land :
Live , laugh and indulge in luxury !
They were famous , the press enveloped them .
In their luxury cabin , they were hoarding them more and more .
The guy was supposed to tell his life :
&quot; From rags to luxury . &quot; He said yes .
Jim got manicured .
&quot; Not the nails , the calluses ! &quot;
The reporters wanted a picture in the old rags .
Because of humanity .
Georgia !
There she was - and no one knew about the other one .
Georgia heard about a stowaway .
&quot; She , &quot; she said .
&quot; I never thought it would happen . &quot;
She thought he was the wanted one .
They wanted to book him .
But Georgia was willing to pay for him .
&quot; He &apos;s a stowaway ?
That &apos;s Big Jim &apos;s partner , the millionaire ! &quot;
Of course they apologized .
The guy gathered and had the butler take care of the new guest .
&quot; Sorry , but who &apos;s the lady ? &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t say ...
Congratulations !
A great story - with a happy ending ! &quot;
And that was it .
A happy ending .

Sanctuary of the song lovers ,
The Paris Opera House rises nobly above medieval torture chambers , hidden dungeons , long forgotten .
Melody floats through corridors and corridors , even to the directors &apos; offices , where an extraordinary contract is made .
Now the seal of the notary , gentlemen , and you are the lucky new owners .
It is hardly possible that you can hear of a ghost , a phantom of opera !
The servant of Box Five will not laugh if you explore the opera spirit !
They are heavy , gentlemen !
We &apos;re not children !
Who occupies Box Five ?
I don &apos;t know .
I only saw the veiled figure of a man who hides his face and refuses to speak !
Is it the Phantom ?
The Phantom !
The Phantom is back from the cellars !
We saw him for a moment ... a gray shadow ... and he was gone !
He didn &apos;t have a nose !
Yeah , he had , she was huge !
This man came out of the basements ... shortly after we saw the phantom .
Could it be that he ... ?
Joseph Buquet really saw the Phantom !
Let &apos;s ask him ...
His eyes are horrible pearls in which there is no light ... like holes in a grinning skull !
His face is like leprosy parchment , yellow skin stretched tightly over protruding bones !
His nose ... there is no nose !
Watch out , Buquet ... ghosts don &apos;t like to be seen or mentioned !
Come on , I &apos;ll show you where I saw him ... in the backdrop of the third basement .
I saw him there !
A flash of shadow , and he was gone !
My daughter , Carlotta has been insulted !
You , the favorite rimadonna of the Paris Opera House !
Mademoiselle Carlotta ,
Christine will sing the role of the Marguritte on Wednesday night !
Any jealous attempt on your part to disrupt the screening will prove devastating to your career .
The Phantom
&quot; No ghost will scare Carlotta !
On Wednesday night you &apos;ll hear them sing ! &quot;
On Wednesday night , Mademoiselle was found
Carlotta is strangely ill and Christine Daaé sings &quot; Marguerite . &quot;
&quot; What do I hear that Christine prefers a mysterious admirer to yours , Raoul ? &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t worry , my dear brother - nothing shall disturb our love . &quot;
&quot; I have heard many rumors , Raoul - be careful ! &quot;
&quot; At least you made your dream come true , darling , and now we should be married . &quot;
&quot; I can never leave the opera , Raoul .
You must forget our love . &quot;
From a hidden place behind the changes , a melodic voice , like the voice of an angel , speaks to her .
&quot; Christine , tonight I laid the world at your feet ! &quot;
&quot; I have given you the full measure of my art .
You will win - all of Paris will worship you ! &quot;
&quot; But I warn you , you must forget all worldly things and think only of your career , and of your master ! &quot;
&quot; Soon , Christine , this spirit will take shape and demand your love ! &quot;
&quot; Call me whenever you want .
I &apos;ll wait . &quot;
In Mlle Carlotta &apos;s letter , another letter appeared , black-sided !
Mlle Carlotta if you appear tomorrow evening , you must be prepared for a great misfortune , and so I recommend you to be &quot; sick . &quot;
Christine Daae &apos;s friends are conspiring again !
But my daughter should sing tomorrow night , no matter what ! &quot;
My dear directors , the role of &quot; Marguerite &quot; will be sung again tomorrow night by Christine Daae instead of Carlotta .
P.S. If you refuse , you will show Faust in a cursed house .
Encouraged by her mother , Carlotta defied every warning and appeared the following evening as &quot; Marguerite . &quot;
&quot; So far , so good - for a cursed house ! &quot;
I can &apos;t explain it , but you must never intend to see me again .
- Christine .
Watch out !
She &apos;s singing to bring down the chandelier ! &quot;
&quot; Christine , I came to pick you up ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m ready , Master - waiting ! &quot;
&quot; Run to your mirror , my love - don &apos;t be afraid ! &quot;
&quot; Christine , it &apos;s me - your master ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t look under my mask - think more of my affection , which has brought you the gift of the song . &quot;
A dark lake , hidden by mankind and the sun , leads to the phantom &apos;s rendezvous .
&quot; I brought you here - five cellars under the ground - &quot;
&quot; - because I love you ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for this hour for a long , tired month ! &quot;
&quot; So what is good in me , brought on by your purity , could ask for your love . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s where I sleep . &quot;
&quot; It constantly reminds me of this other dreamless sleep that heals all illnesses - forever ! &quot;
&quot; You
- You &apos;re the Phantom ! &quot;
&quot; If I am the Phantom , it is because the hatred of humanity made me . &quot;
&quot; If I should be saved , it will be because your love redeems me . &quot;
&quot; People used to know me as Erik , but for many years I lived in these cellars , a nameless legend . &quot;
Another phantom tragedy
Christine Daae disappears
Opera singer mysteriously disappears after chandelier disaster .
The night passed - a night of indeterminate horrors - tormented dreams -
Christine .
My dear Christine , you are in no danger unless you touch my mask .
You will be free as long as your love for the spirit of Eriks overcome your fear . Erik .
Don Juan triumphant
&quot; Ever since I first saw your face , this music has sung to me of you and triumphant love ! &quot;
&quot; But listen -- there is an ominous undertone of warning ! &quot;
&quot; Enlighten your eyes - overwhelm your soul with my cursed ugliness ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , angry Christine , who wouldn &apos;t listen to my warning ! &quot;
&quot; If you love me as you say , then let me go .
I promise to be your slave forever ! &quot;
I will show you the depth of my love .
You may return to your world for now .
You can sing at the opera again . &quot;
&quot; But remember , you are mine - mine - and you shall not see your lover again !
If you do it , it &apos;s death for both of you ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , I swear it , I swear it !
I &apos;ll never see him again ! &quot;
Even though I gave my word never to see you again , I must .
I &apos;ll be at Bal Masque tomorrow night , but be careful , not alone ! &quot; Christine
Every year , in one night , the whole of Paris , regardless of the station , mixed up in the merry , foolish Bal Masque de l &apos;Opera .
In the midst of the festivities , a ghostly figure walked , dressed in red .
&quot; Under your dancing feet are the graves of tortured men , punishing the red death of your merriment ! &quot;
High above Paris on the roof of the opera !
Are we alone , Raoul ?
Can anyone hear what we &apos;re saying ?
I saw him , Raoul !
I saw the Phantom !
He &apos;s a monster - a disgusting beast !
You have to save me from him , Raoul !
Mlle Carlotta will never sing under the spell of his curse again .
Tomorrow I will take her place in Faust .
After the show , you have to take me away ! &quot;
I &apos;ll be at the stage door .
We will flee to England .
She betrayed me !
Not this way - this way !
That was the opera spirit !

At nine o &apos;clock the following evening , a mysterious carriage stopped on the circular side of the opera .
Wait for me at the west gate .
I heard his voice again , Raoul .
He knows our plan - everything . &quot;
Believe in my love , Raoul .
Save me from this monster - oh , save me !
My carriage is waiting outside .
We must leave immediately after the screening !
Dry your tears , sweetheart , and hurry -- you have to get ready for the show !
Come quickly !
Again the work of the strangler !
It was there !
I saw the body dangling in the air !
My brother -- poor Joseph , he knew too much about the Phantom !
The Pandschab lasso - the Strangler &apos;s noose !
Murderer !
Hide in the deepest shadows
- but I will find out about you !
Fear for his brother &apos;s safety brought Comte de Chagny to the opera house that night .
I think I can take you to Christine Daae .
- if you do exactly as I say .
Who are you to know the secrets of the phantom and reveal them ?
I &apos;m Ledoux from the secret police .
I &apos;ve been studying the phantom for months .
I found his hiding place deep in the torture chambers where he himself was imprisoned during the second revolution .
Keep your hands up - the strangler &apos;s noose wraps up quickly !
Your hands up - it &apos;s life or death .
The discovery of this trap door cost Joseph Buquet his life .
I &apos;m a messenger from the shadows
- Turn back before you perish !
You lied to me !
Do you think you and your lover can cheat the phantom ?
Ungrateful fool !
You spurned the spirit that spurned you
- the spirit that made you great !
Now you will see the evil spirit that makes my evil face !
No longer will I be like a toad in these lazy cellars secreting the venom of hate because you will bring me love !
We should be in his hiding place now .
We have fallen in the room of many mirrors the old torture chamber !
I am a man like other men I am not cheated out of my happiness !
Raoul !
Raoul !
My brother - where are you ?
It seems we have visitors .
Christine !
Christine !
Can you hear me ?
Your voice sounds close .
Try to find a door that leads to us .
Look at you - try to find out where he keeps his keys .
The visitors have left .
I have discovered the Phantom &apos;s lair .
- tonight my brother will be avenged !
Did you hear voices ?
Maybe we &apos;ll have more visitors .
Heat - unbearable heat !
Fools - do you think their minds have grown , Erik ?
What are you offering for their lives ?
Your answer , quickly - they can only survive for a few moments !
Gunpowder !
You have your chance to save him .
Will you be Eric &apos;s bride , or would you prefer to watch your lover die ?
When you turn the scorpion , you said yes and spared de Chagny .
Turn the grasshoppers and the opera house explodes into a thousand pieces !
I &apos;ll do anything you say , if you just save her !

CHILDREN
Saint-Luc , a village in the Oberwallis .
The house of the village chief .
On this spring morning , all those who are not prevented by hard work have been visited by misfortune .
The village chief , Pierre Amsler .
His son Jean .
His daughter Pierrette .
A neighbor .
The mother of the two children .
&quot; Where &apos;s Mama ? &quot;
&quot; She &apos;s going on a journey . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s just a shock , nothing serious .
A few days of rest and he &apos;s back on the mend . &quot;
Cannonicus Taillier , Vissoy &apos;s minister , was the godfather of Jean DUVAL .
And for Amsler , normal daily life went more badly than right .
It pained him to see children and the house so neglected .
&quot; ... and this torn sleeve ... &quot;
Every night Jean sent a thought to his mother .
When he looked at her picture carefully , it seemed to him that it was alive and smiling at him .
Like every Sunday .
It was Saint Martin &apos;s Day , payday for the rent .
Your daughter Arlette .
&quot; I can &apos;t pay . &quot;
&quot; My husband &apos;s fatal accident was allegedly in debt , so the insurance company paid nothing . &quot;
And it was spring again .
Amsler often passed Jeanne Dutois &apos; field .
The first Sunday in June .
&quot; Jean , my little one , I have something to do .
You go alone . &quot;
&quot; If you want , we can be married before the day of John . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m with my old friend , Father Porchet , for a few days .
How are the children ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m getting married again . &quot;
&quot; My house is empty , and no one cares for little Pierrette .
It &apos;s better for the children . &quot;
&quot; And Jean ...
Did you tell him about it ? &quot;
&quot; No , not yet . &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s so sensitive .
I think it &apos;s time to prepare him gently . &quot;
The next day .
&quot; You have something to talk about , I &apos;m leaving . &quot;
&quot; And ? &quot;
&quot; Could you not talk to Jean ?
I think you could explain everything much better to him .
He &apos;s a good boy , but so sensitive ... &quot;
&quot; I have an idea !
I &apos;ll take him to Vissoy for a few weeks and teach him how to do it carefully . &quot;
&quot; When he comes back , things will have already taken their course and he &apos;ll get used to the new situation without great suffering . &quot;
At dawn , the priest took his godchild with him .
When they climbed the pass , they descended into the next valley .
At nightfall , the church tower of Vissoy came into view .
As soon as the hay crashed , the village chief celebrated his wedding .
&quot; Something is changing with you , Jean .
Your father will marry again . &quot;
&quot; My little one , you must also think of those you love . &quot;
&quot; Do you want your sister Pierrette to be badly brought up and your dad to live sad and alone forever ? &quot;
&quot; Do I have to say &apos; Mama &apos; to her ? &quot;
&quot; Well ... you could call her &apos; Mother &apos; .
At the end of the month ...
With a heavy heart , but full of good intentions , Jean returned to his childhood home .
Everything seemed to him as if he &apos;d been gone for years .
Even before he entered the house , he seemed changed .
&quot; What do I want ?
Enter my home , to thunder ! &quot;
&quot; Mama told me not to let anyone in . &quot;
&quot; But I &apos;m Jean , I live here ! &quot;
&quot; Who gave you permission to use my crayons ? &quot;
&quot; Mom . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s where Pierrette and I sleep .
You &apos;re sleeping in that little room at the end of the hallway . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve got to listen to me , because I &apos;m your mama now .
Then I &apos;ll love you , and you &apos;re my little boy . &quot;
&quot; And you &apos;ve got to be happy .
I don &apos;t like sad , dreamy kids , they &apos;re lazy . &quot;
&quot; Yes , Madame . &quot;
At the afternoon bread .
&quot; ... do not fight , but love and support each other . &quot;
The following Sunday .
Jean has just recognized his mother &apos;s brooch .
&quot; What have you got ? &quot;
The hostility between the children soon showed .
Pierrette and Jean always played on &quot; their island , &quot; far from Arlette , who couldn &apos;t get to them .
&quot; Where &apos;s your hat ? &quot;
One day , the attic was cleaned .
&quot; The stuff is still good , enough for a dress for each of you . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s not yours , it &apos;s my mum &apos;s ! &quot;
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot;
&quot; Answer ! &quot;
&quot; Answer me ! &quot;
&quot; I hate them !
I hate her !
I hate her ! &quot;
After a few months , Jean and Arlette hated each other .
&quot; My doll !
I lost my doll ! &quot;
&quot; Now it &apos;s too late to find her . &quot;
In the evening .
&quot; Ridiculous to cry for a lost doll at your age ! &quot;
&quot; Go up , I &apos;ll be with you in a moment . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure the doll fell off near the bridge . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s not far .
Go ahead , I &apos;ll open the door for you . &quot;
Jean just wanted Arlette to get in trouble .
Now he began to sense the magnitude of his actions .
Lost .
&quot; Do you hear the avalanche ? &quot;
The only solution :
Confess everything immediately .
&quot; Are you sick ? &quot;
&quot; I want to talk to Dad . &quot;
&quot; Go home and pray . &quot;
Tormented by fear and guilt , he turned to the image of his mother , but it seemed far away and extinct .
Even the portrait failed him .
The next morning .
His father didn &apos;t blame him .
Jean thought he was scum in his family &apos;s eyes from now on .
He assumed he was a criminal .
&quot; Dear Papa , goodbye .
I &apos;m a villain .
I hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
I &apos;ll give you a hug , Jean . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll go away forever . &quot;
&quot; Since you forgive me , would you give me a hug ? &quot;
&quot; Mom . &quot;
THE END
THE IMAGINARY RISE OF Rene Clair ( 1925 )
One summer morning in a small town in the country .
A poor and shy man on his way to work in a bank .
Auguste , a worker .
Albert , another employee .
Lucie , a typist .
The bank manager .
Rosa Koslex , &quot; authorized &quot; hand reader .
&quot; I see three men who love you ! &quot;
&quot; You will marry the man you love ! &quot;
&quot; You will marry the woman you love ! &quot;
&quot; A beautiful future ! &quot;
This afternoon ...
&quot; Jean , don &apos;t get upset with me ! &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t love Albert . &quot;
My dear Jean , it &apos;s you I love .
Here &apos;s your engagement ring .
Your Lucie .
&quot; Thanks to your kiss , I have regained my strength .
Look ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a fairy !
A hundred years ago , a magician stole my powers .
Only the kiss of a young man could restore it ... &quot;
&quot; Follow me , you shall be rewarded ! &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re in the hospice for old fairies . &quot;
&quot; Nowadays , no one believes in fairies anymore .
So , my old sisters locked themselves in this cave . &quot;
&quot; They want you to kiss them ... all of them ! &quot;
&quot; Step back ! &quot;
This is Sylvaine , an evil fairy .
Watch out , it &apos;s really bad !
&quot; These are your old friends , Puss in Boots ... &quot;
&quot; Bluebeard ... &quot;
&quot; ...
Cinderella and the Prince ... &quot;
&quot; Be glad the fairies give you immortality .
You will live with us forever ! &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to live forever if Lucie is not with me ! &quot;
&quot; Since you can &apos;t be without them , we should bring them here ! &quot;
&quot; Look , it &apos;s your fiancée ! &quot;
&quot; I wanted your friends to be here too ! &quot;
A fascinating life begins .
Thanks to these two lovers , an atmosphere of tenderness has penetrated the ancient cave of fairies .
&quot; The evil New Year &apos;s Eve is jealous of Lucie .
I fear their power .
Lucie has to go . &quot;
&quot; Take this as a souvenir .
With this ring all you have to do is ... make a wish and it will come true ! &quot;
&quot; If I accept to give you the girl , you must solemnly promise something that will ensure her happiness ! &quot;
&quot; I repeat : with all my heart I want to be like a faithful dog to Lucie . &quot;
A dog !
&quot; We did it !
His oath transformed him .
Suddenly he became a dog ! &quot;
But where is Jean ?
&quot; Jean said we &apos;d meet here . &quot;
For the thief , the ring has lost its magic power .
&quot; Don &apos;t wait for Jean .
That damn ring turned him into a dog !
It &apos;s in your hand ! &quot;
&quot; Jean , is that you ? &quot;
At midnight ...
Through the power of imagination , with a normal ring , Jean has regained his confidence .
THE END
A German folklore
Behold :
&quot; Open the gates of darkness , and the terrors of the peoples chase over the earth ... &quot;
&quot; Back !
Stop !
What do you mean by war , plague , famine ?
! &quot;
&quot; Mine is the earth ! &quot;
&quot; The earth will never be yours !
Man is good : his spirit strives for the truth ! &quot;
&quot; Look down there ! &quot;
&quot; Wonderful are all things heaven and earth !
But the greatest miracle ... is the freedom of man ... to choose between good and evil . &quot;
&quot; Did you see Faust ? &quot;
&quot; A scoundrel like everyone else !
He teaches good things and he drives evil !
He will create gold and the Stone of the Sages !
Look at his greed ! &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s the bet ?
I &apos;ll take Fausten &apos;s soul from God ! &quot;
&quot; Can you destroy the divine in Faust : yours be the earth ! &quot;
&quot; No man can resist evil !
The race ! &quot;
&quot; The plague !
The plague ! &quot;
Terribly , the plague spread :
Half the city was dying in a few days !
Day and night Faust wrestled in prayer with God to find a cure for the plague .
And there was screaming all over Aegyptand because there was no house where there wasn &apos;t a dead one .
&quot; Bless the work of salvation , my God , only you can help in this iammer ! &quot;
&quot; Help ... help !
My mother &apos;s dying ! &quot;
The city was filled with agony and death ...
&quot; Do penance fast and pray !
Faith only conquers death ! &quot;
&quot; Be honored before death ! &quot;
&quot; We don &apos;t know when it &apos;ll hit us !
Until then , we want to live and enjoy ! &quot;
&quot; He who believes will live !
But death will crush the wicked ! &quot;
&quot; The plague !
The plague ! &quot;
&quot; Mercy , Faust !
Only you can save us ! &quot;
&quot; Let go of me !
We &apos;re lost !
It doesn &apos;t help to believe , it doesn &apos;t help to know !
Everything is a lie ... &quot;
You , Serr God , are merciful to us of great kindness .
The Triple Giant Key to the Infernal Spirits &apos; compulsion
And do you want the Dark Lord to help you , and give you all the power and glory in the world , go to a crossroads and call him dreymal ...
&quot; I call upon you for help , Spirit of Darkness ! &quot;
&quot; Show up , demon of evil ! &quot;
&quot; What you call yourself with your hellish name :
MEPHISTO ! &quot;
&quot; You called me ! &quot;
&quot; Here I am ! &quot;
I &apos;m relieving God and his heavenly army
&quot; Get away from me , Satan ! &quot;
&quot; One day out of this faint ! &quot;
&quot; One day !
Try it !
A trial day ! &quot;
&quot; When the glass is filled ... &quot;
&quot; ... you are free to reclaim the pact ! &quot;
Make glory
&quot; Can you help the hungry and the sick ? &quot;
&quot; Whatever you desire , I will fulfill it for you : you are the Lord , I am your servant ! &quot;
&quot; A drop of blood ! &quot;
&quot; Blood is a very special juice ! &quot;
&quot; For one day ... ? &quot;
&quot; Till the glass is filled ! &quot;
&quot; Fist !
Help us ! &quot;
&quot; So I help in the name of the devil ! &quot;
&quot; A miracle !
A miracle ! &quot;
&quot; I will always pray to the Crucified One for you , if you heal her ! &quot;
&quot; He can &apos;t look at the Holy Cross ! &quot;
&quot; The devil is in league with him !
Stone him !
Stone him ! &quot;
&quot; Deliver me , potion of death ! &quot;
&quot; You must not escape me !
Remember the pact , but the test day is not over . &quot;
&quot; Death is free to all men ! &quot;
&quot; Is that death ? &quot;
&quot; It is life , Faust , that punches you in the face with your youth ! &quot;
&quot; Poor fist , why do you seek death : you have not yet lived ! &quot;
&quot; I hate life ! &quot;
&quot; Your life was just book dust and muck !
Pleasure is everything ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m too old ! &quot;
&quot; I offer you the greatest happiness : the youth !
Grab it ! &quot;
&quot; Give me youth ! &quot;
&quot; We sang the old man ! &quot;
&quot; To her ... to her ! &quot;
&quot; Step on my coat ... &quot;
&quot; ... and around you the earth is circling ! &quot;
&quot; The wedding of the Duchess of Parma , the most beautiful woman in Italy . &quot;
&quot; Strange guests ! &quot;
&quot; Honoring the highest beauty , my Lord brings you the treasures of his realms ! &quot;
&quot; The rehearsal day is over !
The glass is full !
Be who you were !
&quot; Youth ...
Leave me the youth ! &quot;
&quot; Forever fall for me ! &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve cost your life thoroughly , Faust !
From high to high , a dove without equal , but nothing satisfies you ! &quot;
&quot; Do you want a woman a card game , a Bacchanal ?
Whatever you wish for , I must fulfill it for you ! &quot;
&quot; Do you want the Emperor &apos;s crown ? &quot;
&quot; Home ! &quot;
&quot; Bring me home !
And right now ! &quot;
&quot; Is there a feast in your city today ? &quot;
&quot; You have come from the Turkish land , that you hear nothing of holy Easter ? &quot;
&quot; As if life always stands still :
It &apos;s all still the same ... &quot;
&quot; An innocent snake running to the priest ... around the parsonage ...
It &apos;s not for you ! &quot;
&quot; Praise the Lord , the mighty king of honor ... &quot;
&quot; Vacation , Mother ! &quot;
&quot; I know you here , more pleasing whores ! &quot;
&quot; I just want her !
You do as I say ! &quot;
&quot; Brother Valentin ! &quot;
&quot; Once she has this golden chain in the house , she will feel the devil &apos;s power ! &quot;
&quot; Blimey , how pretty you are ! &quot;
&quot; What about the suitor ? &quot;
&quot; What have you got , child ? &quot;
&quot; Tell her , my child , if you don &apos;t want to tell me ! &quot;
&quot; May I go to the Muhme Marthe ? &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Marthe Schwerdtlein . &quot;
&quot; Three drops of this love potion make all the women &apos;s hearts great after you ! &quot;
&quot; Look , Muhme Marthe , what I found one of my Ark ! &quot;
&quot; A rich treasure , confess it ! &quot;
&quot; I found it in my drawer ! &quot;
&quot; Just let me put on the beautiful necklace for once ! &quot;
&quot; A bouquet for the groom , a wreath for the bride ... &quot;
&quot; Excuse me , beautiful woman , I &apos;m looking for Mrs. Marthe Schwerdtlein ! &quot;
&quot; From your cousin from Lombardy ... &quot;
&quot; He gave me this necklace as a gift for you ! &quot;
&quot; Whoever we close in a row , he shall be our sweetheart ... ! &quot;
&quot; One , two , three , free yourself ... &quot;
&quot; Forgive me , my stomach is too weak for such a fiery drink ! &quot;
&quot; Allow me to mix myself with a tear , as I learned in Padua ! &quot;
&quot; My friend , a prince of the noblest blood ! &quot;
Love me ...
&quot; Yes , he loves you with all his heart ! &quot;
&quot; She loves me ...
&quot; She loves you ! &quot;
&quot; I am yours forever ! &quot;
&quot; He loves me ... &quot;
&quot; What are you waiting for ?
The darling shines even on your way ... !
&quot; Cursed cudder ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m keeping my brother away ! &quot;
&quot; The prettiest girl in town ! &quot;
&quot; There is no girl like your sister :
Gretchen shall live ! &quot;
&quot; A pretty girl is not good ! &quot;
&quot; Gretchen shall live ! &quot;
&quot; Your Gretchen shall live ! &quot;
&quot; Hurry up , before Gretchen sneaks out of her chamber ! &quot;
&quot; Away ... away ...
You murdered him ! &quot;
&quot; Murder ! &quot;
&quot; Murder ! &quot;
Murder !
Murder ...
Murder ! &quot;
Gone !
...
Away !
The bunnies are already looking for the killer ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t touch me , you whore !
&quot; Read me the funeral mass first !
Then , to the plague with the harlot ! &quot;
&quot; Gretchen ...
Gretchen ... ! &quot;
&quot; The earth and the universe will tremble when the dead rise to answer their Lord ... &quot;
&quot; Once the judge has taken his seat , concealment will no longer be pious ... &quot;
&quot; Everything must come to light ! &quot;
&quot; Mother ...
Mother ! &quot;
&quot; And has brought a child , in the middle of cold winter ... &quot;
&quot; Have mercy on my child ! &quot;
&quot; Aren &apos;t you Gretchen , who was on the line ? &quot;
&quot; Mercy !
Mercy !
My child is dying ! &quot;
&quot; She killed her child , the murderer ! &quot;
&quot; Faust ...
Fist ... help your Gretchen ! &quot;
&quot; Mephisto ! &quot;
&quot; You betrayed me !
She &apos;s suffering ... she &apos;s suffering ! &quot;
&quot; The child murderer to the stake ! &quot;
&quot; Save , save Gretchen ! &quot;
&quot; Too late !
They &apos;re already arming your pyre ! &quot;
&quot; You are also my servant !
Bring me to her or the pact will be torn up . &quot;
&quot; My mouth is waiting !
Quickly , before the mornings rise ! &quot;
&quot; Faster ...
Faster ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , I would never have wished for the youth that created such lamb !
Cursed ... cursed ... the madness of youth !
&quot; You cursed the youth yourself !
What you wish for I must fulfill it for you ! &quot;
&quot; Be who you were : an old man ! &quot;
&quot; Forgive ... forgive me for my guilt ! &quot;
&quot; There is no way for you here ! &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s my pact ! &quot;
&quot; One word destroy your pact ! &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s the word ? &quot;
The word that echoes cheering through creation , the word that satisfies all pain and sorrow , the word that repents all human guilt , the everlasting word , you do not know it ? &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s the word ? &quot;
Love

The Yukon
Gold fever had drawn them to this lonely shore .
The Irishman Michael Dennin ( Vladimir Fogel &apos; )
Chairman Hans Nelson , a Swede ( Sergei Komarov )
Nelson &apos;s wife , the English Edith ( Aleksandra Chochlova )
The shareholder Dutchy ( Porfirij Podobed )
The shareholder Harkey ( Petr Galadev )
We can &apos;t get anything from this mine , we have to look elsewhere .
Go Dennin , pack up the instruments , and we &apos;ll move on .
It &apos;s the company &apos;s mine .
Gold .
Gold .
Fortune remained with the company throughout the winter .
Small house - great luck !
It went on with the gold laundry and the gold mining .
It was me who found the gold , and they &apos;re making me a laundress here .
Spring was coming .
Lunch .
Dennin is missing , he &apos;s not hungry anymore .
Cheers , Mr. Dennin .
Stop it !
Stop it !
Stop it ...
He &apos;s alive .
Not without law - that &apos;s a white man !
The weather was changing .
One inch an hour .
I &apos;ll kill you anyway !
He &apos;s dead ...
The two graves are ready if the Yukon does not flood them ...
In darkness and storms , the two murder victims set off for their icy tombs .
After rain and storm , the icy surface of the Yukon was covered with water .
Day after day , in paralyzing silence .
Man or woman , one of them always sat next to the criminal .
Kill me !
Give me a drink !
The ice broke on the Yukon .
Hi .
Night .
Another day .
What are you going to do with me ?
We will deal with you according to the law .
I &apos;m so tired , so tired ...
The tobacco is not enough .
Give me back my tobacco !
Not without law !
Now came Edith &apos;s birthday .
Don &apos;t worry .
Get over here !
For you - a birthday present ...
Shave me ...
Shave it !
It &apos;s my birthday !
Why did you do it ?
It seemed so terribly simple .
And you always said I &apos;d end up on the gallows !
Days passed , but it was not expected that the law would come sooner than in a few weeks .
Let &apos;s make a verdict .
Not today , it &apos;s Sunday !
The Queen of England
Edith insisted that the trial be conducted under English law , as the criminal was a subject of the queen .
Defendant , you are Irish , and so we will judge you on behalf of Queen Victoria .
The judges
The witnesses
The jury
The verdict
Michael Dennin , according to the royal law , you will be hanged ... and you will hang until you are dead .
Dead ... dead ...
I spoke well .
As with us in court ...
Well , now it &apos;s all over .
They say this death does not cause pain ...
The set time had come .
Lord have mercy , Lord have mercy , have mercy on us !
If I had to do this for you , Hans , I couldn &apos;t have done better !
The execution
May God receive you penitent sinners !
Here - may it bring you luck !

From the Matochkin Sea Narrow to Buchara
From Noworossiysk to Leningrad
From the lighthouse at the Arctic Circle to the mountains of the Caucasus
From the stone eagle on the arm of the Kirgisen to the oaths on the rocks of the ice sea to the owls of the North
Everything is in your
Hands up
You own the buffalo
the goats at the Ulu-Usen River
The camels of the kirgisian steppe
the reindeer
The Siberian squirrel
the polar fox in the trap iron
The Marder
the brown bear
the sable found in the far north
the Karakulsheep
Everything is yours
Your factories
Your work
Your oil
Your cotton
And the sheep
the wool
the wool
the wool
Your fat
The fish
Your flap
Your tobacco
and your vast wealth ... belongs to you ...
On all roads of the Soviet Union , goods for export
via dirt roads
Over mountain paths
And with camel caravans
and where the two-wheeled carts are anticipated buffalo
where nomads drive their flocks
where the herds cross the river
where fruit is packed in boxes
and where the Wogule ties the knot with his teeth
where flax is brought to the port for export
GOSTORG ( State Trade Organization )
Where the cisterns and tanks are full of sunflower oil
where the caviar is shipped
the cattle
The cement
where the grain ... flows in an endless stream into foreign cargo ships
and where no path leads
where you cannot meet a single human being over a distance of thousands of miles .
In the thick frost
in the snowdrifts of the endless tundra they fight their way through to the nearest collection point of the state trade organization so that they can deliver their spoils ... for shipping to capitalist countries
Far away at the Arctic Circle where the sun never sets
Every year they come to Novaya Zemlya with dogs with flour .
The SamoEverybody &apos;s staying with the sailors
From the gramophone they hear Lenin himself
After 24 hours the steamer leaves again and takes furry animal skins with it .
and these skins will be traded for machines for the Soviet Union , and in capitalist country , the skins , captured by Tungusen , East Yanks , SamoEach , will be traded for machines for machines that produce machines again .
So the country builds proletarian dictatorship , and even the peoples who still live in the patriarchy through the expansion of state commerce .
along with middle-and-small farmers bringing their grain into the cooperative with the farmers who get a tractor through the cooperative for the collective farming of the soil .
Along with the workers at the socialist plant
Along with the workers in the socialist factory
The Black Sea
The Black Sea
and yours by the sea frozen on the Baltic shore
Frozen ship in the ice
and one that disappears into an icy , unknown distance
Here and there they dig the earth with a stick
Here and there are women with veiled faces
Some still pray the rosary
Some people act crazy .
Somewhere the shaman still works
There are still places where you perform a rejuvenation rite for women .
There are still places where the god Menkwa is sacrificed .
Slowly the old disappears ... just as you disappear into an icy distance
Nor do they believe in the help of Mohammeds
nor do they believe in Christ &apos;s help
to the help of Buddha
or like the Tungusen ...
I see you
Black Sea and your sea on the Baltic shore frozen
Frozen ship in the ice
And you &apos;re an icebreaker Lenin
You break the ice with your chest
We are clearing the way ... for our cargo ships to exchange our grain and our furs .
for machines that produce machines so that they can grow even sooner our own production of machines
I see a woman who has cast the veil
another woman who works among the women of the East
a Samojeon Komsomolzine reading the Northerners &apos; newspaper .
Buryates and Mongols reading the Buryato-Mongols Pravda
Mongol children joining a pioneer division
A polar laboratory will be set up to support the reindeer breeder
Irrigation ducts are built by low-water steppes .
The electric light bulb comes into the farmhouse
A reading house
Ostrovsky
- Reading House
- Library .
and a radio show
VoIovstroy
Works more works
I see that we want to produce , not only Kattun but also the machines we need for the production of Kattun
We want to produce not only tractors , but the machines to produce the tractors .
We are building a complete socialist society in our country .
We are a attraction to the workers of the West
a point of attraction for the people of the East who are already rising up to fight against the yoke of capital
oppressed countries slowly falling off the world capital
They will pour into the current of the united socialist economy
into the current of the united socialist economy
The End
Spring 1861 , the Western Atlantic Flyer in full drive to Marietta , Georgia .
There were two great loves in his life .
His locomotive ... and ...
&quot; Fort Sumter has been shot at . &quot;
&quot; Then the war caught up with us . &quot;
&quot; Yes , Father , and I would like to volunteer as one of the first . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you want to get in touch ? &quot;
&quot; Your name ? &quot;
&quot; Profession ? &quot;
&quot; Engineer at Western and Atlantic Railroad Company . &quot;
&quot; Refuse .
As a engineer , he &apos;s more useful to the South . &quot;
&quot; We can &apos;t use you . &quot;
&quot; Profession ? &quot;
&quot; Bartender &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t blame me if you lose the war . &quot;
&quot; Did Johnnie come forward ? &quot;
&quot; He didn &apos;t even line up . &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s a disgrace to the South . &quot;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you call ? &quot;
&quot; They wouldn &apos;t take me . &quot;
&quot; Please don &apos;t lie to me ...
I won &apos;t talk to you again until you wear a uniform . &quot;
A year later .
In a Union field camp north of Chattanooga .
General Thatcher and his chief spy , Captain Anderson .
&quot; I know every inch of the railway line from Marietta to Chattanooga .
&quot; We pretend to be civilians from neutral Kentucky who want to join the cause of the South . &quot;
&quot; In Big Shanty , we steal the train while everyone is eating , and we &apos;ll burn down all the bridges to the north , and cut off the enemy army from supplies . &quot;
&quot; On the same day that you steal the train , I will have General Parker advance to meet you . &quot;
&quot; As soon as I arrive , I will tell you how badly Father is wounded . &quot;
&quot; Big Shanty .
Twenty minutes for dinner . &quot;
&quot; Three men stole my &quot; general . &quot;
Probably deserters . &quot;
&quot; Why not stop and fight them ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid they &apos;re far outnumbered . &quot;
The South Army outside Chattanooga has been ordered to withdraw .
General Parker &apos;s victorious Northern Army is advancing .
&quot; There &apos;s only one man on this locomotive . &quot;
In enemy territory ... hopelessly lost , helpless , freezing and terribly hungry .
&quot; Tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. , our supply trains will join us at Rock River Bridge General Parker &apos;s army . &quot;
&quot; Then the army , supported by our supply , will launch a surprise attack on the left wing of the rebels . &quot;
&quot; Once our troops have crossed this bridge , nothing can stop us . &quot;
&quot; This girl was in the baggage carriage when the train was robbed and I thought it was best to take her with me . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ll stay here until morning to see where we are . &quot;
&quot; It was so brave of you to risk your life in enemy territory just to save me . &quot;
After a good , quiet and restful night &apos;s sleep .
&quot; We have to somehow get back to our people to warn you of the impending attack . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll get this spy before he reaches the southern lines .
They &apos;ll follow with the supply trains as planned . &quot;
&quot; We must gather more firewood . &quot;
The Rock River Bridge .
The Northern Division is approaching to join the trains .
&quot; The bridge doesn &apos;t burn enough to stop you .
Heroes of the day .
&quot; Is that your uniform ? &quot;
&quot; I had to wear them to get through enemy lines . &quot;
&quot; Take off your clothes . &quot;
&quot; Write down the lieutenant . &quot;
&quot; Profession ? &quot;
&quot; Soldier . &quot;
This song of a man and his wife ... plays everywhere and nowhere .
It can be heard in any place , any time .
For wherever the sun rises and sets , in the bustle of the city or under the open sky in the country , life is the same :
Sometimes bitter , sometimes sweet .
Summer time ... holiday time
Among the holidays was a woman from the city .
Several weeks have passed since her arrival , and she still remains .
&quot; They were like children , carefree ... &quot;
Always happy and laughing ... &quot;
&quot; Now he &apos;s ruining himself because of this woman in town .
&quot; Money lenders raid the farm and his wife is alone . &quot;
&quot; Tell me , are you all mine ? &quot;
&quot; Sell your farm .
Come into town with me . &quot;
&quot; And my wife ? &quot;
&quot; Could she not be drowned ? &quot;
&quot; Capsize the boat and it &apos;ll look like an accident . &quot;
&quot; Put it all behind you .
Come to town with me . &quot;
&quot; Come to the city with me ! &quot;
&quot; When the boat capsized , save yourself with the reed . &quot;
Spread it out on the shore in time and tell everyone she &apos;s drowned . &quot;
&quot; We take a ride across the water .
I &apos;ll be gone for a while . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be afraid of me ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be afraid of me ! &quot;
&quot; God entrusts her to you in holy matrimony , and she is young and inexperienced .
Guide and love her . &quot;
&quot; Protect and protect them from all evil . &quot;
&quot; Will you love her ? &quot;
&quot; &apos; Forgive me ! &quot; &apos;
&quot; Manicure ? &quot;
&quot; You look fabulous with polished nails ! &quot;
&quot; Join us again ! &quot;
Thank you .
You &apos;ve got to come and see us . &quot;
The loveliest bride this year . &quot;
If you want to sell the farm and move to the city ...
&quot; Hit the hole and the piglet slips ! &quot;
&quot; We sail home in the moonlight . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t give up hope .
I know the tides and I looked around . &quot;

THE WORKERS - AND BUILDING REVOLUTION
Translation : unknown Transcript : arcchancellor
The docks of New York
The waterfront of New York is the last stop of many journeys and the beginning of many adventures .
Miles of docks wait day and night for wicked sailors and their cargo .
Ships arrive and rest for 1 2 days from their endless journey from port to port .
These are the days before there was heavy oil and the heaters were paid for with sweat and coal dust .
&quot; Very well , Bill !
We just made it on time with the barge ! &quot;
&quot; Pick up the trash !
Nobody goes ashore until this hole is clean ! &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re leaving tomorrow morning . &quot;
&quot; You have one night on land .
If you come back drunk , you work a double shift tomorrow ! &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s the biggest choleric I know , really bad ! &quot;
&quot; He probably thinks we &apos;re just going ashore to play marble ! &quot;
The sandbar , just a good distance from the wharf , which also rubs off on the upswing .
That night , it was fresh and stormy .
Protect his soul and give the money to Harry .
&quot; This is my husband ! &quot;
&quot; Well , Andy !
I bet you weren &apos;t expecting me here ! &quot;
In the night and fog the stoker goes ashore .
&quot; Hey , Bill !
This is not a place to get a woman ! &quot;
&quot; Come on , Bill .
They &apos;ll take care of her . &quot;
&quot; Okay , Bill !
Be a hero and leave your comrades behind . &quot;
&quot; But remember Singapore and remember what happened in Shanghai ! &quot;
&quot; Well , good you gave me the gig .
That was three years ago , what do you think I should do ? &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s go before the police come ! &quot;
&quot; Order her a hot drink ! &quot;
&quot; A hot toddy ! &quot;
&quot; You can &apos;t come in here !
She &apos;s only got underwear on ! &quot;
&quot; So you &apos;re the guy who saved my life ? &quot;
You could have saved yourself the trouble of watching me die . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s all right !
Just think that you died and just start over . &quot;
&quot; You left all the dirt in the river , baby .
All you need is a good time . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve had a lot of nice moments . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve never gone out with Bill Roberts . &quot;
&quot; Dry yourself off before you catch a cold ! &quot;
&quot; Would you care ? &quot;
&quot; Well , I mean ... &quot;
&quot; After a month in the coal bunker , I have no sympathy for anyone who wants to leave this beautiful world ! &quot;
&quot; Throw yourself into new clothes and give me a chance . &quot;
&quot; Well , Bill Roberts , I &apos;m giving you a chance . &quot;
&quot; Anyway , I can make a hole in the water ... &quot;
&quot; Will they leave me alone so that I can at least be on my own , or do I have to take a place far away ? &quot;
&quot; I thought you wanted your tie , Bill . &quot;
&quot; Isn &apos;t she beautiful ? &quot;
&quot; You better listen to my advice and stay away from her ! &quot;
&quot; Go away , boy !
I just want to talk to your girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; You may be someone on the ship , but here you are just animal food . &quot;
&quot; Damn , you &apos;re strong ! &quot;
&quot; I bet you knew a lot of women . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t brag about my affairs . &quot;
Me neither .
&quot; Have you ever been married , Bill ? &quot;
&quot; Who would marry someone like me ? &quot;
&quot; Um ... I don &apos;t know , but some women would . &quot;
&quot; Baby , have you ever been married ? &quot;
&quot; Who would marry someone like me ? &quot;
&quot; I drove on the seven seas , but I never saw a ship that was as well cared for as you . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s not funny when you play me like that . &quot;
&quot; Answer me !
Why do you think I &apos;m fucking with you ? &quot;
&quot; What have you ever done that makes you worthless than me ?
I would marry you in a minute ! &quot;
&quot; I will marry you from the spot ! &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t know Bill Roberts !
I &apos;d take anyone else ! &quot;
&quot; Bring me a priest , he will reunite me with my girlfriend ! &quot;
&quot; Come back here , Bill , don &apos;t make a fool of yourself ! &quot;
&quot; This is the bride ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d better tell Harry &apos;s hymn book before he wrecks the place ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll do it in front of our Nell !
I &apos;m going to marry her , here and now ! &quot;
&quot; Do you think he can bring you to your senses by getting married ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t even know what to think anymore . &quot;
&quot; Until I got married , I was decent ! &quot;
&quot; I will give you a marriage you will never forget ! &quot;
&quot; Where &apos;s your deed ? &quot;
&quot; Do you want to spoil the fun just because you need a piece of paper ? &quot;
&quot; Bill &apos;s gonna get it first thing tomorrow when he really needs it . &quot;
&quot; Isn &apos;t it , Bill ? &quot;
&quot; Word of honor , Parson .
That &apos;s the first thing tomorrow morning . &quot;
&quot; Let the old man do it !
I will marry you . &quot;
&quot; If any of you have an objection to why they can &apos;t get married , talk now or keep quiet forever . &quot;
&quot; Does it really mean that much to you ? &quot;
&quot; Dear friends , we are gathered here before God and in the presence of the community &quot;
&quot; - to lead this man and this woman into the holy state of marriage . &quot;
&quot; Marriage is an honorable good ... but it is not easy . &quot;
&quot; Will you take this woman to be your wife ? &quot;
&quot; Will you love them , protect them , honor them , in sickness and in health , you will renounce them all as long as you both live ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I do ! &quot;
&quot; I do . &quot;
&quot; Give me the ring . &quot;
&quot; Here &apos;s mine
- I hope he brings you more luck than me ! &quot;
&quot; Here &apos;s your money , Parson .
Easy come , easy go ! &quot;
&quot; I expect them to bring me the certificate tomorrow morning .
Then I &apos;ll give them the money . &quot;
&quot; What is this celebration ? &quot;
&quot; I thought you were married and wanted to settle down . &quot;
&quot; But how did you get rid of her ? &quot;
&quot; Who said anything about getting rid of it ? &quot;
&quot; I know you , Bill Roberts !
You can cheat on her , but not me ! &quot;
&quot; What woman threw the shoe ? &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t know what it means to me , Bill ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll be a good woman , Bill . &quot;
The next morning .
&quot; Do you have a match , boss ? &quot;
&quot; I suppose you don &apos;t remember last night ? &quot;
&quot; Were you never young , boss ?
I was just having a bit of fun ! &quot;
&quot; I suppose you &apos;ve forgotten you &apos;re married , too . &quot;
&quot; Boss , last night is over .
Today is a new day ! &quot;
&quot; Maybe for you , but not for me .
This brawl will cost you your job ! &quot;
&quot; One ship is as good as the next , boss .
Like any port in a storm ! &quot;
&quot; Get out or my husband will kill you ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t fool me ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t let Bill Roberts stand between us , you know he &apos;ll never come back ! &quot;
&quot; You dirty liar !
He &apos;s coming back ! &quot;
&quot; Get a stretcher fast , the guy &apos;s in a bad shape ! &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re not going anywhere , shut up ! &quot;
&quot; I warned you !
Now shoot me while you still have time . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m her husband . &quot;
&quot; She didn &apos;t shoot him .
The child couldn &apos;t even hurt a fly ! &quot;
&quot; Nobody but me shot him , and I &apos;m entitled to that recognition . &quot;
&quot; I am his wife , at least he often made me feel like it ! &quot;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you say that before ? &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t care before . &quot;
&quot; I hope you &apos;re luckier than I am , but I don &apos;t think so . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t expect you to come back to help me . &quot;
&quot; Baby , you don &apos;t need my help . &quot;
&quot; Are you leaving , Bill ? &quot;
&quot; Baby I &apos;m sorry .
Leaving is in an hour and I have never missed a ship in my life . &quot;
&quot; Can you give me another minute to get used to it , Bill ? &quot;
&quot; I never thanked you for pulling me out of the water . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s okay ! &quot;
&quot; I never thanked you for the beautiful clothes you bought me . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t mention it . &quot;
&quot; I guess I &apos;m supposed to thank you for allowing me to be your decent wife . &quot;
&quot; Listen , child , you can &apos;t hurt me !
I &apos;ve never done an honorable thing in my life . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve always been like that .
No power in the world could keep me in the country forever ! &quot;
&quot; Why do you take everything so seriously ?
You knew I was only on land for one night and I was just a dirty stoker ! &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re not so bad , Bill Roberts ! &quot;
&quot; It would have been fun , even if it was just a few months . &quot;
&quot; If I ever stayed ashore for months , I might even like it . &quot;
&quot; Get moving , Bill .
The time has passed ! &quot;
&quot; See you later , baby . &quot;
&quot; Well ... take care ...
Bill . &quot;
&quot; Come here before you get into new trouble ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll sort this out for you , Bill .
You can &apos;t go to sea like that . &quot;
&quot; What are you going to do , bring me more bad luck ? &quot;
&quot; Are you superstitious ? &quot;
&quot; The woman has a nerve to cry after all I &apos;ve done for her ! &quot;
&quot; Like I said , she wasn &apos;t good for you , like all women ! &quot;
&quot; You were lucky I happened to come by !
If I hadn &apos;t been curious , you would have become a barnacle ! &quot;
&quot; Hurry up , you two !
I need steam and no talking ! &quot;
&quot; I have to arrest her for it ! &quot;
&quot; Where is my wife ? &quot;
&quot; In prison , where it belongs . &quot;
&quot; Why is she in jail ? &quot;
&quot; Why don &apos;t you go to the night court and find out for yourself ? &quot;
&quot; Thirty days .
Next case ! &quot;
&quot; She was picked up in stolen clothes from the dock pawnshop . &quot;
&quot; How did they get it ? &quot;
&quot; My husband gave it to me . &quot;
&quot; Where &apos;s her husband ? &quot;
&quot; He left me this morning ... &quot;
&quot; How long were they married ? &quot;
&quot; For one night . &quot;
&quot; Thirty days .
Next case ! &quot;
&quot; One moment , Commander !
I &apos;m her husband .
I stole the clothes ! &quot;
&quot; Break in somewhere , take what you need , so that &apos;s their idea ? &quot;
&quot; No , sir , I rang the bell !
But there was no answer , so I helped myself . &quot;
&quot; I see a man of importance and I don &apos;t have time to waste .
What &apos;s your rush ? &quot;
&quot; Well sir , I &apos;m a stoker .
I &apos;ve only got one night on land and I want to have fun in it . &quot;
&quot; Sixty days will cool you down .
Release the woman .
Next case ! &quot;
&quot; Sixty days is not a long drive , it will be my last if you wait for me .
&quot; Bill , I &apos;d wait for you forever . &quot;
Hollywood 1928
The magic kingdom of the twentieth century !
The mecca of the world !
So the Russian director Leo Andreyev traveled to Hollywod .
Every Russian in Hollywood is in this pile !
Sergius Alexander claims a general post in the Russian army and is also a cousin of the Czar .
Has little film experience -- works for $ 7.50 a day .
Tell him he can start working tomorrow morning .
And give him a general uniform .
Eureka Studio is on the phone .
Tomorrow morning at 6 : 00 at the studio &apos;s gate !
The Hollywood queue .
Stop pushing !
Who do you think you are ?
A corporal !
A general !
Stop shaking your head !
How am I supposed to focus on makeup ?
I &apos;m sorry .
There &apos;s nothing I can do about it .
I had a big shock the other day .
Where did you get that thing , did you steal it from a pawnshop ?
The Czar gave it to me .
What do you know about it ?
The Czar gave him this beautiful medallion !
I &apos;m your comrade .
I want to show everybody .
Imperial Russia , 1917 .
Pride , majesty , pride .
Seems forever !
In dozens of scattered battles , Russia wrestled with the enemy in a death grip .
Tired of defending a crumbling empire , Grand Duke Sergius Alexander had arrived cousin to the Czar and leading general of the Russian army .
Everything is in order , Your Imperial Highness .
The revolutionaries have intercepted most of our supplies .
Let him strut a bit more .
His days are numbered !
The days of all who go down Russia are numbered .
Only a few more weeks , but they seem eternal to me .
We &apos;ve waited long enough to get impatient now !
You are requested to appear at passport control tomorrow morning .
They are actors playing for our troops , their passports are being made , but our reports show that they are revolutionaries .
Her name is Natália Dabrovová , the most dangerous revolutionary in Russia !
Get them !
He is too dangerous and she is too beautiful to escape my attention !
This is the second time this week you &apos;ve worn my coat and smoked my cigarettes !
If he does it again , remove the coat and shoot its contents .
So you serve your country by acting !
Very patriotic while Russia is fighting for survival !
Why aren &apos;t you wearing a uniform ?
I have weak lungs .
Maybe it &apos;s just your courage that &apos;s too weak !
You don &apos;t need courage to send others into battle and death !
Arrest him !
What is your relationship with this man ?
There are none .
His name is Leo Andrejev , director of the Kiev imperial theater .
Orders from the General Staff , My Imperial Highness !
Will you honor us with your company ?
The new headquarters .
His Majesty the Tsar will visit the headquarters this afternoon to inspect the troops .
Call back a division from the front , His Majesty believes this war is a social game .
We can &apos;t spare a division .
We need every man !
No discussion !
Send a deloused and equipped division back quickly !
While the flames of war are blazing on the 2,000 miles long front , the troops must be parked in front of the Tsar .
Your Imperial Highness , you must urgently send your orders !
The parade will be over soon !
Russia is leaving you , too , dear cousin .
A week after thousands of men had shed their blood for a piece of earth , a breeze came up .
Where &apos;s the woman ?
I ask that you accept this expression of gratitude for your company .
We &apos;d better do this after caviar !
The General Staff , Your Imperial Highness !
His Majesty is planning a visit to the front line tomorrow !
It would be wise to stage an offensive for him tomorrow !
Not too soon !
My troops are not prepared for an offensive !
I will not sacrifice them for the Tsar &apos;s amusement !
That &apos;s what partial fuel is for a revolution !
Can &apos;t you see this man is seriously ill ?
I &apos;ll show you , you dirty revolutionary dog !
Do you not take too great a risk to contradict the Czar &apos;s wishes ?
I would take any risk to avoid unnecessary sacrifice .
Then why are you continuing this nonsense war ?
We have to win !
Defeat means revolution and the collapse of Russia !
Do you love Russia that much ?
I would like to die tonight if I could help Russia with this !
Before you die , you wouldn &apos;t have a coffee with me .
You &apos;re really beautiful !
It &apos;s easy to fall in love with you !
Your hand is shaking !
Could you hand me my cigarettes ?
Yours are really strong .
Why didn &apos;t they shoot ?
I don &apos;t know why I didn &apos;t kill you .
I suppose because I can &apos;t kill someone who loves Russia as much as you do !
From now on , you are my prisoner of war .
and the prisoner of my love .
A group of obscure characters meet to determine Russia &apos;s fate .
Train number 476 , transporting Grand Duke Sergia Alexandra and his staff returning from the front !
Notify all our agents !
Tonight , Russia becomes a republic !
If the news at the next station is correct , His Highness will not soon forget this journey !
His Highness will arrive in five minutes .
We give him the greatest reception of his life !
All out , ruler of Russia !
Last stop !
We &apos;ve been slaves for too long !
Now we are the rulers !
I &apos;ll help you one day !
I &apos;ll help you turn your head !
This is the end , Your Highness !
Let us hang him in Petrograd so that the whole world can see it !
Look at him !
The most powerful man in Russia even more powerful than the Czar himself !
Let him sweat as we once did !
Let him heat our train to Petrogard !
Would His Highness care for one of his cigarettes ?
Get to the locomotive !
This woman is mine .
It &apos;s part of the coat !
Don &apos;t you understand ?
It was the only way to save your life .
I love you !
These pearls will make your escape from Russia possible !
I love you !
I love you !
So the aftermath of a tormented nation brought another extras to Hollywood .
Bring the extras to the stage !
The director has an important job for you , Pop .
You have to look good !
Is that supposed to be a Russian beard ?
Looks like an ad for cough drops !
It was worn on the left in Russia .
As a general , I need to know .
I &apos;ve made 20 Russia movies .
You can &apos;t teach me anything about Russia !
Bring me a whip !
I have waited 10 years for this moment , Your Imperial Highness .
The same coat , the same uniform , the same man , only the times have changed !
This will be a trench scene just before the fight begins .
You &apos;re the commanding general !
The troops are tired of your fine speeches .
One becomes rebellious and you .
Strike him with this whip !
We don &apos;t have to rehearse this scene because you know how to deal with it .
Music please , Russia &apos;s national anthem .
Wind machine !
Lights on !
Camera !
What difference does it make who will win the war ?
We &apos;re tired of fighting .
You gave your last order !
A new day has come !
Down with your Russia !
Citizens of Russia , you have been misguided by traitors !
The goal is to win !
Long live Russia !
Did we win ?
Yes , Your Imperial Highness , they won !
Tough luck !
The guy was a damn good actor .
He was more than an actor , he was a great man .

THE END
THE PASSION OF THE YOUNG WOMAN OF ORLEANS
A film by Carl Th .
Dreyer
The Paris Deputy librarian has one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world .
Joan of Arc , the trial that ended in her death .
The questions of the judges and Johanna &apos;s answers were recorded with great accuracy .
Reading it , you discover the true Johanna ... not in helmet and armor ... but simple and human ... a young woman who died for her country ... and we are witnessing an incredible drama :
a young , pious woman faces a group of narrow-minded theologians and skilled lawyers .
I swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ... nothing but the truth ...
In France , they call me Jeanne ... in my village , I &apos;m called Jeannette .
How old are you ?
Nineteen ... I think .
Do you know the Lord &apos;s Prayer ?
Who taught you ?
My mother .
Are you going to say it ?
You claim to be sent by God ?
To save France ... that &apos;s why I was born .
So God hates the English ?
I don &apos;t know if God hates or loves the English ... but I do know that the English are all driven out of France ... except those who die here !
You said the archangel Michael appeared to you ... in what form ?
Did he have wings ?
Was he wearing a crown ?
What was he dressed like ?
How did you know if it was a man or a woman ?
Was he undressed ?
Do you think God wasn &apos;t able to clothe him ?
Did he have long hair ?
Why would he cut it ?
Why are you dressed like a man ?
If we gave you women &apos;s clothes , would you wear them ?
When my divine mission is accomplished ... I will dress like a woman again .
So it was God who ordered you to dress as a man ?
And what reward do you expect from our Lord ?
The salvation of my soul .
That &apos;s blasphemy .
That &apos;s disgusting !
She &apos;s a saint to me .
Did God make you promises ?
This has nothing to do with this trial .
Shouldn &apos;t we leave that question to the judges ?
Shall we put this question to a vote ?
All right !
What have you been promised by God ?
Maybe you &apos;d be freed from prison ?
When ?
I don &apos;t know the day ... or the hour .
Since we could not so easily draw a confession from her ... we must come up with something ...
Go look for a letter bearing the signature of King Charles .
Write a letter that I will dictate to you .
My compassion for you is great !
Do you know our king &apos;s signature ?
I have a letter from him for you .
I can &apos;t read .
To our dear Johanna ...
I &apos;m preparing to march to Rouen with a large army .
I &apos;m sending you this devoted priest .
Just as Jesus is the Son of God ... do you claim to be the daughter of God ?
Will you recite the Lord &apos;s Prayer ?
God told you you were going to be released from prison ?
