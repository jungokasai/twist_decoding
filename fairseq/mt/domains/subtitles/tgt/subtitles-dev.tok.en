By a great victory !
God has promised you that you will go to Heaven ?
So you are certain of being saved ?
Be careful , it &apos;s a dangerous answer .
Since you are sure of your salvation , then you have no need of the Church ?
Are you in a state of grace ?
Well ! Respond !
Are you in a state of grace ?
If I am , may God keep me there .
If I am not , may God grant it to me !
Father ... permit me to attend Mass .
Joan , if we permit you to attend Mass ... will you stop wearing men &apos;s clothes ?
So , you would rather dress as a man than attend Mass ?
These shameless clothes ... abominable to God ...
You are no daughter of God .
You are Satan &apos;s creature !
Go prepare the torture chamber .
She really looks like a daughter of God .
In the torture chamber .
Look at your judges .
Don`t you feel that these learned doctors are wiser than you ?
But God is even wiser !
Listen , Joan , we know that your visions do not come from God ... but from the devil .
How do you know a good angel from an evil angel ?
You have knelt before Satan , not St. Michael !
Don &apos;t you see that it &apos;s the Devil who has turned your head ... who has tricked you ... and betrayed you ?
I think she &apos;s ready to abjure !
The Church opens its arms to you . If you reject it , the Church will abandon you and you will be alone ... alone !
Yes , alone ... alone with God !
Even if you part my soul from my body I will revoke nothing ... and if I say something , later I will say it was forced from me !
Not for anything in the world do I want her to die a natural death .
She is very weak .
She has a fever ... we must bleed her .
Be careful , she could end her own life ... she &apos;s very crafty .
Bring the Sacraments .
Is there something you wish to tell us ?
I fear to be in great danger of death ... and if I die , I ask you to bury my body in sacred ground .
The Church is merciful ... it always welcomes the misguided lamb .
Joan , we all want what &apos;s best for you .
Look , I have sent for the Sacraments .
I am a good Christian .
Don`t you know it is the Body of the Lord that you refuse ?
Do you not see that you outrage God by your obstinacy ?
I love and honor God ...
with all my heart .
You claim ... that I am ...
sent by the devil .
It &apos;s not true ... to make me suffer , the devil has sent you ... and you ... and you ... and you ...
There is nothing left to be done ... alert the torturer !
Let us try one last time to save this lost soul ...
It is to you , Joan , that I speak .
It is to you that I say that your King is a heretic !
My King is the most noble Christian of all Christians .
The arrogance of this woman is insane .
France has never seen such a monster .
I have never wronged anyone .
If you do not sign , you will be burned alive ...
See the torturer who awaits .
You don &apos;t have the right to die .
Your King still needs you .
Joan , sign ...
and save your life !
Joan , we have great pity for you .
Sign , Joan !
In the name of the Lord .
Amen .
Since you recognized your errors , we exonerate you from the bonds of excommunication .
But because you have greatly sinned , we condemn you ... to perpetual imprisonment with the bread of sorrow and the water of anguish .
You made a good day &apos;s work :
you have saved your life and your soul .
She has only made fools of you !
Long live Joan !
Go find the judges !
I take it back , I have lied ...
Hurry !
I have committed a great sin ...
I have denied God ... to save my life .
But , Joan , before the people you have confessed that you were inspired by the devil .
You still believe you were elect by the Lord ?
That answer is equivalent to death .
I acknowledged from fear of the fire .
Have you anything else to tell us ?
We have come to prepare you for death .
Now ... already ?
Which death ?
At the stake .
I &apos;ll bring the last Sacrament .
Tell me , how can you still believe that you are sent by God ?
His ways are not our ways .
Yes , I am His child .
And the great victory ?
My martyrdom !
And your deliverance ?
Death !
Will you take confession ?
May the Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ keep thy soul ... in everlasting life .
Amen .
Be courageous , Joan .
Your last hour is close .
Dear sweet God , I accept death with a good heart ... but do not let me suffer too long .
Will I be with You tonight in Paradise ?
Jesus !
You have burned a saint !
The flames sheltered Joan &apos;s soul as it rose to heaven .
Joan whose heart has become the heart of France ...
Joan whose memory will always be honoured by the people of France .

DRESS REHEARSAL STARTING WITH 4TH ACT
It &apos;s nice to hear French music once in a while , isn &apos;t it ? Yes , people must be getting fed up with jazz .
-Is that your costume ?
-No , they &apos;re fixing it .
They &apos;re redoing the feathers .
They &apos;re redoing the feathers ?
-What about you ?
-My pants are too small .
Your pants are too small ?
Are you sure ?
What do you do ?
-What do you mean ?
-In the show ?
-Oh , I &apos;m the water lily .
-And you ?
I &apos;m the crane .
Larivière !
What &apos;d I say ?
You have another bird coming in with a flower !
They &apos;re new . They weren &apos;t here yesterday . So what ?
Birds on the right !
Flowers in front !
-Or the audience will be lost .
-As usual ! Let &apos;s go .
-Let &apos;s go to the next act .
-Yes , sir .
&quot; My little angels , &quot; Come to your mother &apos;s breast .
&quot; And you , vile seducer ,
&quot; must face my sword to get her back . &quot; Don &apos;t you dare try to take him from me . &quot; He &apos;s my son . &quot;
Don &apos;t mind me , they &apos;re old memories .
My Lady .
OK , girls , time for the 15th act !
-Legris !
-Yes ? -Ready ? -Yes , sir .
Ladies , you &apos;re holding guns , not syringes .
Continue .
Larivière !
Larivière !
Off the stage !
Can &apos;t you get your girl to sing in tune ?
I tried , but there &apos;s nothing we can do .
She &apos;s our silent partner &apos;s favorite .
You should change your costume , dear . -Blanche !
Costume change . -Yes , ma &apos;am .
Next act !
-Let &apos;s go !
You wouldn &apos;t believe me .
But I won &apos;t tell you , because you &apos;ll print it .
Don &apos;t be rude . He &apos;s a journalist .
Quiet , André .
You wouldn &apos;t believe where we &apos;ve been .
When I look back , it &apos;s been hard for André and me .
We &apos;ve toured the country in unheated , 3rd class trains .
And dirty , stuffy rooms ...
Think he &apos;s interested in that ?
Of course he is . Aren &apos;t you ?
-See ? -Alright , then .
My husband and I met in a show in St. Étienne .
They paid us peanuts , so we didn &apos;t eat every day , as you can imagine . Then there was Maubeuge .
The audience was on both sides of the stage .
We sang for the right side first , then the middle , then the left .
So the left side only heard the end ! -And Limoges !
-Oh , yeah ! We weren &apos;t paid there either , just fed .
The lead actor did the cooking .
You can imagine the food !
We also got coffee and postcard profits , which was nice , right ?
-You know ... It wasn &apos;t always funny at the time .
I was lucky to have my husband .
He &apos;s very talented . Much more so than me .
Be sure to add that .
-No , don &apos;t . -Yes , add it .
Quiet .
Come here .
We &apos;ve never left each other .
We &apos;ve always worked together .
We kept each other &apos;s spirits up .
We &apos;d tell each other our luck would change someday .
We &apos;re in Paris now .
Our act is very good , very original .
-He came up with it .
-I did . He got the idea when we were in the country .
We love the countryside .
-One day ... -There &apos;s no stopping her now !
I have to see the conductor about the cut we made .
-Fine . -Excuse me .
Give me a goodbye kiss !
-There ! -Do you love me ?
-Don &apos;t be mean .
I adore you .
-See you later .
-Yes .
Sorry , what was I saying ?
Right , the country .
We just love the country .
We always planned to buy a house when we would have enough money .
Quiet !
They &apos;re doing a number .
André !
Want some candy ?
André ?
André !
-Yes ?
-Come in .
Have a seat .
Have a cigarette .
Did you practice with the orchestra ?
Yes , ma &apos;am .
There &apos;s no need to call me &quot; ma &apos;am . &quot;
We &apos;re alone .
I &apos;d like to , but it &apos;s a bit complicated .
You &apos;re not only the star , you &apos;re the director .
And there &apos;s my wife to think of .
She might not understand .
I don &apos;t want to hurt her under any circumstances .
It took you a while to come up with that !
Do you love your wife ?
Of course I do .
Why wouldn &apos;t I ?
That &apos;s what I thought .
Ridiculous ! I don &apos;t see how that &apos;s ridiculous .
I &apos;m not the only man who loves his wife .
She didn &apos;t come down with you ?
No , she &apos;s in our dressing room . A journalist is interviewing her about how she got started .
Have some champagne with me .
-No , thank you .
-Yes , it &apos;ll help with your act .
If you were a reasonable young man , André , I &apos;d have a proposition for you .
I &apos;m a reasonable young man .
The boss has found a new guy !
-She can &apos;t help herself .
-She has to try them all .
&quot; André , I have a proposition for you . &quot;
I know what kind !
-Goodbye , ma &apos;am .
-Goodbye . -Where &apos;s Ms. Gary &apos;s room ?
-One floor down .
-More champagne ?
-No , thank you . I have to do my act later .
About that ...
You know , André , you could be in my summer show .
We &apos;d make a lovely couple .
You &apos;d benefit from my name .
I have an idea for a sensational act , one people will talk about .
With your name next to mine , it could be your big break .
I run things around here , so just say the word .
Wouldn &apos;t it be nice , André ?
What do you think ?
I &apos;m going !
Ladies of Louis XIV &apos;s court !
Do I have to drag you down the stairs ?
Got nothing to say ?
I &apos;m not saying no .
Obviously , it would be great .
Let &apos;s talk about it over dinner tonight .
A friendly dinner .
We &apos;ll talk it over .
It &apos;s a date ! It would be a pleasure , but I really can &apos;t , because of my wife .
You don &apos;t have to tell her . You &apos;ll see her afterwards .
Come to my place as soon as you &apos;re done .
No , I really can &apos;t .
Fine .
I won &apos;t mention it again .
Blanche !
Quickly !
This isn &apos;t going to work .
I &apos;ll be going , then .
You &apos;re so clumsy !
It &apos;s not like that at all .
My legs have had enough !
Well , I &apos;ve had 12 costume changes !
Isn &apos;t life grand ?
-Shoot , I broke a nail !
-What time is it ?
2 AM . We &apos;ve been here since noon .
The 14th act is starting !
Ready , Gaby ?
We &apos;re up next .
They finished Louis XIV &apos;s Court and started Babylon Gardens .
It &apos;s about time .
I &apos;m fed up with waiting . The makeup is nice .
Pass me the matches .
I need to tell the orchestra about the cut we made .
I was going down to tell him , but ... I got stopped on the way and I forgot .
We &apos;ll see .
It &apos;s just a rehearsal .
Wish we could get it over with .
Did you tell them about the lighting ?
I &apos;m out of powder .
Can you pass me yours ?
You &apos;re awfully quiet .
What &apos;s wrong ?
Look at me .
What &apos;s wrong , Gaby ?
Did something happen ?
-You went downstairs to see her .
-Me ? I heard you two .
She asked you to be her partner and you had champagne . Then she shut the door , so I couldn &apos;t hear more .
-You &apos;re crazy .
-No , I &apos;m not .
I heard you clearly .
She wants you , but she doesn &apos;t need you .
That &apos;s crazy .
Are you jealous ?
That &apos;s silly .
You know I love you . I &apos;m lucky to have you .
I &apos;d be a fool to be with another woman .
Are you trying to hurt me ?
Haven &apos;t we been happy together ?
Do you want to ruin it all over nothing ?
Over nothing ...
I hate her ! If she tries to split us up , I &apos;ll get her !
Enough !
Are you trying to make me mad ?
Come here .
Look me in the eye .
I love you , only you .
Hear me ?
-Are you sure ? -Of course .
Don &apos;t be silly !
We &apos;re going to be a huge hit .
Our act is great . We &apos;re gonna make a lot of money . I &apos;ll buy you that house in the country .
And if anyone talks about theatre ,
So you won &apos;t talk to her again ?
-No . -She &apos;s ugly .
And old !
She &apos;s 42 !
The costume girl told me .
-42 ?
-And have you seen her hair ?
It &apos;s not real .
It &apos;s a wig . It &apos;s true , her dresser told me .
And that voice ! There &apos;s nothing more grating .
Hardly anyone knows her name .
Well , maybe in a few places ...
I &apos;m just telling you what I think .
And have you seen her legs ? They &apos;re awful !
You &apos;ve got her all figured out !
-You won &apos;t talk to her again ?
-No .
-Promise ? -Yes . I know you .
You can be weak .
-Swear .
-Of course !
No , say &quot; I swear . &quot;
I swear . Happy now ?
Get me a brandy , will you ?
A big one . -A big brandy ?
-Yes .
A big brandy , please .
It &apos;s for my wife .
I don &apos;t want her to fall over .
Great , thanks .
Put it on my tab .
-How &apos;s the act ?
-Good , we &apos;re on soon .
It &apos;s always the same thing . Take this and get my handkerchief .
-Got my fan ?
-What &apos;s this piece ?
-A popular Argentinean song .
-It &apos;s nice .
That &apos;s a costume I could wear .
It &apos;d be a change from feathers . They always cover me in them !
This is too long .
The audience will fall asleep ! Give it a minute , dear .
It just started . Who &apos;s that woman ?
-I don &apos;t like her !
-It &apos;s an original act , though .
It &apos;s not bad .
My handkerchief , Blanche !
She &apos;s still not back ?
What could she be doing ?
There you are !
Thank you .
Stay close , I &apos;ll need you .
-Did you close my door ?
-Yes . Did you lock it ?
Fine , then .
I can &apos;t do it !
She won &apos;t stop talking !
What did you say ?
I &apos;ve had enough ! You should leave !
-Calm down .
-No , I won &apos;t calm down . I heard her what she said about me .
-Enough !
-Let me go !
I don &apos;t like her either !
I &apos;ll take notes from the director . Everyone else should shut up !
Let me go ! She &apos;s jealous !
-Enough !
-She &apos;s jealous !
Get out of here !
I don &apos;t want her in the show !
-But the act is ... -Fine , I &apos;ll take her role .
-Sure .
-You &apos;ll see the difference !
It &apos;s difficult . That &apos;s the final word .
-What am I to you ?
-Everything ! Cut the act or I &apos;m taking her role .
So ?
What do you want me to say ?
Your wife is a problem . -We couldn &apos;t practice .
-But what happened is a problem .
You can &apos;t cut our act .
It &apos;s sure to be a hit ! I &apos;m not the only one in charge .
-Think about your losses .
-There won &apos;t be any .
-You &apos;ll get a severance . -That &apos;s not what worries me .
After all these years , we finally got to Paris .
What can I say , André ?
I feel for you , but there &apos;s nothing I can do .
Go talk to her .
I would if I were you .
-Think so ?
-It &apos;s worth a try .
-Think it &apos;ll work ?
-It &apos;s your only hope .
Fine , I &apos;ll try .
Don &apos;t tell my wife .
You know how she can be .
-I &apos;m counting on you .
Looking for something , sir ?
Ms. Delys &apos;s dressing room .
End of the hall , then up the stairs .
-Legris !
-Yes ? -Leave the set for tomorrow .
Think I &apos;m in for it with the girls ?
Don &apos;t worry , it &apos;ll work out .
Sure , it always does .
One way or another .
Come here , ladies !
You &apos;re finished for tonight !
Be back here at noon tomorrow !
-Yes ?
-Yvette .
We &apos;re waiting on you . -I &apos;m tired .
I &apos;m going home .
-Without dinner ? Not tonight .
I &apos;m going home .
-See you tomorrow .
You ?
-Yes , me .
-How ?
You already got out ?
Already ? Guess the time flew for you .
I got out yesterday .
Why come here ?
-Is that you , Blanche ?
-Yes , ma &apos;am . -Don &apos;t come up .
You can go home .
-Fine , ma &apos;am .
Nice welcome after being gone 5 years .
Cut to the chase .
-A little money .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;m in trouble .
Hope they didn &apos;t cut our act .
Your act is really good .
-That &apos;s what made her mad .
-Exactly .
That awful woman is jealous !
I got it , Gaby . Give her another so she stops .
I &apos;m done , don &apos;t worry .
Thanks .
How &apos;s work , Mr. Bonneau ?
Not great .
You always complain .
Look at that face .
You &apos;d think he was at a funeral !
That &apos;s enough . -Not making enough money ?
-OK , OK .
-Look at these .
-Hardly brandy glasses !
More like thimbles !
-Want another ?
-No , I &apos;m done . -I have to see what happened .
-It &apos;ll be fine .
-As long as they didn &apos;t cut it . -They won &apos;t !
That woman could do anything .
-How much do we owe you ?
-I got it .
-It &apos;s on me . -No .
DON &apos;T WAIT FOR ME .
GO STRAIGHT TO THE HOTEL .
I &apos;LL BE BACK ...
You &apos;re a good friend , you know .
There aren &apos;t many in our field .
That &apos;s why I can &apos;t stand women .
-See you tomorrow !
So what &apos;d they say ?
It &apos;s going to work out . She &apos;s not gonna get an apology .
Certainly not from me . Absolutely not .
What &apos;s this ?
-Where are you going ?
-To see the boss .
-Why ? -He thinks our act needs work .
-What does that mean ?
-I don &apos;t know .
Probably just a few cuts . I &apos;m having dinner with him .
You &apos;re lying .
You &apos;re seeing her !
-Come on !
-I heard you two earlier .
-You &apos;re going !
-Gaby !
You don &apos;t care about me or the act !
-That &apos;s ridiculous ! -I get it now ! You arranged for her to make that scene during our act .
You wanted me to get upset .
It was all planned ! I &apos;m begging you .
Don &apos;t go , André .
Don &apos;t leave me alone .
I &apos;m still upset about earlier .
-You &apos;ve got the wrong idea .
If you go , I don &apos;t want to ever see you again !
Be reasonable .
-I &apos;m late , I have to go .
-She &apos;d better watch out .
She doesn &apos;t know what I can do !
I &apos;m going to talk about our contract !
You don &apos;t care about the contract !
I don &apos;t care !
I don &apos;t care who hears me !
She doesn &apos;t know what I &apos;m capable of !
André !
I don &apos;t know , Mr. Larivière . Have you seen the poster ?
Because I have . I needed a microscope to find my name !
That &apos;s awful , young man , just awful .
Say , Flamberger . Do you remember the infamous parade in the last show ?
That night , the boss said ,
&quot; Larivière , you don &apos;t even know how to climb stairs ! &quot;
I &apos;ve lived on the 6th floor for 30 years .
Young people know nothing about theater .
Nothing . I played the lead in all kinds of plays in Carcassonne .
Let me tell you one thing .
It &apos;ll be beneficial to you , young man .
When I was in &quot; Léonard ou les Égoutiers , &quot; there was a chorus in act II .
Remember ?
The famous chorus ! &quot; Sewer workers are good men . &quot;
&quot; No one can refute that . &quot;
That &apos;s what we sang back then .
It was at least as good as what they sing nowadays .
-Where &apos;s the manager ?
-On his rounds .
What &apos;s my boss up to ?
Everybody &apos;s gone at this hour .
It &apos;s always the same thing !
I like theater , but I &apos;m fed up !
She &apos;s tough to please .
I get yelled at all the time . Don &apos;t complain .
You have a good job !
Think so ?
I &apos;ll wait until my Christmas bonus , then I &apos;m quitting !
Young man , theater is a thing of the past .
So are actors .
Did you see me in &quot; Les Oubliettes du Vieux Louvre &quot; ?
What a fond memory .
In &quot; Le Crétin de la Montagne , &quot; I played the idiot , of course .
You should have seen the audience .
&quot; Sire , I &apos;m waiting for the ring . &quot;
&quot; To do what , Bertrand ? &quot;
&quot; To do what ? &quot;
&quot; To die on the day the Emperor dies . &quot;
&quot; They won &apos;t stain ... &quot; &quot; these tears . &quot;
If you &apos;d only seen it , young man .
There isn &apos;t the same feeling anymore . There isn &apos;t the same artistic satisfaction .
Think of the plays we did ...
-Bonneau !
He &apos;s not here ?
-He &apos;s on his rounds , sir . Larivière , tell him the fire department is coming tomorrow .
-What &apos;s that ?
-Help !
Help !
Help !
What &apos;s wrong , Bonneau ?
-A killer !
-Who ? Ms. Delys ... in her dressing room !
Call the police .
-Is she dead ?
-Yes .
How awful !
-Go take a look !
-Yes , sir .
Let &apos;s go . -Take the lead , Bonneau .
-No , I can &apos;t .
There are 6 of us !
Yvette Delys ... muddled ... molded ... murdered !
It &apos;s terrible , just terrible !
She &apos;s in here .
There &apos;s blood ! Oh , I can &apos;t look !
-Is she dead ? -Call the police !
Looks like she defended herself .
-Did it just happen ? -The killer must still be here !
Was she strangled ?
-Who &apos;s there ?
-Don &apos;t say anything !
Oh , it &apos;s you , Flamberger .
OK .
Get the doctor .
-Was she strangled ?
-Don &apos;t touch !
-I &apos;m not !
-That knife ...
-What about it ?
It &apos;s Gaby &apos;s knife ! Yes , from her act .
-It does look like hers .
-Don &apos;t touch !
-Hello .
-Is this 2237 ?
-What ?
-Is this 2237 ? -Yes .
-So , it &apos;s the theater ?
Yes . Is Ms. Delys still there ?
No , she isn &apos;t .
-She &apos;s not home , either .
-Is this André ?
Yes .
What ? We found Ms. Delys dead in her dressing room .
-What ?
-She &apos;s dead .
She was stabbed .
By whom ?
We don &apos;t know , looks like revenge .
-I can &apos;t believe it . -Yes . The knife looks like ...
-Hello ?
Hello , hello . Get me the police station .
Who are you ?
Let go !
No need to yell .
Let go !
Help !
André !
-Help ! -Get her to police headquarters .
GABRIELLE DELANGE ACCUSED OF HOMICIDE
We shall proceed with the cross-examination .
I advise you to follow the proceedings closely and to listen carefully to the charges brought against you .
Remember , each of your answers will carry significant weight .
Your parents lived in Bordeaux and loved you very much .
They spent a considerable amount to ensure you had an excellent education .
In spite of that , you left home without any explanation at the age of 16 .
My authoritarian father wanted me to marry a man I didn &apos;t love .
To escape your father , you saw fit to run away with some 1,100 francs .
That proves 2 things , Gabrielle Delange .
Firstly , from a very young age , you rebelled against discipline .
Secondly , you already lacked scruples .
I &apos;ve always regretted leaving ...
My father was inflexible .
I had to obey him or leave .
I tried to obey him , but the man I was to marry was an imposter .
I wanted to tell my parents , but my father refused to listen .
That &apos;s why I left , but the money was mine .
I &apos;d been saving up since my childhood .
I &apos;d like to inform the jury that the reasons given by the defendant are not true .
She , herself , would admit that her father did not believe her .
This proves that Ms. Delange was accustomed to lying from a young age and her father no longer trusted her .
I &apos;d like the jury to take into account that this information about my client was taken from a few neighbors and should not be taken seriously .
Your Honor , would the defendant please remove her hat .
Let &apos;s move on to a later date in St. Étienne .
You met André Robert , with whom you now live .
You call him your husband , but you &apos;ve never been married .
-No , your Honor . -But you live together .
You &apos;re both dancers . Let &apos;s skip over the years prior to your time in Paris .
You &apos;re currently preparing a pantomime act .
You wear a costume in it .
The costume includes a knife attached to your belt in a leather sheath , correct ?
-Yes , your Honor . -Is it also true that in the pantomime , you use the knife frequently ? And at the end of the act , you throw it with such precision that it pierces the chest of a dummy , which is supposed to represent your partner .
-Yes .
-Here are 2 established facts .
Please listen carefully . On the night of September 14 , rehearsals were underway at the Folies Montmartre for the winter show .
That night , you had a violent argument with the victim .
Shortly after , Ms. Delys was found dead in her dressing room , stabbed to death with your knife .
The weapon had been thrown at the victim with the same precision and accuracy as in your act .
Although gravely wounded by the knife that had pierced her , the victim tried to defend herself with a small revolver .
She shot one bullet at her assailant , later found in the paneling .
Yvette Delys was fatally stabbed and the killer got away , leaving your knife in the wound .
Gabrielle Delange , that killer was you .
It &apos;s not true !
It wasn &apos;t me !
It &apos;s a horrible accusation !
Why did you arm yourself with a knife before going to the victim &apos;s dressing room ?
I wasn &apos;t armed with a knife , your Honor .
I had it on me when I left my dressing room .
It was part of my costume , but I didn &apos;t notice .
When I got to Ms. Delys &apos;s room , I didn &apos;t think about having it .
-You didn &apos;t think about it ?
-No . Yet , you threatened the victim with it during your interaction .
No , I didn &apos;t threaten her .
I &apos;m going to have to contradict you .
A witness who was passing by during your conversation with Ms. Delys claimed he heard someone yell ,
&quot; Throw this knife ! &quot; It &apos;s true , I threatened her , but only with words .
I swear , I never used my knife .
I &apos;ll explain .
I love my husband .
We &apos;re not married , but it &apos;s like we are .
We &apos;ve been together so long .
We &apos;ve had good days and bad days , but we &apos;re happy because we love each other .
I sensed this woman wanted to take him away , so I went to try to work things out .
I asked her what right she had to take him away from me , to shatter our existence .
I wanted her to promise to leave him alone , but she just laughed .
When I saw she was mocking me ,
I lost my head . I went towards her .
I might &apos;ve made a gesture that she took as a threat .
But if I did , I didn &apos;t realize it .
I swear , I never threatened her with my knife .
Never !
How can you explain it , then ? When she screamed , I realized she was afraid of the knife .
So I threw it on the ground .
You &apos;ve admitted you threatened the victim , but only with words .
What were those words ? I don &apos;t remember exactly .
I was beside myself .
You don &apos;t remember . That defense isn &apos;t new and it won &apos;t get you anywhere .
It &apos;s not a defense , your Honor .
It &apos;s the truth expressed by someone incapable of lying .
Or a convenient method for avoiding a question .
That &apos;s a sly use of psychology to sway the jury .
No , I &apos;ll leave it to you to make up stories that tug at the heartstrings of gossips .
Please note that the prosecutor has called the jury &quot; gossips . &quot;
The matter is closed .
I &apos;ll ask you for the last time to remember your words .
They were insults , whatever came into my head .
You don &apos;t always remember what you say in anger .
I knew my husband was at her place .
To scare her , I said I &apos;d keep her from going there by force .
Once I said that , I stopped . She said , &quot; Are you crazy ?
&quot; Why would I stay here if your husband &apos;s at my place ?
&quot; Work it out for yourselves . &quot; Then she turned around .
I didn &apos;t know what to say . I wasn &apos;t expecting indifference .
I didn &apos;t know how to answer .
I was upset , I didn &apos;t even have it in me to cry .
I thought I might faint . So I left her alone and she slammed the door behind me .
You told investigators you couldn &apos;t remember what time you left the theater .
The building manager , Mr. Bonneau , claimed he saw you leave 10 minutes before the crime was discovered .
The crime was discovered at 4 : 05 AM . So you must &apos;ve left the theater at 3 : 55 AM .
That &apos;s impossible !
I left well before then .
He must have lied !
Why would he have lied ?
I saw the time at the Quai d &apos;Orsay train station .
It was definitely 4 AM . It &apos;s more than a 5 minute walk .
You remember that now ?
Anyway , let &apos;s move on . What were you doing at the Quai d &apos;Orsay station at 4 AM ?
I was completely distraught .
I didn &apos;t want to go back to an empty room without my husband , so I walked around .
Yes , along the Seine .
Along the Seine ?
I was going to jump in .
You were about to kill yourself by jumping into the river , yet you noticed the time ?
Very impressive , ma &apos;am .
It &apos;s the truth . I was looking into the water when I noticed the clock &apos;s reflection .
It felt like someone was watching over me .
As I looked at it , the clock chimed 4 : 00 .
So you immediately decided not to kill yourself ?
Why did you change your mind ?
You then went back to the hotel , where you were arrested .
That was about 5 : 30 AM .
I walked around , trying to calm down .
-Did you run into anyone ?
-No , your Honor . You walked around Paris for an hour and a half without running into anyone ?
You know that type of defense ...
WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENSE
AFTER AN INTENSE INTERROGATION OF THE DEFENDANT , SEVERAL WITNESSES TESTIFIED , SPEAKING HIGHLY OF THE VICTIM .
THE FINAL WITNESSES WILL TESTIFY TODAY .
A VERDICT IS EXPECTED THIS EVENING .
I must defend the defendant &apos;s rights .
I firmly believe in my client &apos;s innocence .
It was never a question ... It &apos;s easy to be disdainful -of the defense &apos;s rights !
-I &apos;m respecting your rights .
-Only in words !
-In deed as well ! You only respect the form !
You can &apos;t claim for an instant ...
Enough , Counselors . It &apos;s been insinuated that the prosecutor has failed to respect the defendant &apos;s rights .
However , throughout this hearing , he has shown the utmost impartiality .
Your Honor , I commend the prosecutor for his impartiality .
The doctor has just described in detail how he believes the victim was struck with a large knife from 2 meters away .
The weapon was thrown with so much force that it caused a deadly wound to the thorax .
Dr. Louis , please look at my client .
Ms. Delange , please stand up .
I have a question for you .
You said the weapon was thrown with extreme force .
Given my client &apos;s physical stature , do you believe she &apos;s capable of throwing the weapon with such force ?
-No , I do not .
-Doctor .
Would you agree that , with sufficient practice , anyone , including a woman , could attain such force , particularly if that person was very angry ?
Yes , it &apos;s possible .
For the record , the prosecutor has claimed the crime could have been committed by anyone .
Provided they could throw a knife as skillfully as the defendant .
That isn &apos;t impossible .
Does the defendant have anything to add to this testimony ?
Does the jury , prosecution or defense have any questions ?
No , your Honor .
You &apos;re dismissed , doctor .
Call witness Georges Barreau .
Mr. Barreau , you testified earlier that as cashier at the Folies Montmartre , on the night of the crime , you brought the victim 20,000 f .
At her request , you brought that amount to her in her dressing room .
Can you tell us the exact time you were in her dressing room ?
Approximately 3 AM .
When you left her dressing room at 3 AM , did you run into anyone ?
Ms. Delange was on her way out .
She went right back to her room .
Did her attitude seem suspicious ?
Perhaps .
I didn &apos;t pay attention .
Did you notice a knife in her hand ?
-I didn &apos;t have it !
-I didn &apos;t notice .
Ms. Delange , when you entered the victim &apos;s dressing room , did you see the money the cashier had given her ?
No , I wasn &apos;t paying attention .
The 20,000 f has never been found .
Mr. Barreau ... At the dress rehearsal , which involved a number of people , some of whom may have questionable characters , did anyone see you bring the money to the victim ?
I put the money in my pocket and brought it to Ms. Delys , so no one could have seen me .
Your Honor , in the interest of getting to the truth , I &apos;d like to question Mr. Bonneau .
Call him in .
When the victim called you to send the cashier , what time was it ?
Around 2 : 30 AM .
Are you sure ?
Yes , sir , 2 : 30 , maybe a bit earlier .
-It couldn &apos;t have been . -Why not ?
I was in the theater at 2 : 30 , watching the rehearsal .
On my way to my office to get my hat , I noticed it was 3 AM .
That &apos;s when I got the call .
Mr. Bonneau , we have a witness claiming it was 3 AM .
It couldn &apos;t have been .
That &apos;s when I was serving Ms. Delange at the bar .
She had 3 brandies . She was very upset and angry .
She was saying , &quot; That woman is jealous .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;ll do to her . &quot;
You &apos;ve already told us that .
You accused the defendant of a suspicious animosity .
However , one point has been contradicted by a witness whose honesty is above suspicion .
No more than his own ! He &apos;s also under oath .
I won &apos;t allow anyone to question his honesty !
Does the defendant have anything to add ?
Does the jury , the defense or the prosecution have anything to add ?
-No , your Honor .
-Call the next witness .
Larivière !
Larivière !
Your full name , age and occupation ?
-Désiré Larivière , 74 .
-Occupation ?
Former lead actor in all genres .
Following that , a diction professor for 1 month , and , temporarily , assistant stage manager at the Folies Montmartre .
One has to make a living .
You live at 47 Trois-Couronnes .
You aren &apos;t a relative or employee of the defendant ?
Raise your right hand .
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth ?
I swear , your Honor .
-Only &quot; I swear . &quot;
-I swear . Proceed .
&quot; Beware , my son , of accusing the innocent .
&quot; The gods , both fair and good , will look out for their defense .
&quot; By uncovering the facts ,
&quot; judges and witnesses will discover the truth .
- &quot; The gods ... &quot;
-Excuse me . Are you reciting verse ?
Exactly , your Honor .
It &apos;s in the second act ...
You &apos;re not on stage .
Tell us what you know about the crime .
Where were you on September 15 at 3 AM ?
Pardon ?
Where were you when the crime was committed ?
-Pardon ? -Address the jury .
Er ...
On the night of ...
Where was I ?
That &apos;s a funny question .
On the night of ...
Oh , I remember !
I was at the bar , having a drink with a friend , Flamberger .
He &apos;s Alsatian , your Honor .
We were at the bar .
A drink from time to time takes the edge off .
It doesn &apos;t make you an alcoholic .
I was there with Flamberger .
He &apos;s also an artist , a great one , actually .
He hasn &apos;t been successful , but we &apos;re not all successful , your Honor .
Otherwise ...
Please stick to the facts .
Yes , your Honor .
I understand .
At the time , I was telling him a story about my past .
So , obviously ...
Er ...
Let &apos;s finish this up !
Then what ?
Then what ?
That &apos;s it .
What do you mean ?
-That &apos;s all .
Yes , your Honor .
That &apos;s all .
Oh , yeah !
I was having a drink with Flamberger .
We were having a drink . Then , all of a sudden , we heard screams .
That &apos;s the truth , your Honor .
We heard noises in the night .
Screams ! Screams , I tell you !
So , everybody went to look .
But I , your Honor , I stayed back alone .
-That &apos;s it .
And ?
-That &apos;s all .
-That &apos;s all you know ?
I swear .
Fine , take a seat .
Thank you . No , thank you , your Honor .
Call the next witness .
Mr. Larivière ...
The judge certainly looked the part .
André Robert !
André Robert !
Your full name , age and occupation ?
André Robert , 30 , artist .
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth ?
Raise your right hand and say , &quot; I swear . &quot; -I swear .
-Lower your hand .
I swore you in because you aren &apos;t legally married to the defendant .
We &apos;re aware of your situation .
Please don &apos;t let your feelings for her impede the truth .
Proceed with your testimony .
I have nothing to say , your Honor .
-I was ...
-Address the jury .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
But I know she &apos;s innocent !
She couldn &apos;t have committed this crime .
I know her after 8 years together .
Stick to the facts directly related to the crime and , again , address the jury .
I &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s upsetting to see her this way .
I don &apos;t know
I &apos;d left the theater , but I know she &apos;s innocent .
We had an argument that night , a rather serious one , but it was my fault .
I know she gets jealous and I should &apos;ve listened to her .
I hope she can forgive me . It was my fault she was upset .
I &apos;d like to repair things here .
Please forgive me .
I forgave you long ago .
This isn &apos;t your fault .
But if I &apos;d told you the truth , if I hadn &apos;t ... Please tell us what you know .
Your Honor , she couldn &apos;t have done this !
That night , she tried to keep me from going .
If I &apos;d listened , we &apos;d have left together and you &apos;d know she wasn &apos;t guilty .
You can &apos;t convict her without proof .
It wasn &apos;t me .
I didn &apos;t do it .
It wasn &apos;t me !
This testimony adds nothing .
His protests can &apos;t refute the mounting evidence .
I &apos;d like to remind the jury how often the defense has endured unjustified attacks from the prosecution .
-My client ... -Your client is a great actress . I &apos;m sure some of her tears are real , but her exaggerated emotions are characteristic of her trade .
How dare you say that ! She &apos;s in tears and has claimed her innocence since her arrest .
She keeps saying she didn &apos;t do it . How can you say such a thing ?
Is her paleness acting too ?
And her tears ? Her sobs ? Her weight loss ?
Is that acting ?
You can &apos;t mistake her sincerity !
Prosecutor , you &apos;re trying to sway this impartial jury to convict the defendant by trying to convince them all of this is acting !
Do you have anything to add ?
Yes , I mentioned something during the investigation , but nothing &apos;s been done about it .
That night , I ran into a man hiding backstage .
Yes , you mentioned it during the investigation .
He was acting strange , like I &apos;d caught him .
I asked him what he wanted .
He said Yvette Delys &apos;s room .
-So I directed him .
-And ? Why haven &apos;t they found this man ?
No one else saw the man you claim to have met .
He was lurking about , looking worried he &apos;d be caught .
What was he doing there ?
Why was he hiding ?
I &apos;m sure he &apos;s the killer . I &apos;ve done all I can to find him .
I have people still looking for him .
Why go to Yvette Delys &apos;s room ?
Why hide ? You &apos;ve already asked these questions .
We couldn &apos;t find him .
But I saw him .
How do you know he &apos;s not the killer ?
You &apos;re here to answer questions , not ask them , Mr. Robert .
A full investigation was done .
You &apos;ve done your best to find this man .
However , he hasn &apos;t been found .
If he can &apos;t be found , he likely doesn &apos;t exist .
You &apos;re excused .
Take the defendant away .
Hearing adjourned .
-Will it be over tonight ?
-It &apos;s likely . There are a few more witnesses , but they &apos;ve agreed to finish tonight .
Thanks . It was a good show , very good , indeed .
However , it could &apos;ve been better .
When we put on &quot; Roger La Honte &quot; in Nevers , there was a courtroom scene .
Of course , I played Noirville .
André !
I think we found him !
Nénette found him .
Come on !
-Where ? -I &apos;ll take you .
It &apos;s time !
-Is it him ?
-Yes .
Come on !
Let &apos;s go !
Why are you looking at me like that ?
It &apos;s him !
He &apos;s the killer !
No , I &apos;m not !
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
-You don &apos;t ?
-No . Remember me from the theater on the night of the crime ?
-It wasn &apos;t me !
-You &apos;re coming with us .
-Where ? -Court !
What for ?
-You &apos;re the killer !
-No , I &apos;m innocent !
She says she doesn &apos;t know , that she doesn &apos;t remember .
Regardless of what the defense says , this isn &apos;t about psychology .
That girl is a killer !
She killed out of cowardice .
She ran into the shadows , forgetting about the weapon , the weapon she &apos;d thrown so forcefully , which penetrated so deeply , it killed the victim instantly .
The victim &apos;s death was swift and rapid .
She &apos;s not only a killer , she &apos;s also a thief !
Gentlemen of the jury , you &apos;re about to hear a defense argued by a lawyer who raised the pitch of this hearing .
He &apos;ll likely talk about passion over reason and blinding jealousy .
He may even allude to the specter of judicial error .
Don &apos;t let him instill doubt in you .
You &apos;ve brought here a respect for justice and the strength of your opinion .
I ask you to resist sentimentality .
Remember , Ms. Delange is , and always has been , an actress .
Her claims of innocence , her tears and her lies are all an act to try to sway you .
Moreover , this woman didn &apos;t even come up with an alibi .
She &apos;s too smart not to think her lie would be discovered .
&quot; It wasn &apos;t me .
I didn &apos;t do it . I &apos;m innocent . &quot;
Lies !
This woman is a liar !
She &apos;s tried to appear mysterious in an attempt to create doubt in your minds .
Don &apos;t fall into her trap .
Weigh the evidence and find her guilty , as she deserves by answering yes to the questions you &apos;re asked .
Justice must prevail .
The truth must come out .
Do not be trapped into feeling pity or mercy .
We live in a time when too many take justice into their own hands .
Don &apos;t confuse pity with weakness .
The killer is here . A weak verdict on your part would mean a breach in the ramparts built to protect our society .
Your weakness would only encourage future crimes .
I &apos;ve fulfilled my duties . I ask that you do the same .
Now for the defense .
Your Honor ... Before giving my closing argument , I &apos;d like to call a new witness , of whom we were just made aware .
Sir , the hearing is over .
Yes , but the verdict isn &apos;t in , so the debate is still open .
His testimony may have a major impact for my client .
Prosecutor , do you object to hearing this new testimony ?
Call the witness .
Your full name , age and occupation ?
Henri Capelle , 41 .
Occupation ?
None .
You &apos;re not a relative or employee of the defendant ?
I didn &apos;t swear you in because you weren &apos;t on the witness list .
The jury will only use your testimony for informational purposes .
What do you know about the crime committed at the Folies Montmartre ?
I don &apos;t know anything .
Where were you on the night of September 14 ?
-I was home .
-That &apos;s a lie , your Honor !
He &apos;s the man I saw backstage !
Remain quiet or I &apos;ll clear the room .
You said you were home . Where do you live ?
I live at 18 Goutte d &apos;Or .
-But at that time ...
-At that time ?
When the crime was committed , I wasn &apos;t home .
You should be careful what you say .
You seem unaware of the serious allegations made against you .
You were seen in the theatre on the night of the crime . -You appeared to be hiding .
-Yes .
I might as well spill it .
It &apos;ll do me good .
I went to the theatre that night to see Yvette Delys .
She was my wife .
-Your wife ? -Yes .
We were married 12 years ago .
She didn &apos;t want anyone to know because as a successful actress , it would hinder her from building her career , etc .
Anyway .
It was fine with me because she brought in a lot of money .
I didn &apos;t have anything to do with the crime , though .
If you &apos;re innocent , as you claim , in spite of being seen near the victim &apos;s dressing room and clearly being sought after , why didn &apos;t you go to the authorities on your own ?
I can explain .
I know the justice system .
After 5 years in prison , you learn a thing or two .
I figured if I came forward ...
Since I was seen in the area the night my wife died and I have a police record , and all that , they &apos;d pin it on me for sure .
They wouldn &apos;t believe me and I &apos;d be finished !
I &apos;m not impressed with your opinion .
And you should watch your language . Let &apos;s move on .
You claim you went to your wife for money .
-Did she give you any ? -Yes , 5,000 f .
The theater cashier claimed he gave her 20,000 f .
I &apos;d asked for 20,000 , but she only gave me 5,000 .
I said it wasn &apos;t much and I &apos;d be back soon .
So , the victim kept 15,000 f ?
Yes , she put it on her vanity .
If I were dishonest , I could &apos;ve swiped it all .
Did you see the manager when you came in ?
No , he wasn &apos;t at his desk .
He wasn &apos;t at his desk ?
Your Honor , I &apos;d like to question the building manager .
Call Mr. Bonneau .
Did you ever leave your desk the night of the crime ?
I watched a bit of the rehearsal .
You &apos;re in a position of trust . You &apos;re supposed to guard the artist entrance . You left to watch the show rehearsals ?
I &apos;m not impressed with how you handle your job .
You could be accused of being an accessory to the murder .
Me ?
What do you have to say ?
I don &apos;t know . You asked so many questions .
I don &apos;t speak as well as you .
I didn &apos;t understand half of it .
-You didn &apos;t ? -No .
Then I &apos;ll make myself clearer .
Here &apos;s another question .
The witness here present , whom you didn &apos;t see come in . -Did you see him leave ? -Yes .
Pardon ?
-You saw me leave ? -Of course .
I was already back at my desk .
-You were at your desk ? -Yes .
I saw you when you left .
You &apos;re a liar !
How could you see me from your desk when I left through the public entrance ?
How &apos;s that ?
My wife didn &apos;t want anyone to see me .
She took me through the theater to the main entrance on the street .
How could you see me , then ?
How can you explain that ?
Perhaps I &apos;m mistaken .
Where were you ?
I may be mistaken .
Maybe I was on my rounds .
You discovered the crime on your rounds ? Yes , your Honor .
When I got to Ms. Delys &apos;s room , the door was ajar and the lights were on .
I waited a minute , but I didn &apos;t hear anything .
I thought she might &apos;ve left with the lights on .
So , I knocked on the door and went in .
That &apos;s when I saw her with the knife on the floor . She didn &apos;t move .
I got scared and ran to get the others .
-You said all that before .
-Excuse me , your Honor .
You said the lights were on when you reached the victim &apos;s room ? Yes , sir .
Then how could they be off when the driver went in ?
What ?
I have another question .
You must &apos;ve heard a gunshot on your rounds .
It &apos;s been established that the victim shot her assailant before being stabbed .
The bullet was found in the paneling .
-You didn &apos;t hear a gunshot ? -No , I didn &apos;t hear anything .
Really ?
You were very close by .
I &apos;m hard of hearing , sir .
It &apos;s not an important detail .
Your Honor , I &apos;d like your permission to perform a reenactment of the crime .
This is a sketch of the victim &apos;s room .
I strongly object to this last-minute demonstration .
This isn &apos;t a theater , it &apos;s a French courtroom ! The defense is overstepping its bounds .
Prosecutor , you cannot restrict the defense &apos;s rights .
Your own rights may be restricted , but a lawyer &apos;s rights may not .
The average lawyer puts his energy into his argument , but it &apos;s in the hands of his adversary .
It &apos;s his right and I won &apos;t allow it to be compromised !
My client &apos;s freedom and , perhaps , her life are at stake .
I &apos;m about to save her and have her charges dismissed .
She &apos;s not a criminal and I &apos;ll prove it .
Gentlemen of the jury , this is the scene ,
the scene of the crime the witnesses testified about .
the scene only the killer knows about since he fled it .
He fled unseen and escaped punishment for his crime .
I &apos;ll present you with the scene right now .
I &apos;ll go back to the night of the crime .
I &apos;m backstage at the theater , deserted at this time of night . It &apos;s full of dark corners .
I &apos;m walking behind Yvette Delys . She &apos;s undressed , wearing only this kimono .
She &apos;s leading her husband , who she wants to hide , to the exit . He escapes unseen .
Yvette Delys then heads back towards her dressing room . She walks down the same dark hallways to her brightly lit dressing room , where she &apos;d left the money , the 15,000 f we talked about earlier , foolishly left on her vanity .
The 15,000 f attracts one man &apos;s attention .
He sees the bills through her open door . He &apos;s fascinated by and drawn to them .
Thinking he &apos;s alone , since he doesn &apos;t hear anything , he tiptoes his way in .
Holding his breath , he takes the money .
He wants to make a run for it , but he hears a noise .
It &apos;s the victim &apos;s footsteps heading towards the room .
What can he do ?
He &apos;ll be caught !
He rushes into the back room , which doesn &apos;t have a door .
That &apos;s when his eyes fall on a knife .
This weapon , which the defendant foolishly tossed . This weapon , left there , as if by evil design , was at his fingertips .
Yvette Delys suddenly comes back into the dressing room .
She walks into the back room , unaware of the danger .
Suddenly the lights go out .
In the darkness , she can &apos;t see anything .
She only hears her heart racing with fear .
A minute passes , then several more .
Then she hears footsteps .
He brushes past her as he runs to the door .
&quot; Who &apos;s there ? &quot; she cries . No answer .
She has a feeling that someone , perhaps armed , is hiding in the shadows .
So , she grabs her revolver .
Would you take this , please ?
She points her ivory-handled revolver into the dark , in the direction of the noise she heard , and she shoots .
He &apos;s the killer !
I remember doing a court scene in a play in St. Amand back in 1876 .
Yes , sir .
I was young and handsome then ...
Jennifer Donovan TV5 Québec Canada
You must do your best tonight , be on your toes , men .
There &apos;s an honored guest tonight . He &apos;s one of those men , who are being feted by the smart-set .
We &apos;ll see that he gets what he deserves .
Treat him as they do a king , in manner royal .
Like a subject to a king , you must be loyal . On this you must have your hearts set .
We &apos;ll do nothing to get on his nerves .
Again I mention :
Be on your toes , men .
He craves attention , he &apos;s one of those men .
We will give him just what he deserves .
Oh , Hives ...
- Yes , Mrs. Rittenhouse ?
I &apos;d like to reassign the rooms .
- Very good , madam .
Mr. Chandler should have the Blue suite .
Captain Spaulding , as guest of honor , gets the Green duplex with 2 baths .
Two ?
- Yes .
I think the Captain would like 2 baths , don &apos;t you ?
If he &apos;s just returned from Africa , he may need 2 baths .
Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler .
Mrs. Rittenhouse !
Well , I ...
Mr. Chandler !
So nice to see you .
- The famous Beaugard , as promised .
How can I ever express my gratitude ?
- Oh , &apos; tis nothing .
Nothing ? You return from Europe with a masterpiece worth $ 100,000 , and instead of displaying it yourself , you let me unveil it at my party for Captain Spaulding .
You call that nothing ?
- Mrs. Rittenhouse , I ...
Please remove it to where it will be exhibited .
- Very good , sir .
And very careful , please .
You think that is something ?
I would do much more for you .
You are a very beautiful woman .
- No , no , Mr. Chandler .
Well , maybe I &apos;m wrong .
- What ?
Please do not go . I love you .
- I know .
Mr. Chandler , now look ...
Hello , Mother . Playing house ?
Well , if you &apos;ll pardon me .
Have you seen Johnny Parker ?
- Forget him .
Think more of our guest .
Your problem is you don &apos;t take these social affairs seriously .
What would you suggest , Mom ?
Suicide ?
I would suggest ...
That must be him .
- Captain Spaulding has arrived .
What a pleasure ! I &apos;m so glad .
Friends , Captain Spaulding has arrived .
At last we are to meet him , the famous Captain Spaulding .
From climates hot and scalding , the Captain has arrived .
Most heartily we &apos;ll greet him , with plain and fancy cheering , until he &apos;s hard of hearing . The Captain has arrived .
The Captain has arrived .
Mr. Horatio W. Jamison , Field Secretary of Captain Spaulding .
The Captain insists on these conditions under which he camps here .
In one thing he is very strict . He wants his women young and picked . As for men , he won &apos;t have any tramps here .
As for men , he won &apos;t have any tramps here .
The men must all be very old , the women warm , the champagne cold .
It &apos;s under these conditions that he camps here .
I &apos;m announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding .
He &apos;s announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding .
Oh dear . He is coming .
At last he &apos;s here .
Well , what do I owe you ?
From Africa to here , $ 1.85 ?
Outrageous !
I told you not to take me through Australia .
That &apos;s criminal .
Turn around . I want to see your license plates .
I &apos;ll attend to you later .
You &apos;re one of the most beautiful women I &apos;ve seen .
Doesn &apos;t say much .
Captain , Rittenhouse Manor is entirely at your disposal .
I &apos;m grateful for this magnificent washout , ah , turnout .
Now I &apos;d like to say a few words .
Hello , I must be going .
I cannot stay . I came to say I must be going .
I &apos;m glad I came , but just the same , I must be going .
But you must stay .
If you should go away , you &apos;ll spoil this party I am throwing .
I &apos;ll stay a week or two , I &apos;ll stay the summer through , but I am telling you ,
I must be going .
Before you go , will you oblige us and tell us of your deeds so glowing ?
I &apos;ll do anything you say .
In fact I &apos;ll even stay .
- Good .
But I must be going .
There &apos;s something I would like to say that he &apos;s too modest to relay .
The Captain is a moral man . Sometimes he finds it trying .
This I emphasize with stress .
I never drink unless ... somebody &apos;s buying .
The Captain is a very moral man .
If he hears anything obscene , he &apos;ll naturally repel it .
I hate a dirty joke , unless it &apos;s told by someone who knows how to tell it .
The Captain is a very moral man .
Hooray for Captain Spaulding , the African explorer .
Did someone call me Shnorrer ?
He went into the jungle , where the monkeys throw nuts .
If I stay here , I &apos;ll go nuts .
He puts all his reliance in courage and defiance and risks his life for science .
He is the only white man to cover every acre .
He puts all his reliance in courage and defiance and risks his life for science .
Hooray for Captain Spaulding , the African explorer .
He put his name on dying fame and that is why we say :
Hooray , hooray , hooray .
My friends , I &apos;m highly gratified of this display of effusion .
And I want you to know ...
My friends , I &apos;m highly gratified of this display of effusion ...
My friends , I &apos;m highly gratified of this display of effusion .
Hooray for Captain Spaulding ...
Well , somebody &apos;s got to do it .
It is indeed a great honor to welcome you to my poor home .
Oh , it isn &apos;t so bad .
Wait .
You &apos;re right , it &apos;s one of the frowziest joints I &apos;ve ever seen .
The wallpaper !
You &apos;re letting this place run down .
You &apos;re not getting the class of people you need .
These people look like you .
Let &apos;s put up a sign , &quot; Under new management &quot; .
We set up a 75-cent meal that knocks their eyes out .
Then we can charge whatever we want .
Sign here and give me a check for $ 1,500 .
This insurance policy provides for your little one and your old age , which will be here in a few weeks .
I feel that the time has come , the walrus said ...
You stand before me as one of the bravest men of all times .
Alright , I &apos;ll do that .
In the dark forests of Africa , you dared all dangers .
You mind if I don &apos;t smoke ?
Fearlessly you have blazed new trails , scoffed at the lions &apos; roar and the cannibals &apos; tom-toms .
Says you .
Never once in all those months did your footsteps falter .
Cowardice is unknown to you . Fear is not in you .
Pardon me , a caterpillar , Captain .
The caterpillar must have frightened him .
Oh dear .
Don &apos;t just stand there , get the whiskey .
Where &apos;s the whiskey ?
- In my little black bag , in the right-hand corner .
Signor Emanuel Ravelli .
How are you ?
Where &apos;s the dining room ?
- This is a surprise .
I used to know an Emanuel Ravelli who looked exactly like you .
I am Emanuel Ravelli .
- You &apos;re Emanuel Ravelli ?
No wonder you look like him .
But there is a resemblance .
And he thinks I look alike .
- If so , it &apos;s a tough break for you .
You are one of the musicians ?
Aren &apos;t you due tomorrow ?
Tomorrow &apos;s too quick .
Lucky they didn &apos;t come yesterday .
- We charge for yesterday , too .
What do you get an hour ?
For playing , we get $ 10 an hour .
- And for not playing ?
$ 12 an hour .
- Clip me off a piece of that .
For rehearsing , we make special rate . That &apos;s $ 15 an hour .
For rehearsing ?
And for not rehearsing ?
You couldn &apos;t afford it .
If we don &apos;t rehearse , we don &apos;t play .
And if we don &apos;t play , that runs into money .
How much for running into an open manhole ?
- Just a cover charge .
Well , drop in some time .
- Sewer .
Well , we cleaned that up pretty well .
- Let &apos;s see how we stand .
Flat-footed .
Yesterday we didn &apos;t come .
You remember ?
That &apos;s $ 300 .
Yesterday you didn &apos;t come . That &apos;s $ 300 ?
Oh , that &apos;s reasonable .
Today we did come ...
- You owe us 100 .
I bet I &apos;m gonna lose on the deal .
Tomorrow we leave .
That &apos;s worth ...
- A million dollars .
Yeah , that &apos;s alright for me , but I got a partner .
The Professor .
The gates swung open and a Fig Newton entered .
How do you do ?
Goodness .
You haven &apos;t got chocolate , have you ?
He &apos;s got everything .
- Hives , take the Professor &apos;s hat and coat .
And send for the fumigators .
Don &apos;t you see that there are ladies present ?
Put that hat down .
What are you doing ?
Get out of here .
Go on .
A little more to the right .
That &apos;s better .
See that the drape is well-hung .
The mistress will inspect it later .
Hello , Hives .
- Mrs. Whitehead !
This is a surprise .
- And how about me ?
- Miss Grace !
You &apos;ve grown so .
- You haven &apos;t lost any weight , either .
No , unfortunately not .
It seems strange to find you working here instead of our own home .
After you left for Europe , Mrs. Rittenhouse made me an offer .
Lovely .
By the way , what &apos;s the secret about the painting ?
No secret .
It &apos;s Beaugard &apos;s &quot; After the Hunt &quot; .
The original ?
- Most original .
Be careful .
Where did she get that ?
Is it very valuable ?
- It must be worth a fortune .
It looks as if Mrs. Rittenhouse gets the Social Award of the Season .
Can &apos;t we do something ?
- We might shoot ourselves .
I &apos;d rather shoot Mrs. Rittenhouse .
I have an idea .
I copied that painting at art school a year ago .
Well , what of it ?
But I still don &apos;t get it .
We &apos;ll substitute it for the original and when she unveils it , she &apos;ll have a cruel imitation .
Grace , you &apos;re wonderful .
- That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been telling you .
I won &apos;t be long . - Alright .
See you later .
Oh , Hives ?
Do you still feel a bond between us ?
- Most certainly , Mrs. Whitehead .
Strong enough for you to do me a big favor ? - Anything at all .
If I were to ask you to take away the Beaugard ...
Do you mean ...
- Temporarily , of course .
And substitute something of my own ?
- Quite an unusual request .
It is , but somehow I still think of you as one of the Whiteheads .
You may count on me .
My soul is yours , even though my body may belong to Mrs. Rittenhouse .
Why , Hives !
Oh , Mrs. Whitehead !
- Arabella !
May I present Mr. Parker ?
- Of the Massachusetts &apos; Parkers ?
Why , no .
- Then the Southern Parkers ?
No , the Central Parkers .
You know , the Benches and Trees .
I see .
Meow !
Oh , I don &apos;t like that woman .
You sit down here and tell me whom you do like .
Oh , so that &apos;s your game .
- Now listen .
Do you really love me ?
Marry me and find out .
- Marry you ?
On what ?
Last year I sold 2 paintings .
One at 100 and one at 50 .
Could we live on $ 150 a year ?
- We wouldn &apos;t need money .
I &apos;ve got a charge account in every shop on 5th Avenue .
If I had any brains , I &apos;d give up painting and get a regular job .
I had a cousin who made $ 50,000 in Wall Street last year .
I don &apos;t wanna marry your cousin .
I &apos;m a darn fool and wanna marry you .
Say ... we could get that old bluff Chandler to buy a portrait from you .
Chandler ?
What does he know about art ?
The less he knows , the easier it &apos;ll be for you .
They &apos;re right upstairs .
You can &apos;t miss them .
Go round the other side .
Mrs. Rittenhouse .
Captain Spaulding !
How are you ?
Tell me .
Are you alone ?
- Captain , I don &apos;t understand .
You don &apos;t ?
Don &apos;t give me that innocent stuff or you &apos;ll be alone .
A big cluck like you turning cute on me !
Mrs. Rittenhouse ...
- Yes ?
Oh , pardon me .
You &apos;ve been affected like this before ?
Oh no , Captain .
- You will be .
Mrs. Rittenhouse ...
Ever since I &apos;ve met you , I &apos;ve swept you off my feet .
Something has been beating in me like the incessant tom-tom in the jungle .
Something that I must ask you .
- What is it , Captain ?
Would you wash a pair of socks for me ?
- I &apos;m surprised .
It &apos;s been on my mind for weeks .
It &apos;s my way of saying I love you .
I love you .
I &apos;ve never been ...
- Captain !
Pardon me . Am I intruding ?
Are you intruding ?
Just when I had her on the 5-yard line .
I should say you were intruding .
Pardon , that you are intruding .
I was using the subjunctive instead of the past tense .
Yes , we &apos;re way past tents , we &apos;re living in bungalows now .
Mrs. Whitehead , you haven &apos;t met Captain Spaulding , have you ?
No .
How are you ?
- How are you ?
- Fine , thank you .
How are you ?
And how are you ?
That leaves you one up .
Did anyone ever tell you you had beautiful eyes ?
- No .
Well , you have .
And so have you .
He shot her a glance .
As a smile played around his lips .
I &apos;ve never seen four more beautiful eyes in my life .
Well , three anyway .
You two girls have everything .
You &apos;re tall and short , slim and stout .
Just the kind of girl I crave .
We three would make an ideal couple .
You have beauty , charm , money .
You have got money ?
If not , we can quit right now .
The Captain is charming , isn &apos;t he ?
- I &apos;m fascinated .
I &apos;m fascinated , too .
Right on the arm .
Fascinated , whim-wham !
If I were Eugene O &apos;Neill , I could tell you what I really think of you two .
You &apos;re fortunate the Theater Gill isn &apos;t putting this on .
And so is The Gill .
Pardon me while I have a strange interlude .
You couple of baboons , what makes you think I &apos;d marry either one of you ?
Strange how the wind blows tonight .
It reminds me of poor old Marsden .
How happy I could be with either of these two , if both of them just went away .
Well , girls , will you marry me ?
Which one of us ?
- Both of you .
Let &apos;s all get married .
It &apos;s my party .
Party ...
Party ...
Here I am talking of parties .
I came down for a party . What happens ?
Nothing .
Not even ice cream .
The gods look down and laugh .
The world would be better for children if the parents had to eat the spinach .
What do you say ?
We all gonna get married ?
- All of us ?
- All of us .
That &apos;s bigamy .
- Yes , and that &apos;s big of me , too .
Let &apos;s be big for a change .
One woman and one man was enough for your grandmother , but who wants to marry her ? Nobody .
Not even your grandfather .
Think of the honeymoon .
Strictly private .
No other woman allowed .
Well , maybe one or two , but no men .
I may not go myself .
You want a companionate marriage ?
It has its advantages .
You &apos;d live with your folks , I &apos;d live with your folks .
And you &apos;d sell Fuller brushes .
Living with your folks ...
The beginning of the end .
Drab yesterdays shutting out beautiful tomorrows .
Hideous footsteps creaking along the misty corridors of time , and in those corridors I see figures .
Strange figures .
Weird figures :
Steel 186 , Anaconda 74 ,
American Can 138 .
Where were we ?
Oh yes , we wanted to marry .
What do you think ?
Should we ?
- Marriage is a noble institution .
The foundation of the American home .
- Yes , but it can &apos;t be enforced .
It was put over on us while our boys were over there and our girls over here .
I &apos;ve waited at these stairs for years for just this moment .
Captain , where are you going ?
- I &apos;m sorry , ladies , we &apos;ll have to postpone the wedding for a few days .
Maybe for a few years .
Before I get married , I &apos;m gonna sow a couple of wild oats .
The Captain &apos;s so amusing .
- Isn &apos;t he charming ?
That &apos;s the famous Beaugard , eh ?
Great picture , isn &apos;t it ?
You &apos;ve seen it before ?
- I spent 3 days in Paris copying it .
You did ?
- Me and a million other artists .
I bet yours was better than the rest .
- It wasn &apos;t bad .
I &apos;ll show it to you sometime .
Listen .
- What ?
- Mother &apos;s going to unveil it tonight .
Yeah ?
Suppose when she unveils it , it &apos;s not the Beaugard at all .
Suppose it &apos;s yours .
- You want to swap mine for his ?
Exactly .
- You &apos;re crazy .
What good would it do ?
What good ?
Listen .
They &apos;ll unveil it . Chandler will tell everyone how fine it is . They &apos;ll cheer like mad , and then we &apos;ll tell them who really did it .
They &apos;ll say you &apos;re a great artist . You &apos;ll get 6 commissions , and we can be married and divorced in no time .
Sound great .
But what if they don &apos;t like my painting ?
Isn &apos;t the chance worth taking ?
I see you &apos;re admiring my picture ?
- Yes , yes .
Your picture ?
- Yes , my picture .
- It don &apos;t look like you .
Some place I met you before .
Your face is very familiar .
I am one of the most well-known men in America .
The newpapers keep running my photograph .
You &apos;re not Abe Kabibble ?
- Nonsense .
If you &apos;re not Abe Kabibble , who are you ?
Now please .
My name is Roscoe W. Chandler .
I don &apos;t get about the name . Some place I met you before .
Were you ever in Sing Sing ?
- Please .
No .
I got it .
Joliet !
- Let me alone .
Alright . Don &apos;t run away .
Leavenworth !
I &apos;ve never been in these places .
I &apos;ve spent most of my time in Europe .
I &apos;ve got it now .
You come from Czechoslovakia .
You &apos;re wrong .
I &apos;ve never been there .
Hey , come here .
- I tell you .
Get away from me .
You remember him ?
He come from Czechoslovakia .
You are wrong . I told you before .
He come from Czechoslovakia . And I know who it is .
Abie , the fish peddler from Czechoslovakia .
- Ridiculous .
We prove it .
He had a birthmark .
Please , what are you trying ?
Let me alone !
There it is !
The birthmark !
Abie , the fishman .
I confess . I was Abie .
How did you get to be Chandler ?
- How did you get to be Italian ?
Whose confession is this ?
Don &apos;t tell anyone about this and we can come to some agreement . One that is mutually satisfactory .
Money .
Money .
- Shall we say $ 500 ?
Fie to $ 500 !
- All the cash I have with me .
$ 500 ?
I tell you what . We &apos;ll take your IOU .
That &apos;s my best offer .
- That &apos;s all you &apos;ll give ?
Abie the fishman !
Abie the fishman !
Please , be quiet .
Come here .
I have a check for $ 5,000 .
Is it good ?
- Of course .
Who would give me a bad check ?
I would .
See if it &apos;s good .
Alright , if you don &apos;t want it ...
- That &apos;s all we get ?
Yes .
- He &apos;s Abie the fishman !
Give me that handkerchief .
My tie !
Where &apos;s my tie ?
Nothing but a pair of thieves .
I get the tie . What you got ?
The birthmark !
Where &apos;s your tie ?
- Why I ...
Fine way for a millionaire to run around .
Have you got garters ?
- Of course .
Oh , they &apos;ve taken them .
A likely story .
Have you at least got socks ?
Certainly .
Here .
- They look pretty old to me .
Whose are they ?
Well , old socks .
Let me introduce myself .
I &apos;m Captain Spaulding .
Roscoe W. Chandler .
- This is a treat , your treat .
You have heard about me ?
I &apos;ve heard about you for years , and I &apos;m getting pretty sick of it .
Quite naturally , I &apos;ve also heard of the great Captain Spaulding .
Fine . I &apos;ve heard of you and you &apos;ve heard of me .
Have you heard the one about the two Irishmen ?
- Oh yes .
Then let &apos;s get down to business .
My name is Spaulding .
Roscoe W. Chandler .
- Geoffrey T. Spaulding .
What &apos;s the &quot; T &quot; stand for ?
Thomas ?
- Edgar .
You were close , though .
I want to talk to you about something .
Would you like to finance an expedition ?
- That is a question .
You certainly know a question when you see it .
I congratulate you .
And that brings us back to where we were .
Will you finance an expedition ?
Do you have a particular one in mind ?
I &apos;ve always wanted to do something before I quit . - What is that ?
Retire .
Now , would you be interested ?
My retirement would be the greatest contribution to science ever .
This is your chance . When I think what you have done for this country .
What have you done , by the way ?
- Oh well ...
I &apos;ve always tried to do what I could .
Especially for art .
How have we drifted around to that ?
What is your opinion of art ?
I &apos;m glad you asked .
- I withdraw the question .
He takes things seriously . You can &apos;t ask a simple question .
Where will you build your new opera house ?
- Near Central Park .
Why not right in Central Park ?
- Could we ?
At night , when no one &apos;s looking .
Better yet , in the reservoir .
But that could interfere with the water supply .
After all , art is art .
On the other hand , water is water .
And east is east , west is west .
If you stew cranberries like applesauce , they tastes like prunes .
Now tell me what you know .
I would gladly giving you my opinion .
Dandy , I &apos;ll ask you for them someday .
Can you be in my office at 10 tomorrow ?
Ask for my secretary .
If he sees you , I &apos;ll discharge him .
Saturday at 3 . No , make that Tuesday .
I &apos;m going to Europe Monday .
My name is Spaulding . I &apos;ve always wanted to meet you .
What do you think of the problems of traffic and marriage ?
What do you think of when you go to bed , you beast ?
Well , I ...
- I &apos;d rather not hear it .
There are children present .
My dear Captain , it boils down to a question of money .
The nickel is not what it was 10 years ago .
I &apos;ll go further than that .
It &apos;s not what it was 15 years ago .
You know what this country needs ?
A 7-cent nickel .
We &apos;ve had the 5-cent nickel since 1492 .
Nearly 100 years .
Let &apos;s give the 7-cent nickel a chance , and then try an 8-cent nickel .
You buy a 3-cent paper and get the same nickel back .
One nickel carefully used would last a family a lifetime .
I think that &apos;s a wonderful idea .
- Really ?
- Yes .
Then there can &apos;t be much to it .
Forget it .
Tell me , Captain Chandler ...
Excuse me , Spaulding .
I &apos;m Spaulding . You &apos;re Chandler .
Let &apos;s have no more of this .
Alright .
- Bad enough being Spaulding .
- Tell me , Captain Spaulding ...
Spaulding is the right name ?
- Right .
I &apos;m Chand ...
No , I &apos;m Spauld ...
Show me the program .
For all he knows , I might be coming next week .
Captain Spaulding , you &apos;re quite a traveler .
How about South America ?
I &apos;m going there soon .
Where exactly ?
- Uruguay .
You go your-a-way , I &apos;ll go mine .
Let &apos;s change the subject .
Take the foreign situation .
Take Abyssinia . And I &apos;ll take a hot butterscotch sundae on rye .
Let &apos;s see what the boys in the back room are up to .
Let &apos;s see how yours compares with the original .
- Alright .
No difference !
- Look closer . Maybe you &apos;ll find it &apos;s better .
You seen my partner ?
- No .
Oh , Mr. Raviola !
Ravelli .
Ravelli .
- Oh , Mr. Ravelli .
Would you do something for me ?
I &apos;d do anything for you .
What do ya want ?
You see that painting ?
- You mean this piksh ?
Take it out of the frame and put this one in its place .
You want I should take this one down and put this one upstairs ?
- Yes .
You want I should steal ?
- No . It &apos;s not stealing .
Then I couldn &apos;t do it .
- Oh , Mr. Raviola !
Hey , get up . Come here .
That &apos;s all you do .
Chase the women .
Oh , stop .
Everybody plays cards , but they don &apos;t ask us .
We just wasting our time .
We &apos;ve been here all day .
How much we make ? Nothing .
Soon we go to the old ladies &apos; home .
How do you like that ?
No , that &apos;s no good .
These people here got money .
We gotta find someone to play with us .
I &apos;d play anything .
Poker , pinochle ...
- Signor Ravelli , I want to talk to you about the music .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
It would be nice ...
Go away from me !
What is this ?
Hello , Professor .
What &apos;s the matter with his feet ?
We play all kinds of games .
Blackjack , soccer ...
One , two , three ...
Why don &apos;t you leave him alone ?
Now that this game is over , how about some bridge ?
You play bridge ?
- A little .
- What do you play for ?
Just for small stakes .
- And french-fried potatoes ?
Set it up right over there , Hives .
- Very good , madam .
What is he up to ?
Look at this .
Take it away , Hives .
- Extraordinary .
How do you want to play ?
Honest ?
- I hope so .
You put that right away .
It &apos;s your own fault .
We &apos;ll cut for partners .
- No , I only play if he &apos;s my partner .
It &apos;s against the rules .
We have to cut for partners .
Alright , we cut for partners .
I got ace of spades .
He &apos;s got ace of spades .
Coincidences !
Two aces of spades ?
- Yeah , he &apos;s got thousands of them .
He has the choice of seat then .
- You have the choice of seat .
Not on her lap .
- Sit down .
What &apos;s the matter with him ?
- He thought it was contact bridge .
Just a moment .
Shuffle the cards .
- You gotta scrumble them up .
Just a moment . I &apos;d like to cut them .
That &apos;s a winner .
Your bid , partner .
You pass ?
Misdeal .
You pass ?
I bid one spade .
I pass .
- Three spades .
Four spades .
One club .
- I don &apos;t understand this bidding .
You don &apos;t have to .
You bid four spades , eh ?
I haven &apos;t a spade in my hand .
- Alright . We double .
Something &apos;s wrong here .
Let &apos;s do over the bidding .
Oh , she want to bid again .
He bids one .
One ?
One what ?
- That &apos;s alright . You &apos;ll find out .
But we have to know what he &apos;s bidding .
- Later .
Now I bid two .
Two what ?
- Two of the same he bids .
Now the bidding &apos;s over . That &apos;s enough .
It &apos;s your lead .
You can &apos;t lead that .
- Why not ?
We can &apos;t take it .
- What should I lead ?
He &apos;ll show you . Ace of spades .
That &apos;s -a very good .
Three of spades . Four of spades .
You trump it ?
You call that finesse .
No spades , partner .
No spades .
Ace of hearts .
Ace of clubs .
Dummy leads .
The dummy leads .
I &apos;m not the dummy .
- Well , you could be .
Ace of diamonds .
Hundred aces , eh ?
Two hundred ?
That &apos;s better .
Ace of hearts .
Atta boy . Make a big slam .
Make a big , big slam .
Ace of spades .
Ace of spades .
That &apos;s a good guy .
Plays a good game .
Ace of spades .
Plays a fine game .
Ace of spades .

You &apos;re nothing but two cardsharps .
- My shoes are gone .
Graciousness .
He has your slippers .
Come along .
Hey , you take-a the ladies &apos; shoes ?
Quiet !
Hide .
Somebody &apos;s coming .
Alright , I make a mistake .
Get up , come on .
Come on .
Hurry up .
You know what we do ?
We hang that picture upstairs , for the lady .
Don &apos;t touch .
You got everything ready ?
Shovel , axe , dynamite , pineapples ?
Where &apos;s the flash ?
Flash , flash .
That &apos;s no the flash .
That &apos;s a fish !
I don &apos;t want the fish . Flash !
Stop it . You crazy .
When you go out at night , you gotta have the flash .
That &apos;s no flash . That &apos;s a flisk .
Flash .
When you wanna see somebody , you gotta have the flash .
That &apos;s a flush .
What I gonna do with the flush ?
That &apos;s a flitz .
What I gonna do with flitz ?
What do ya got ?
That &apos;s a flutz .
All you got is a fish and a flutz and a flitz and a flutz ...
Stop this .
Where &apos;s the flash ?
Look , when everything &apos;s light and you wanna make &apos; em dark .
Hey , you crazy . I want no blackjack .
My mistake .
When everything &apos;s dark and you wanna make &apos; em light .
Yeah , that &apos;s a flash .
That &apos;s a flash .
Hey , that &apos;s good , alright .
The storm put the lights out .
Nobody can see what we do .
Where &apos;s the flash ?
Where &apos;s the flash ?
I no want the fish . Flash .
No , no flutz .
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
Flash .
Before the people are coming .
What &apos;s a matter ?
You lose it ?
You gotta find it .
Look for it .
Alright , never mind . We &apos;ll work without it .
Hide ! Hide !
Somebody &apos;s coming .
Quiet , quiet .
Shut up .
Keep quiet .
I know where you are .
It &apos;s alright .
Oh , Captain Spaulding , where are you ?
- Yeah ?
Oh , Captain ...
- What &apos;s the trouble ?
The lights have gone out .
You can &apos;t see your hand before your face .
It wouldn &apos;t be very pleasant , anyway .
Well , I &apos;m going to take a nap .
Leave me a call for three o &apos;clock .
Make it three-thirty .
The service here is excellent .
Pardon me , did you lose a fish ?
- What ?
Somebody lost it .
Will you have it fried for me ?
Did you hear that ?
Somebody &apos;s over there .
I say somebody &apos;s over there .
- Nonsense .
The house is settling .
Anybody over there ?
- I don &apos;t see anybody .
There you are . If anybody was there , he &apos;d see him , wouldn &apos;t I ?
What is it , Captain ?
What is it ?
You know what I think ?
I think you got roaches .
You got roaches alright .
And the biggest one has asthma .
Horrible !
Come on , Captain .
This can &apos;t be the library .
This must be the operating room .
We get the picture and we don &apos;t make a sound .
Somebody turned on the lights .
Alright , we get the picture and don &apos;t make one sound .
What do you want ?
Oh , the fish .
Go on .
That &apos;s some storm , eh ?
A regular tornado .
Let &apos;s go this way . I think it &apos;s a shortcut .
Come on , let &apos;s go .
California .
Before we start the musical program , Captain Spaulding will tell us about his trip to Africa .
Captain Spaulding .
- Me ?
Friends , I &apos;m going to tell you of that great , mysterious , wonderful Africa .
Africa is God &apos;s country , and he can have it .
We left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 2 .
After 15 days on the water and 6 on the boat , we reached Africa .
We proceeded 300 miles inland , where I shot a polar bear .
This bear was 6 &apos; 7 &quot; in its stockinged feet , with shoes on .
- Just a moment .
I always thought polar bears lived in the frozen north .
You did ?
This one was anemic and couldn &apos;t stand the cold .
He was a rich bear and could afford the trip .
You take care of your animals , and I &apos;ll take care of mine .
Frozen north , my eye !
From our arrival , we led an active life .
The first morning saw us up at 6 , breakfasted and back in bed at 7 .
This went on for 3 months .
We got so we were able to be in bed by 6 : 30 .
One morning I was smoking some meat ...
Smoking some meat ?
- Yes , there was no cigar store .
I was sitting in front of the cabin , when I bagged 6 tigers .
Captain . Did you catch 6 tigers ?
I begged them to go away , but they hung around all day .
They were the most persistent tigers I &apos;ve ever seen .
The principal animals in Africa are moose , elks and Knights of Pythias .
You all know what a moose is .
The first day I shot two bucks .
As I say , you all know what a moose is .
A moose eats cheese and is chased by cats .
The elks live in the hills , and hold their convention in the spring .
It &apos;s interesting when they come to the waterhole .
Boy , do they run when they see it &apos;s only a waterhole .
What they &apos;re looking for is an alco-hole .
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas .
How he got in them , I don &apos;t know .
We tried to remove the tusks .
That &apos;s not so easy to say , tusks .
Oh , simple .
Tusks .
My name is Spaulding .
I &apos;ve always wanted to meet you .
As I say , we tried to remove the tusks , but we couldn &apos;t budge them .
In Alabama , the tusks are looser . But that &apos;s entirely ir-elephant .
We took pictures of the native girls , but they weren &apos;t developed .
But we &apos;re going back in a couple of weeks ...
Very enlightening .
- Hooray for Captain Spaulding .
Three cheers !
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding !
Three cheers ...
- No one asked for the chairs .
Put them back . Now get along .
Go on , go on !
And now , friends , Signor Ravelli will oblige us at the piano .
His first selection is &quot; Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping &quot; with a male chorus .
Say , if you get near a song , play it .
I can &apos;t think of the finish .
That &apos;s strange .
I can &apos;t think of anything else .
You know what ? I think I went past it .
If you come around again , jump off .
I once kept this up for three days .
You wouldn &apos;t consider hush money , would you ?
I can &apos;t get &apos; em now .
I &apos;ve gotta wait for inspiration .
- It &apos;s about time .
Play the song about Montreal .
- Montreal ?
&quot; I &apos;m A Dreamer , Montreal . &quot;
Don &apos;t know it .
I &apos;ll play one of my own compositions , by Victor Herbert .
Make it short .
He plays them both well .
Your team scored that time .
And the old blue one .
Why do you push ?
- They may exterminate each other .
The best thing for either of them .
That one &apos;s for old Purdue .
I was afraid of that .
I thought I had the finish . - I wish you did .
Yours .
Play the song about the Irish chiropodist .
&quot; My Fate Is In Your Hands &quot; .
Is there a horse in the house ?
They got everything else here .
And now , Mrs. Rittenrotten ...
Rittenhouse .
- Yes , a slight error .
I have a surprise for you .
The man is here for the piano .
- Oh , Captain !
When I departed from the natives in Africa , they gave me a gift .
And this I give to you , at a low fare .
- How wonderful .
Don &apos;t be too hasty ...
- I can &apos;t wait ...
It was all done with the white of an egg .
What is it , Captain ?
What is it ?
It &apos;s a hope chest for a guinea pig .
This magnificent chest ...
No , this magnificent chest
I present to you with my compliments .
- This leaves me speechless .
See that you remain that way .
- And now , ladies and gentlemen ...
Step outside and say that .
Mrs. Rittenhouse has perhaps a greater surprise for us in the library .
This way , Captain .
Mrs. Rittenhouse , how do you pay Hives ?
By the week or by the pound ?
And now it is my privilege to reveal the masterpiece of François Jacques DuBois Gilbert Beaugard .
No trains will be sold after the magazines leave the depot .
&quot; After the Hunt . &quot;
There !
I said you were a great artist .
Shall we spill the beans ?
- Wait . Something might happen .
We &apos;d all enjoy a few words from Mr. Chandler , who will tell us something of Beaugard &apos;s life and work .
And keep it clean !
Mr. Chandler !
My friends , you are all familiar with Beaugard .
This is perhaps his masterpiece .
In it he has achieved a greatness in the handling of color and line .
Now you will see here ...
Wait !
This is not my picture .
This is a rank imitation .
What do you mean ?
- See for yourself .
You are right . It &apos;s not the Beaugard .
- Certainly not .
A dog is missing .
Captain Spaulding , what shall I do ?
- Call the dog-catchers at once .
They &apos;ve taken the original .
- I &apos;ll throw some light on this .
Anyone have a match ?
- What happened ?
Hives , where are you ?
Turn on the lights .
Did you lose that fish again ?
- I &apos;m so worried .
Good heavens . That one is gone , too .
- Oh , this is awful .
The crooks are escaping .
Follow me , men .
No , just the women !
Right this way .
They went out here .
Oh , the excitement .
I never saw anything so funny before .
This is great .
And there goes her old party .
Wasn &apos;t it funny ?
- Oh , v-v-v-very .
You &apos;re not afraid , are you ?
- Oh no . Not at all .
But they were talking about the police and I don &apos;t want them suspecting me .
They won &apos;t suspect you .
- Oh yes !
The last time they suspected me , I got four years .
- Hives !
You give me the painting , and I &apos;ll take care of it .
- Good .
Good heavens . It &apos;s gone .
- Gone ?
- I left it in there .
There must be thieves at this party .
If I &apos;d known that , I never would have come .
That professor !
- The Professor !
I see !
That &apos;s the culprit .
We &apos;ve got to get that picture away from him .
Might I suggest this ?
Very satisfactory in these cases .
A few drops on a handkerchief and the Professor is out .
You &apos;re sure it &apos;ll work ?
- Absolutely .
You want to try some ?
No thanks , Hives .
Let &apos;s find the Professor .
How did the thieves get away ?
And who was it ?
Lucky that we switched it .
Imagine them getting the original .
Oh ?
It would have been okay had they taken mine ?
I didn &apos;t mean that .
But what would Mother do ?
It &apos;s worth $ 100,000 .
How could she have replaced it ?
Oh , I understand .
Isn &apos;t it exciting ?
Just think , the thief was in the room with us .
Isn &apos;t it romantic ?
All the boys I &apos;ve known used to say I was made of stone .
I would always leave them alone in despair .
I &apos;ve been on the pan , I &apos;ve been called an electric fan , told I &apos;m even much colder than Frigidaire .
I began to wonder if I was all wrong .
I thought so till you came along .
Tell me , dear , why am I so romantic ?
When you &apos;re near , why am I so romantic ?
What a grand feeling , when your lips meet mine . That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine .
I don &apos;t know what it is you &apos;ve done to me .
You don &apos;t know half of the good you do me .
Other boys bore me , they just leave me blue .
Oh , why am I so romantic with you ?
Tell me , dear , why am I so romantic ?
When you &apos;re near , why am I so romantic ?
What a grand feeling , when your lips touch mine . That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine .
When we touch , close in your arms you hold me . I forget all that my mother told me .
Other girls bore me , they just leave me blue .
But why am I so romantic with you ?
Oh , Signor Ravelli !
I &apos;ve been looking for you all morning .
I was busy all morning .
- You &apos;ve got to return that painting .
Painting ? What painting ?
The painting you changed last night .
You mean the piksh ?
- Yes .
First you want it upstairs , then downstairs .
Make up your mind .
I do thank you . But you &apos;ve got to return it before the police come .
The police are coming ?
- Yes . - I give it you . You put it back .
Where &apos;s the piksh ?
- What do you mean ?
I put &apos; em in here .
It &apos;s gone . You take &apos; em ?
- Me ?
No , I know .
Abie the fish peddler .
Did Mother invite a fish peddler here ?
I don &apos;t know , but he &apos;s here .
Come on , we find him .
Good morning .
- Good morning , Mr. Jamison .
How is Captain Spaulding ?
He didn &apos;t sleep a wink .
He went horseback riding last night .
I &apos;m sorry .
We &apos;ve all been pretty upset .
Good morning , Captain .
Did you enjoy your ride ?
What are you looking for ?
- I lost my horse .
He slipped out from between me .
I had my feet in the stirrups , too .
Never mind .
But I lost the bit you loaned me .
I &apos;ll get you another bit .
- Then I owe you two bits .
I hope you weren &apos;t distressed by last night &apos;s sad occurrence .
You mean dinner ?
- No , the stolen painting !
A painting was stolen ?
I haven &apos;t seen one in three weeks .
Why didn &apos;t you inform me ?
What do I engage you for ?
I didn &apos;t know it .
- You should have asked me .
I &apos;m sorry .
- You &apos;re sorry ?
You &apos;re a contemptible cur !
I repeat .
You &apos;re a contemptible cur .
If I were a man , you &apos;d resent that .
Please keep quiet !
I can get along without you .
I got along without your father .
And your uncle .
And your uncle . And my uncle .
I didn &apos;t come to be exonerated .
- I beg your pardon .
You do , eh ?
I &apos;d like to see you crawl out of a rumble seat .
The police are here .
- Have them come in .
Oh , so that &apos;s your game .
You can &apos;t shut me up !
You can talk to my attorney .
Jamison , take a letter to my lawyers .
I &apos;ll show you a thing or two .
Or three .
I &apos;ll show you a thing or three .
Sending for the police !
Take a letter to my lawyers .
Sending for the police !
Take a letter to my lawyers .
- I am .
Read me what you have so far .
Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga , c / o Hungadunga , Hungadunga , Hungadunga , Hungadunga McCormack .
Semicolon .
How do you spell &quot; semicolon &quot; ?
- Alright , make it a comma .
Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga , Hungadunga ...
McCormack .
Gentlemen , question mark . Er-r-r !
Do you want &quot; er-r-r &quot; in the letter ?
- No , put that in an envelope .
Now then ...
In re yours of the 5 inst , yours to hand and beg to rep , brackets , that we have gone over the ground carefully and we seem to believe , i.e. , to wit , e.g. , in lieu ,
that despite all our precautionary measures , we seem to believe it is hardly necessary for us to proceed unless we receive an ipso facto that is not negligible at this moment .
Quotes , unquotes and quotes .
Hoping this finds you ...
- Finds him where ?
Let him worry about that .
Don &apos;t be so inquisitive .
Sneak !
Hoping this finds you , I beg to remain ...
I &apos;ll show you where I get off .
Sending for the police .
Now read me the letter .
&quot; Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga . &quot;
That &apos;s it .
&quot; C / o Hungadunga , Hungadunga , Hungadunga McCormack . &quot;
You &apos;ve left out a Hungadunga .
You left out the main one , too .
Thought you could slip one over on me , didn &apos;t you ?
Alright , leave it out .
Put in a windshield wiper instead .
I tell you what .
Make it three windshield wipers and one Hungadunga .
They won &apos;t all be there when the letter arrives .
&quot; ... and McCormack .
Gentlemen , question mark . &quot;
Put it on the penultimate and not on the dipthonic .
You should brush up on your Greek .
Get a Greek and brush up on him .
&quot; In re yours of the 5 inst . &quot; - I see .
A lot of things you said weren &apos;t important , so I just omitted them .
Oh Captain !
Good gracious .
Omitted them , eh ?
You just omitted the body of the letter , that &apos;s all .
Just left out the body of the letter .
Yours is not to reason why .
You &apos;ve left out the body .
Alright , send it that way and tell him the body will follow .
The body in brackets ?
No , it &apos;ll never get there in brackets .
Put it in a box .
Put it in a box and mark it &apos; fragilly&apos;
Mark it what ? - &apos; Fragilly !
&apos; F-R-A-G ...
Look it up in the dictionary , under fragile .
Look under the table if you don &apos;t find it there .
&quot; Quotes , unquotes and quotes . &quot; - 3 quotes ?
- Yes , sir .
Add another and make it a gallon .
Regards .
- That &apos;s a fine letter , Jamison .
That &apos;s an epic . Make two carbon copies and throw the original away .
Then throw the copies away .
Just send a stamp . Air mail .
Mrs. Rittenhouse ?
I &apos;m Inspector Hennessey .
- How do you do ?
I &apos;m Captain Scotland of Spaulding Yard .
No .
Spaulding , Scotland Yard .
Don &apos;t make the same mistake again .
- I &apos;m glad to know you .
Between us we can solve this crime .
Especially if you go home .
No hasty arrests , please !
I don &apos;t want my guests embarrassed .
We won &apos;t arrest anybody .
- He &apos;s lucky to not go jail himself .
Would you take the Inspector and his men to the scene of the crime .
Certainly .
This way .
Come on , boys .
Jamison , count the spoons .
I didn &apos;t know you &apos;d been a detective .
- There &apos;s a lot you don &apos;t know .
I suppose so . - Darn right !
Where were you on June 5 , 1774 ?
I don &apos;t know .
- Where was I ?
I don &apos;t know .
- Me neither .
If I did , I wouldn &apos;t tell you .
Take a number from 1 to 10 . - Alright .
Which one ? - 7 .
- That &apos;s right . 7 is right .
I could solve this in 5 minutes if I wanted to worry .
I don &apos;t want you to worry .
Nothing should interfere with your weekend .
Nothing interferes with my weak end .
And don &apos;t be so personal !
Where &apos;s my secretary ?
Jamison !
- I didn &apos;t want to offend you .
Dastardly cracker !
I wish I was in the jungle where men are monkeys .
Captain , I &apos;m so sorry .
- Jamison !
No , no .
Good morning , Mrs. Rittenhouse !
- Good morning .
Charming party .
I wouldn &apos;t have missed it for the world .
It &apos;s just full of surprises .
- Glad you &apos;re enjoying yourself .
Hives !
Good morning .
Some breakfast ?
- Nothing doing .
Where &apos;s the painting ?
I watched all night , but the Professor did not sleep in his room .
Very strange .
- Good heavens . What will we do ?
I don &apos;t know .
Until we see the Professor ...
You keep an eye on him till I get back with the bottle .
Don &apos;t worry , he &apos;ll not get away from me this time .
Did you get it ? - Yes .
- I &apos;ll engage him in conversation .
You trail behind and knock him out when the time comes .
Very good , madam .
Hello . I &apos;ve been looking all over for you !
Where were you ?
What &apos;s the matter with this ?
Are they the morning papers ?
No , that isn &apos;t the one I want .
Show me the others .
That still isn &apos;t the one .
Out !
Yes , out !
The birds ...
Come on , sit down . I want to talk .
Don &apos;t you like me ?
You don &apos;t ?
Well , I like you .
I like little boys like you .
How old are you ?
Five years old ?
You &apos;re just a baby .
Oh , isn &apos;t that nice ?
I like that .
No , no , no .
All joking aside , isn &apos;t there someone you do like ?
Isn &apos;t there someone you love ?
Think again .
Isn &apos;t there someone you really and truly love ?
Is there ?
Tell me who !
Why , that &apos;s a horse !
You love a horse ?
Come on , lift him up .
Come on . He &apos;s out .
- Let &apos;s go .
Arabella !
- I &apos;ve been trying to find you .
Ravelli has lost the painting .
I just found one on the terrace .
The Beaugard ?
- No .
- Oh , yours ?
If it &apos;s not yours , and not the Beaugard , whose is it ?
Someone switched it for mine , thinking they got the original .
Somebody swiped my scheme , eh ?
Then Chandler never saw your painting ?
- No .
You may still be a great artist .
Where is this picture ?
Up in my room .
- You get it and I &apos;ll get the Captain .
He &apos;ll get to the bottom of this .
Then John found the third painting .
- Very interesting .
Well , sort of .
We have to keep our eyes open .
- If I don &apos;t find it , Mother &apos;s out $ 100,000 .
Give me 24 hours for the case .
Then we &apos;ll call in someone else .
Wait till tomorrow .
Remember the Charlie Ross case ? I was on that , and he was never found .
Captain Yard of Scotland Spaulding always gets his women , or paintings .
Do you know what &apos;s happened with the painting I found ?
It &apos;s been stolen from my room .
You see !
I &apos;ve been on the case five minutes and another one is gone .
I bet it &apos;s not even three minutes .
My watch is gone .
This is too much .
It wasn &apos;t going , and now it &apos;s gone .
And my room was locked .
- Who could it have been ?
Wait . I think I &apos;ve got a clue .
No , it &apos;s a red hair .
The Professor ?
No , it couldn &apos;t be .
He &apos;s Crook of the Month this month .
Anyhow , we &apos;ll investigate it .
You know Conductor Hennessey ?
- Inspector !
Inspect her yourself . You know that redheaded fellow ?
- Yes .
Well , get those flagpole sitters of yours to find him .
Come on , boys .
We &apos;ll soon get to the bottom of this .
Hey , what &apos;s that cop doing there ?
It didn &apos;t take that long to find him .
- This is it !
Yes , but which one is it ?
- The one just taken from my room .
Maybe my watch is back , too .
Now the fob is gone !
Well , I still got the pocket .
Anything I retain now is velvet .
Except the coat . That &apos;s Prince Albert .
Well , all the jokes can &apos;t be good .
If we find the fella who painted this , it &apos;d be a pretty good clue .
- What ?
If we find the fella who painted this , it &apos;d be a pretty good clue .
You just said that .
How dull you turned out to be !
Let me see that a minute .
It &apos;s signed &quot; Beaugard &quot; .
There &apos;s the criminal .
No . Beaugard is dead .
Dead ?
Then it &apos;s murder !
Now we &apos;ve got something .
What do you got ?
- Jacks and aces .
And you ?
Good .
I was bluffing .
- Does something strike you funny about this picture ?
It isn &apos;t as funny as all that .
Did you ever see a tree like that ?
Tree ?
That &apos;s a spinach .
- It can &apos;t be .
Where &apos;s the egg ?
It could be spinach .
Look at all the sand .
You mean it &apos;s an old Spinach custom ?
No , it &apos;s not that .
No . That &apos;s my mistake .
You know what it is ?
Coleslaw .
Coleslaw ?
- Yeah .
Did you ever see a coleslaw like that ?
- Sure , look at this .
I don &apos;t want any of your lip now .
Did you ever see anything like that ?
You know what this is ?
A left-handed painting .
There &apos;s a signature .
- That &apos;s right .
This is either a left-handed painting or a vegetable dinner .
If we can find the left-handed person , we &apos;ll have &quot; The Trial of Mary Dugan &quot; .
I saw that . Goodbye .
- Wait .
I &apos;m going to need you .
We mustn &apos;t lose this evidence .
Take it to your room and leave the door open this time .
And not a word about this to anybody . Not even to me .
Ravelli , we &apos;ve got to find the left-handed painting .
The first thing to do is to find the motive .
What was the motive of the Beaugard crooks ?
I got it .
Robbery !
Would you mind crossing the street when it &apos;s red ?
Si , Capt &apos; Sit down .
I know how we find this painting .
In such a mysterious case , you gotta get the clues .
You gotta use the Sherlock Holmes method .
It goes like this :
You say , &quot; What happened ? &quot; The answer : &quot; Something was stolen . &quot;
You say , &quot; What was stolen ? &quot; The answer come back : &quot; A painting . &quot;
Are you a ventriloquist ?
Now you say , &quot; Where was this painting stolen ? &quot; The answer : &quot; In this house . &quot;
Now , so far I &apos;m right ?
It &apos;s pretty hard to be wrong if you keep answering yourself .
You go a little further and say , &quot; Who stole the painting ? &quot;
A very important question .
When you answer it , you got the whole solution .
Especially if you find the picture .
Now put all the clues together and what do ya got ?
- Bread pudding .
No .
Something was stolen .
Where ?
In this house .
By who ? Somebody here .
Now all you gotta do is ask everyone in the house if they took it .
I could rent you out as a decoy for duck hunters .
You &apos;re going to ask everyone here if they took the painting ?
And suppose no one here took it ?
- Go next door .
Great .
Suppose there is no house next door ?
Well , then we gotta build one .
Now you &apos;re talking .
What kind of house should we build ?
My idea of a house is something nice and small and comfortable .
Exactly , nothing elaborate .
A little place to call home and tell the wife I &apos;m not coming for dinner .
I see . You want a telephone booth .
No , in that case I &apos;d just call Chic Sale .
What do ya say we build right about here ?
Here ?
- Yeah , here .
- I &apos;d like it over here if possible .
I don &apos;t like junior crossing the rails on his way to reform school .
Actually I don &apos;t like junior at all .
Alright .
We got something over there , and believe me , that &apos;s convenient .
You just open the door , step outside , and there you are .
There you are ? Where ?
- Outside .
If you want to get back in again ?
- You had no right to go out .
Don &apos;t do anything until I hear from you , will you ?
Maybe the painting is in the cellar !
- That &apos;s no cellar , that &apos;s the roof .
Down there ?
- Yeah , so the chimney don &apos;t get wet when it rains .
I &apos;m off to get x-rayed .
I &apos;ll be back in a little while .
I think you &apos;re wrong , Ravelli .
- Don &apos;t get excited .
Here &apos;s the rooms .
This is your room . This is mine . And this is the maid &apos;s room .
I &apos;d have to go through your room ?
That &apos;s alright , I won &apos;t be in it .
You couldn &apos;t put the maid in your room ?
- Who says I couldn &apos;t ?
There &apos;s going to be a lot of traffic . I can see that .
Well , what do ya say ?
You ready to sign the lease ?
I &apos;d like to talk to my husband first .
Could you come back later ?
You married ?
- I &apos;ve got a girl as big as you are .
Alright . Get me one .
- Don &apos;t get vulgar , Ravelli .
How about the painting ?
We take care of that .
I &apos;ll tell you my idea .
The kitchen should be white .
Outside , green . Inside , cerise .
The painting , I say !
What you think I talk ?
Painting the kitchen white ...
The painting that was stolen !
- Stolen ?
Don &apos;t you remember ? Mrs. Rittenhouse lost a painting worth $ 100,000 .
No , I &apos;m a stranger here .
What do you think I am ?
One of the early settlers ?
Don &apos;t you remember Mrs. Beaugard lost a Rittenhouse oil painting ?
No , but I &apos;ve seen you someplace before .
Yeah , I was there .
But I &apos;ll stay away in the future .
Hey , Capt ! It come to me like a flash !
This painting wasn &apos;t stolen .
It has disappeared .
Yes , disappeared .
And you know what make it disappear ?
Moths !
Moths eat it !
Left-handed moths !
Go away .
I &apos;ll be alright in a minute .
Left-handed moths ate it ?
- That &apos;s my own solution .
I wish you were in it .
Left-handed moths !
I &apos;d buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn &apos;t open .
Hey , I got pair of shoes .
He &apos;s crazy .
Let &apos;s go and get the reward .
We solved it . You solved it .
It was eaten by left-handed moths .
- We did good work .
Are you tired ?
Lie down for a couple of years .
Lie down until rigor mortis sets in .
I know what we &apos;ll do .
Go to court to get a writ of habeas corpus .
To get rid of what ?
I never should have started that way .
I say , we &apos;ll go to court to get a writ of habeas corpus .
Yes , corpus .
- Didn &apos;t you ever see a habeas corpus ?
No , but I see &quot; Habeas Irish Rose &quot; .
Good morning . - Good morning .
Why don &apos;t you go to the beach with the others ?
You &apos;d feel better .
I &apos;d feel better with my Beaugard .
We &apos;re doing everything we can .
Mrs. Rittenhouse ! I have it !
- The Beaugard !
Wonderful !
My Beaugard !
Wait .
This is a rank imitation .
Where did you find it ?
In Mr. Parker &apos;s room , madam .
- Parker ?
One thing is certain .
Whoever did this also stole the Beaugard .
Hives , ask Mr. Parker to come here .
Wait .
My men will bring him in .
Get Mr. Parker .
What &apos;s wrong with this ?
- It &apos;s obvious that it &apos;s a rank imitation .
Mother , what &apos;s wrong ?
Something very strange has occurred and only you can explain it .
Gladly .
We found this in your room .
What have you done with the original ?
Come clean !
- I think it would be wise ...
I don &apos;t know where the Beaugard is .
Why did we find this in your room ?
You &apos;d better come with me .
You can &apos;t take him .
This program is coming to you from the House of David .
Either this suit is on upside-down or there is no law of gravity .
Einstein or no Einstein .
- My tie !
Captain , what shall I do ?
They &apos;re going to arrest John .
Who ?
- I am !
In Scotland Yard they teach you never to arrest an innocent man .
He &apos;s not innocent .
I &apos;ll have to arrest him .
Of course , or nobody &apos;s safe here .
You can &apos;t arrest him .
I stole it .
- Don &apos;t listen to her .
I did it .
They &apos;re both lying .
I did it . - He &apos;s crazy .
I confess .
I did it .
Maybe there was no painting .
- That &apos;s right .
I saw it .
Stop this !
Who stole the painting ?
I did !
- Good gracious .
You ? You took the picture ?
Where is it ?
Aw , that &apos;s a horse .
That is my Beaugard !
- No , that isn &apos;t your Beaugard .
Ridiculous .
I paid $ 100,000 for this . I know what I bought .
Look at the signature .
John Parker .
Somebody changed it .
That is my Beaugard !
That &apos;s it , I tell you .
But that one has the color , the depth , the soul of the Beaugard .
Only a master could have produced a painting like that .
You mean , you painted it ?
- Yes , sir .
- You &apos;re a genius .
I commission you to paint a portrait of me immediately .
It &apos;ll have to wait until tomorrow .
I &apos;m going to be busy all day .
- Yes .
You come with me .
- Don &apos;t take him away , officer .
He returned the paintings .
My name is Spaulding .
I &apos;ve always wanted to meet you .
Alright . Just this time .
But I want to tell you something .
You &apos;re running around with the wrong people .
You wanna be a crook ?
Why don &apos;t you go home ?
- He &apos;s got no home .
Go home and stay home .
Your poor old mother sits there sits there , night after ... night after night ... waiting to hear your steps on the stairs .
And I can see a little light burns in the window .
No you can &apos;t !
The gas company turned it off .
What I &apos;m telling you is for your own good .
And if you listen to me , you can &apos;t go wrong .
This may go on for years .
- There &apos;s just one thing ...
What &apos;s delaying that coffee pot ?
Where &apos;s the cream ?
- You certainly surprised me .
Me too .
I thought he had more .
- No use giving you any advice .
Captain , this time I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ll have to take him .
Oh , what are you doing ?
My dear !
What &apos;s the idea ?
- Take a letter to my lawyers .
Oh no , don &apos;t ! Anything but ...
That I &apos;ve got to go ! So young !
Good .
Let &apos;s get out of here before they all wake up . Hurry up .

Thank you .
Remember I &apos;m leaving everything in your care .
Be sure the person who rents my house is reliable . -A person you could trust .
-Goodbye , Colonel .
And don &apos;t forget to tell me ...
Thank heaven he &apos;s gone .
South Africa has my sympathies .
What &apos;s the matter ?
Have you seen two bozos running this way ? Sure .
They just went in there . What &apos;s wrong ?
Trying to make a hotel out of the city park .
They put two benches together to make twin beds . -Yeah ?
When I told them to go , the little one tipped his hat and said :
That &apos;s what I &apos;m sore about .
He &apos;s gone .
Let &apos;s get out of here .
Another nice mess you &apos;ve gotten me into .
Yes , ma &apos;am .
Let &apos;s reconnoiter .
-Sure you have everything ?
-Certain .
-Come on or we &apos;ll miss the boat . -Alright .
is it really safe for us to go away and leave the place until Monday . Sure .
The colonel won &apos;t be back for at least six months .
What &apos;s the difference if we rent the house today or next week ? -lt &apos;s the same .
-Alright . Go on .
-Always starting an argument .
-And you &apos;re always blaming me .
Get over there . Come on .
Let &apos;s go out the side window .
-This must be the place .
-lt &apos;s perfectly splendid .
-lt reminds me of old England .
-lt &apos;s just the thing .
is it the cops ?
Who is Colonel Buckshot ? What &apos;s he like ?
No idea .
I &apos;ve never met him .
I hope he rents us the place .
It &apos;s somebody to rent the place .
-What &apos;ll we do ?
Use your brains .
Put on the butler &apos;s clothes and say the colonel &apos;s not home .
It &apos;s simple .
-Yes , but if they don &apos;t ... -Why you ...
Wait .
I hear someone coming .
is this the home of Colonel Wilburforce Buckshot ?
Yes , sir .
I understand it &apos;s for rent .
is it ?
I mean , it is .
Of course it is .
I am Lord Leopold Plumtree .
My card .
The colonel isn &apos;t home .
-You wish to see the colonel ?
-l &apos;d love to .
Wait there .
What it is , Hives ?
Lord Appletree .
He wants to rent a room .
No , no . Plumtree .
Lord Leopold Plumtree .
And I want to rent the entire house .
Show then to the solarium .
I &apos;ll be right down .
This way .
Good morning .
Many good mornings .
Have I the pleasure of addressing Colonel Wilburforce Buckshot ?
None other .
Colonel Buckshot at your service .
I &apos;m Lord Leopold Plumtree .
-Delighted .
-My wife . Charmed .
We &apos;ve just returned from our honeymoon .
The hotel is full and my dear wife suggested we rent a furnished home .
We &apos;d like to take possession immediately .

That chair is an old heirloom .
There &apos;s a picture I must show you .

I &apos;m still nervous .

Kind of a hospital .
-How noble of him .

How many maids does the colonel keep ?
-He never tells me his private affairs .
-Private affairs ?
Servants aren &apos;t private affairs .
Some of them are .

The others left last week .
They had housemaid &apos;s knees .
Agnes , would you like to stay on with us ?
Don &apos;t disappoint me . Say you will .
You &apos;ll be a comfort to me .

-Certainly , dear . And what good news I have .
With the colonel &apos;s permission , Agnes has agreed to stay on .
She &apos;s been in my service since boyhood .
I mean girlhood .
You return to the depot and attend to our trunks while I go over details with dear old Buckie ?
Quite right , Plumie . -Come , Agnes , see me off .
-Yes , ma &apos;am .
Agnes , call me a cab .
-Huh ? -Call me a cab .
You &apos;re a cab .
On the telephone !
Absolutely .
What &apos;s the rental fee ?
-ls $ 20 a month too much .
- $ 20 a month ? Yes .
That &apos;s practically giving it away .
I picked it up for practically nothing .
is it for sale ? It could be purchased .
By the way , have you any horses ?
Sorry . I &apos;ve just shipped them to my plantation in Kentucky .
Kentucky ? What part of Kentucky are you from ?
Dear old Omaha .
I thought Omaha was in Wisconsin .
About Agnes &apos; salary .
Don &apos;t worry .
That &apos;s not due until next month . Agnes , call Hives .

Colonel , you &apos;re an easy man to do business with .
So they &apos;ve told me . The last the deal we had ...

Agnes .
That &apos;s my cab .
Get my hat and coat and go to the door .
-You wish to see Colonel Buckshot ?
Nothing would suit me better .

Progress .
Denise BAUDU , an orphan .
EVERYTHING ... YOU WANT ...
AT LADIES &apos; PARADISE
Mr. Baudu in Paris , 6 Courteline St.
( across from the store Ladies &apos; Paradise )
&quot; Uncle , you &apos;re the one who wrote and told me to come . &quot;
&quot; I wrote you , it &apos;s true ...
when your father died six months ago , but since then ... &quot;
&quot; Since then ...
everything has changed ... business is very bad . &quot;
&quot; The department store is destroying us .
Everyone is closing down ...
How can I provide for you ? &quot;
&quot; Maybe I can get a job across the street ... at Ladies &apos; Paradise ? &quot;
&quot; Work for Mouret ?
That charlatan who sells at a loss in order to ruin us ? &quot;
&quot; That wretch doesn &apos;t care if the little guys starve to death ! &quot;
&quot; Come ... We &apos;ll give you some lunch first . &quot;
CLOSED FROM NOON TO 2 PM
&quot; Geneviève !
Don &apos;t you recognize your cousin , Denise ? &quot;
&quot; This is Colomban , my future son-in-law .
A good young man who helps me as best he can . &quot;
&quot; My poor girl , I can &apos;t let you share in our misery .
Try to find some work . &quot;
Rising out of the earth at the behest of one man : Octave Mouret .
The department store , Ladies &apos; Paradise , Temple of Temptation .
&quot; Excuse me , could you tell me where to go to apply for a job ? &quot;
Sebastien JOUVE Employee Manager
&quot; We have one opening for a model .
Come with me . &quot;
&quot; Take your clothes off ! &quot;
&quot; I want my stores to take over the whole neighborhood in two years ! &quot;
&quot; Great plan , Mr. Mouret !
But there &apos;s one shop you can &apos;t get rid of :
The one that belongs to old Baudu ! &quot;
&quot; His shop , Vieil Elbœuf , is mortgaged to the hilt , it &apos;ll succumb like all the others ...
I &apos;ll buy everything up ! &quot;
&quot; Fine !
But ... where will you get the money ? &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Desforges is introducing me to a man this evening who has more money than he can count ,
Baron Hartmann . &quot;
&quot; That boy is engaged .
You should leave him alone ... &quot;
&quot; Is it any of your business ? ! &quot;
&quot; Get out of here ! &quot;
&quot; I like that girl ...
Hire her . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m the one who did you that favor . &quot;
&quot; Thanks to you I was hired immediately ...
I wanted to thank you . &quot;
&quot; They put me in the beauty products section . &quot;
&quot; Thank you ... I live across the street at my uncle Baudu &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; Poor uncle ... He says Mr. Mouret , our boss , wants to ruin him . &quot;
At Mrs. Desforges &apos; house .
&quot; Mr. Mouret , this is Baron Hartmann ,
He likes and supports big projects . &quot;
&quot; Old buildings , worthless shops , I &apos;ll raze everything ... and I &apos;ll make Ladies &apos; Paradise the biggest store in the world ! &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s an ambitious project and an interesting idea ... But who are your customers ? &quot;
&quot; All of the women in Paris ...
He who rules the women rules the world ! &quot;
&quot; I want to build a temple of elegance , luxury and beauty , your temple , ladies ...
In this undertaking , you &apos;ll all be with me ! &quot;
&quot; You seem to use women too easily , my dear man ...
People get hurt in that game .
Beware , one day one of them may avenge the others . &quot;
Baron Hartmann has given his millions in support ...
All around the Vieil Elbœuf shop demolition work is under way .

&quot; Will you be among us ? &quot;
&quot; What do you think of our new model ? &quot;
&quot; Mr. Mouret is taking an interest in that girl ...
No doubt , she was recommended ... &quot;
&quot; Why are you making fun of that girl ? &quot;
At L &apos;lsle-Adam .

I set you up . I can bring you down ! &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t live without you .
I &apos;ll come for you tonight . &quot;
&quot; Where are you going ? &quot;
&quot; Why are you leaving ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s because she &apos;s ill , very ill ...
That &apos;s why , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; I thought you had a heart . You &apos;re nothing but a scoundrel ! &quot;
&quot; All this poverty !
That &apos;s why I &apos;m leaving . &quot;
&quot; What kind of future is this ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m young ... I want to live ! &quot;
&quot; My daughter is young too ... She would like to live ... &quot;
&quot; I know what you &apos;re worth now .
I understand . &quot;
&quot; I know where you &apos;re going . &quot;
&quot; Over there ... With the high and mighty ! &quot;

&quot; See him ... One last time ...
Denise ... I &apos;d like to ... &quot;
&quot; What is Mr. Mouret doing ?
I haven &apos;t been able to get through to him for two days ! &quot;
&quot; Let him not forget that I &apos;m the one in control of this business ! &quot;
&quot; I left everything for Clara .
I loved her ... She didn &apos;t care about me ! &quot;
&quot; Geneviève is going to die ! &quot;
&quot; Come ...
You &apos;ll understand ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sorry ... &quot;
&quot; Get out of here ! &quot;
At the request of Mr. Mouret , an eviction notice has been issued ...
&quot; Soundrels ! Scoundrels ! &quot;
Murderer &apos;s accomplices ! The man who &apos;ll starve us all !
I &apos;ll kill you all ! &quot;
&quot; I hate you ! &quot;
The storm blows over .
&quot; For sentimental reasons you are seriously damaging our business ! &quot;
&quot; I thought you were stronger ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve invested millions , I have to defend them ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not going under with you ! &quot;
&quot; Pull yourself together or reisgn ! &quot;
&quot; Do whatever you like ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a ruined man ! &quot;
&quot; I thought I was doing something useful .
I &apos;ve only created more pain and destruction ! &quot;
&quot; I give up ... &quot;
&quot; You served Progress .
It &apos;s the one to blame . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re the ones who were wrong .
I see that now . &quot;
&quot; Be proud of your work .
Be strong , so that it will continue . &quot;
&quot; Denise ... I would have been strong if you had loved me . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve always loved you ...
I &apos;ve loved only you . &quot;
&quot; You can be satisfied .
I have him !
He &apos;s going to resign . &quot;
&quot; Destruction , misery ...
Tomorrow all of that will be part of the past . &quot;

&quot; Together , the two of us will make it come true . &quot;
HAPPINESS

Then you should know to remove your hat in my dressing room . But what does it mean that it makes money ...
- I must think about my work , my dear . - Calm down , this is nonsense !
What do you want here , anyway ?
I &apos;m here on official business . You &apos;re corrupting my pupils .
Really ?
Think I &apos;m running a kindergarten ?
Well ?
Now you say nothing at all .
Man , you &apos;re a regular roadblock ! # #
Look what crawled in .

I &apos;m dropping my pants .
You !
You ! I don &apos;t want any trouble !
So , how do you like me now ?

- No , I &apos;m here ...
- I can see you &apos;re here . And I &apos;m delighted over it !
Why wasn &apos;t I told ?

Keep your shirt on .
What a dame !
Herr Professor , you have a impeccable taste .
How dare you !

&quot; And then he says &quot;
&quot; Miss , I couldn &apos;t care less ! &quot; Come right in , Herr Professor !
We were waiting impatiently .
&quot; I knew you would return . &quot; &quot; With me , they all come back &quot;
I knew you &apos;d be back ! They all come back for me .
My dear Fräulein ...
I ... ln my haste yesterday instead of my hat ... I took this ... Item of clothing .
So you didn &apos;t come to see me ?

Here , hold this .
Pretty eyes , huh ? Aren &apos;t they pretty ?

Tonight ... You &apos;re not here in your official capacity .
I &apos;m afraid that last night I may have ... Behaved somewhat unseemly . Yes , you did .
Today you &apos;re much nicer .
Pardon !
Hey , Herr Professor ... Send me a postcard when you are ready .
You &apos;re a sight !
Hold still .
If your boys could see you now !
Let &apos;s get back to work .
Actually ...
Actually you are ...
A rather handsome man .
God , am I sorry !
Is it so bad ?
It hurts , yes ?
No .
- All better now ?
- Yes .
Sorry to intrude , Herr Professor .
Why aren &apos;t you drinking in here ? There &apos;s a sailor loaded with cash .
I don &apos;t care . Send out Guste .
Are you crazy ?
Who &apos;d buy her champagne ? He wants you !

Leave me alone ! Take and get out of here .
I won &apos;t do any such thing .
You miserable villain ! Get out !

How dare you molest the lady !
Are you subscribed to the lady ? - But Herr Professor !
- Quiet ! - White slave trader ! - What ?
You heard me , out !
Get out ! Out !
But Herr Professor ! What &apos;s got into you ?
Miserable pimp !
Who do you think you are , kicking him out ?
The man ordered champagne ! I &apos;ll pay all !
Leave the premises .
Get out !
He called me a white slave trader !
Please , Captain , don &apos;t make such a racket .
You &apos;ll rouse the cops ! Yessir !
The cops !

You crook !

He tried to murder me !
Bravo ! Bravo !
Someone defending me ?
Hasn &apos;t happened in ages . I have only done ...
My duty .
No need to get all worked up , Professor . Let &apos;s have ourselves a drink .
Cheers !
May I propose ...
A toast to you ...
My dear lady .
Forgive me , Herr Professor , but ... The police are here .
The police ?
- The police ?
- They mustn &apos;t find you .
I &apos;ve nothing to fear . Not you , maybe , but we do !
You &apos;d better lay low , Herr Professor .
I &apos;ve nothing to fear ... From the authorities .
We could rent rooms down there .
He lunged at me like a madman . Yes , he &apos;s drunk !
Just hold on ...
This man claims he was assaulted here . He tried to murder me !
To murder me ! Who did ?
Well , who then ? Where &apos;d the hoodlum disappear ?
Him , Officer ! He attacked me on stage .
Just keep out of this .
Where &apos;d you hide him , you crook ? How should I know , you old boozer ?
I wasn &apos;t even there .
Come on , out you come !
Little rascals , I finally caught you !
The game is up !
I caught you !
Get going !
It &apos;s all over now !
Come on !
You too ! All of you !
You hooligans !
Hooligans ! There he is !

Arrest the lout !
- Pipe down ! - No one &apos;s going to silence me !
- We &apos;ll see .
Off to the station with you .
He tried to murder me !
He called me a slave trader !
I presume you &apos;re aware ... That this incident will have consequences .
Take that cigarette out of your mouth .
I said take that cigarette out of your mouth . The truth !
What do you come here for ?
The same as you , Herr Professor . Get out !
Out !
You &apos;ll regret this !
Well done , Prof.
Here , down the trap she goes .
- Garbage ! - Garbage !
Garbage !
You miserable rascals !
You haven &apos;t heard the last of this !
You haven &apos;t heard ... You haven &apos;t heard ... You haven &apos;t ...
Goodness , what &apos;s wrong , Herr Professor ? I &apos;ll be all right .
I &apos;ll be ... I feel better already .
Those lousy bums !
Some profession you chose .
Damn that bell ! What &apos;s going on here ?
You going to order ?
The place is half empty !
Stop complaining !
Who brought the skipper in ?
Get going , wiggle your fannies .
Come out with us , Herr Professor !
A little music will put you right .
You landed a few good punches ... But I &apos;m not the kind ...
Who bears a grudge .
Herr Professor ... I &apos;m going to give you ... A little shot ... From my personal medicine cabinet .
Do you really think this will help ? Sure , it &apos;ll set you back on your feet .
Yes ?
Yes ! Now you can show your face .
- Why ? - Come with me . - Where ?
- The reserved seats .
- What for ?
- To hear Lola sing .
- Lola ? - Yes ! Yes ...
Lola !
&quot; An enigmatic glimmer &quot; &quot; A je-ne-sais-pas-quoi &quot;
&quot; Flashes in the eyes &quot; &quot; Of a beautiful woman &quot;
&quot; But when my eyes look deeply &quot; &quot; At the man vis-à-vis &quot;
&quot; And gaze intently at him &quot; &quot; What do they mean ? &quot;
&quot; I am , from head to foot &quot; &quot; Made up of love &quot; &quot; Because that is my world &quot;
&quot; what should I do ? &quot; &quot; ... my nature &quot; Quiet !
Ladies and gentlemen ... It is my pleasure ...
To introduce our guest of honor for the night . Dr. Immanuel Rath !
Professor ...
At the local college .
&quot; I am , from head to foot &quot; &quot; Made up of love &quot; &quot; Because that is my world &quot;
&quot; what should I do ? &quot; &quot; ... my nature &quot; &quot; I just can &apos;t hold but love &quot;
&quot; Men swarm all about me &quot; &quot; Like moths around a flame &quot;
&quot; And if they burn &quot; &quot; Well , you can &apos;t blame me for it &quot;
&quot; I am , from head to foot &quot; &quot; Made up of love &quot; &quot; I just can &apos;t hold but love &quot;
&quot; I am , from head to foot &quot; &quot; Made up of love &quot; &quot; Because that is my world &quot;

&quot; Men swarm all about me &quot; &quot; Like moths around a flame &quot; &quot; And if they burn &quot;
&quot; Well , you can &apos;t blame me for it &quot;
&quot; I am , from head to foot &quot; &quot; Made up of love &quot; &quot; I just can &apos;t hold but love &quot;
The breakfast !
Good morning .
I &apos;m afraid I may have overindulged last night . A few bottles of champagne . You held it just fine .
One ?
Two ?
Three . You really are a sweet one !
Delicious . Extraordinary !
You see ?
You could have this every day .
After all , I &apos;m not married .
I must hurry ... And get to the school !
Stand still ! So !
To make you think of me !
Give me a kiss .
Do you love me too ? Yes , yes !
Yes , yes ! Good-bye !
You , watch out for the traffic .
Morning .
Herr Professor , it stinks of garbage here ! Garbage !
Garbage !
I &apos;ll have you all locked up !
Miserable brats !
Go to the school yard . I &apos;ll deal with you later .
But to risk one &apos;s entire future for that kind of woman ?
I beg your pardon , Herr Director .
You are speaking of my future wife !
I am completely serious ! I will not hear another word !
But I &apos;ll have to report the matter .
Come in !
- Why &apos;d I marry you ?
- I wonder about that too . Put the flowers in here .
And don &apos;t crush them .
Why are you standing there ?
You know the way !
My dear Miss Lola , I ...
I &apos;ll be back next year .
My dear Miss Lola , I brought you something else as well .
Would you accept this gift from me ?
And at the same time may I ask for your hand ? You want to marry me ?
I hope , my child ...
You are fully aware of the gravity of this moment .
Long may they live ! Three time up ! Long may they live !
Three time up ! Long may they live ! Long may they live !
Three time up ! - To your health , Lola ! - To this happy day !
Ladies ...
My very honorable gentlemen !
- It gives me great pleasure to ...
- Enough ... Enough of your blather !
Here we go again .
My wedding ceremony was like this , so lovely . If I had known you then ...
Perhaps I &apos;d be the wife of a professor now ...
Instead of this conjurer .
That &apos;s right , I am a conjurer !
We &apos;re in for more of his stupid stunts !
Sit down now ! Would you deny the professor a display of my art ?
With your permission ... I &apos;ll pull a few eggs from under your nose .
Here , take it , please !
There &apos;s something to be proud of .
Watch this , Herr Professor .
Honey , hand me my small case .
Ah !
Why did you bring the postcards ?
What a dumb question .
We sell them every night ! As long as I &apos;ve a penny to my name , they will not be sold !
Well , you never know !
&quot; Beware of blonde women &quot;
&quot; They have a certain something &quot; &quot; You may not see it all at once &quot;
&quot; But whatever it is , it &apos;s there &quot; &quot; A little glance exchange &quot;
&quot; Can you indulge in &quot;
&quot; But always keep in mind : &quot; &quot; Beware of the predator ! &quot; &quot; Beware of blonde women &quot;
How &apos;s business ?
Two postcards .
This uneducated pack !
Uneducated pack ? You &apos;re a fine one to talk !
You need a shave , just look at you !
Who &apos;d buy a postcard from you ?
Go ahead and stare .
He &apos;s right , you know . You really should shave .
And anyway , what &apos;s the idea of calling them ...
An &quot; uneducated Pack &quot; ?
We make a living off them .
Yes !
We make a living off them ...
We live . If you don &apos;t like it , go .
Yes , I &apos;ll go .
I &apos;ll go . I &apos;ll go .
I can &apos;t stand it anymore ! I &apos;d rather die like a dog than lead this life another day .
Well then ... Hand me my stockings .
Quick , the curling iron .
It &apos;s way too hot !
Well , Professor , how are we today ?
Care for a cigar ?
Our manager appears to be in high spirits .
I have every reason to be !
You should be pleased too .
You &apos;re going to be my top attraction !
Don &apos;t rib the old guy .
- He hasn &apos;t hurt you . - You stay out of this .
Your husband &apos;s a big star .
Here ...
A contract , confirmed by cable .
And where ? At the Blue Angel .
- The Blue Angel ? - Yes !
We &apos;re returning to your hometown .
We &apos;ll hang large posters :
Professor Immanuel Rath !
Never ! I &apos;ll never go back to that city !
You &apos;ll change your mind .
I will not change my mind .
Isn &apos;t that just like you ?
For five years you &apos;ve lived off this woman .
And now ...
When you finally can earn a few cents ...
Herr Professor says : No , I won &apos;t go !
- Leave him alone ! - No ! - He will go .
- I won &apos;t !
We &apos;re leaving early tomorrow .
That &apos;s final . No , I won &apos;t go !
Never !
You can ask anything of me ... But not that ! - Don &apos;t get all worked up !
- No ! I won &apos;t do it .
- Never ! - No one &apos;ll force you .
Goodbye !
Good day , Herr Director !
Hello , Herr Director !
You finally made it !
I never thought I &apos;d ever crawl back into this hole .
My place a hole ?
She has not changed in the last five years , my wife !
You &apos;ve not become much thinner , Herr Director !
You haven &apos;t lost any weight , Herr Director !
You &apos;re no slimmer either !
Good day , Herr Director !
- Why should I ...
- Business is good !
- Glad to hear it . And you ?
Better now , but the last few days ...
Terrible !
Goodbye , Herr Generaldirector !
Goodbye , Maestro .
But hopefully not for the next ten years !
This dump is good for catching fish , not for my class act .
Au revoir ...
Mon petit ...
Cochon ! Who &apos;s that phenomenon ?
- Day , Lola !
So many handsome guys here in one spot ?
Don &apos;t pile the bags in a heap . How should one unpack ?
It &apos;s unbelievable !
They just dumped them . - Take out the costumes .
- Everything on the earth ! - Nice .
- Hanging , hanging !
Don &apos;t miss your train !
Man ... What do you know about love ?
Do not move !
Girls , girls !
Once on stage and not a ...
This costs me money , ladies , it costs me money !
Had I hired a piping oil sardine ...
Hanni !
Permettez-vous , madame !
Allow me to introduce myself .
Mazeppa . Hans Adalbert Mazeppa , Strength Act !
- And ?
- And , I &apos;m staying on !
For you ! That &apos;s the kind of guy I am , a man of action !
Don &apos;t be so hasty !
You have time , right ?
I can &apos;t wait two hours !
Please , go home quietly .
&quot; Beware of blonde women &quot; &quot; They have a certain something &quot; &quot; You may not see it all at once &quot;
&quot; A little glance exchange can you indulge in &quot; &quot; But always keep in mind : &quot;
&quot; Beware of the predator ! &quot;
&quot; Beware of blonde women &quot; &quot; They have a certain something ! &quot;
Tonight is crucial ... For your whole career .
If all goes well ... You &apos;ll be a made man .
Scala , in Berlin ...
Alhambra , in London ...
Hippodrome , in New York ...
Stop it ! It &apos;ll go to his head .
- This is the Blue Angel !
- You can be a killjoy ! - What can you be , then ?
- Stop squawking !
- Where &apos;s his nose ?
- Nose ? The nose !
You had it !
I had it ? You had it , you mean !
I had it , did I ?
Don &apos;t mind him , Professor .
I know exactly how you feel .
I was just as excited twenty years ago with my first success .
Couldn &apos;t you shut up for couple of minutes , yes ?
Chairs ! Chairs !
Even the mayor is here !
Don &apos;t be nervous , Herr Professor !
The house is sold out !
Everybody &apos;s here !
You &apos;ll see , your colleagues , your students !
Everyone !
What a crowd ! Don &apos;t get nervous , Herr Professor !
He is quite right !
Just stay calm !
Don &apos;t let it get to you !
Take example from me ! The moment of truth !
Whenever I spy a beautiful dame , I move right in !
That &apos;s my trademark !
What &apos;s the matter ?
Why the long face ?
Every time I have some fun , you sit there moping .
What &apos;s going on here ?
Stormy weather ?
Happens in the best families !
Allow me to introduce myself .
Name &apos;s Mazeppa , Hans Adalbert Mazeppa ...
Strength Act .
What are you waiting for ?
Go do your slapstick show !
What &apos;s up with the old guy ?
Well , Herr colleague ... A little strong one , what ?
Can never do any harm !
The young one is not quite right .
Goodness , what are you doing ?
What is it ?
What &apos;s the matter ?
Lola , come down here !
I won &apos;t go on !
What &apos;s up with you ? Have you gone crazy ?
You can &apos;t back out on me a minute before showtime !
What &apos;s got into you ?
You don &apos;t want to go on ?
You will go on !
Put on the wig .
What do I hear ?
He won &apos;t go on ? Are you crazy ?
Nobody does that to me !
- Get on stage !
- Move it , man !
Ladies and gentlemen ... I apologize for the slight delay .
A small technical problem .
Someone have a bellyache ?
The next number will more than make up for it ... A Conjuring Act ... Of truly international class .
As a special part of our performance ... It is my pleasure to introduce to you ... As a very special attraction ...
Out with the professor ! Send in the Professor !
I can see , ladies and gentlemen , I need say no more .
I won &apos;t test your patience any longer .
Please welcome our beloved ... Professor Immanuel Rath !
Watch it !
Or you &apos;ll completely ruin my act ! Go ! Go !
Ladies and gentlemen ... May I introduce ...
August ... My apprentice sorcerer .
Herr Conductor ?
Ladies and gentlemen ...
As you can see , I work without props ... Just my two hands and my ten fingers . What you see here , ladies and gentlemen ...
Is an ordinary top hat ...
An original British top hat .
There &apos;s no double bottom ... No secret opening , no trap door .
This top hat , ladies and gentlemen ... I shall now place ... On the head of my August ...
And will make so bold as to produce ... A live dove ... Before your very eyes !
Ladies and gentlemen ... I know you &apos;re all thinking ...
The magician has already set the dove in the hat . But no ... You are quite mistaken .
Please !
Empty !
Empty !
Here you go . If I may , here &apos;s more proof .
A dagger !
Here we go !
One ...
Four !
Ladies and gentlemen , please , don &apos;t be alarmed ... By the sight of this revolver in my right hand !
And now my August is no bird-brained anymore !
This is an outrage ! Call the police !
Bravo !
Bravo !
Herr Director ... I &apos;ve run out of eggs !
Could you conjure up a few eggs for me ?
Of course , Herr Director , with great pleasure . Ladies and gentlemen ... I &apos;ll permit myself to produce some eggs ...
From the nose of my August ... To conjure up ... Pull yourself together , August !
I mean , you were a Professor !
Ladies and gentlemen , I know you &apos;re convinced ...
My August already has the eggs under his top hat . Far from it !
One more dove ! The eggs !
Lay eggs !
Lay eggs !
Right away , ladies and gentlemen , right away ... I &apos;m at your service !
One ...
Three ... An egg !
Where &apos;s your cock-a-doodle-doo , man ?
A genuine ... Hen &apos;s egg .
Lay more eggs ! Lay more eggs !
Lay more eggs ! - Quiet here !
- Lay more eggs !
Lay more eggs !
If you don &apos;t crow , I &apos;ll kill you ! Once again !
One ! Two ! Three !
An egg ...
An authentic , genuine hen &apos;s egg !
Crow !
Crow a cock-a-doodle-doo !
Cock-a-doodle-doo !
Cock-a-doodle-doo !
Man , if you don &apos;t crow this time , I &apos;ll kill you !
Cock-a-doodle-doo !
Go on , do your cock-a-doodle-doo !
I haven &apos;t done anything yet !
What do you want from me ?
Let me go ! No !
Help it out a little bit here !
Come in !
Help me !
Come here !
You asked for it !
I don &apos;t get it , an educated man like you ...
All because of some dame !
Get some rest ! I &apos;ll have everything ...
Back to normal !
&quot; I am , from head to foot &quot; &quot; Made up of love &quot; &quot; Because that is my world &quot;
&quot; what should I do ? &quot; &quot; ... my nature &quot; &quot; I just can &apos;t hold but love &quot;
&quot; Men swarm all about me &quot; &quot; Like moths around a flame &quot; &quot; And if they burn &quot;
&quot; Well , you can &apos;t blame me for it &quot;
&quot; I am , from head to foot &quot; &quot; Made up of love &quot; &quot; I just can &apos;t hold but love &quot;

Are you dying , Semion ?
Yes , I &apos;m dying , Petro .
Well , die then .
And after your death let me know , where you are : in Paradise or in Hell and how you &apos;re doing .
Fine , Petro .
If possible , I &apos;ll give you notice .
For 75 years he has plowed the soil with oxen ...
That &apos;s no small achievement !
If I were a People &apos;s Commissar , I &apos;d given him the Order of the Banner of Labor .
There are no Orders for oxen , grandfather .
For what then ?
I could eat something .
Live well , I &apos;m dying .
Pears he has liked .
Go ahead , read on , friend !
The kulak Belokon sabotages our work , hides the seeds and kills the livestock ... &quot;
I &apos;m not giving it away !
I &apos;d rather kill it ... !
Now , father , the kulaks are finished .
We &apos;re getting machines as well .
Vasili , I think , you &apos;re not right in the head ...
When we have the machines , we &apos;ll take their land away .
I &apos;m saying , you &apos;re crazy ...
It will work without you .
You don &apos;t have to go .
The whole village is laughing already .
It &apos;s not the whole village that &apos;s laughing , father , just the kulaks and the stupid .
You &apos;re saying I &apos;m stupid ?
Not stupid , father , you just have grown old .
Oh , the village Komsomol is coming !
Then open the meeting !
These filthy dogs , splendid fellows !
Father !
I &apos;m going !
Semion , where are you now ?
Greetings , grandfather Petro !
Grandfather Petro , greetings !
Get lost , devil &apos;s brood !
It &apos;s moving !
It &apos;s moving !
It &apos;s moving !
It has stopped !
It has stopped !
It &apos;s moving !
It has stopped !
It has stopped !
Write : premises are lacking for collective seeds and livestock , but not wonderful buildings for the kulaks ...
It &apos;s moving !
It has stopped !
It has stopped !
I hear !
I hear !
I hear !
No water in the cooler .
I hear !
Comrade chairman !
In the city they want to know , if the tractor has arrived .
Comrade chairman , the tractor is standing still !
The tractor has arrived , the whole village witnessed it .
The tractor can &apos;t be standing still .
Go !
Go on then !
Go !
It has been accomplished !
The have brought it .
That &apos;s the end .
Grandfather Petro is right :
It has been accomplished !
May we prosper with the machines !
Now the kulaks can just mourn their field borders !
Beware , so your mother has nothing to mourn about !
We will see .
We will see .
It &apos;s happening , Choma !
Father !
Throw away these crutches !
Throw me up !
I &apos;ll pay for it !
Choma !
Vasili has plowed the field with the tractor !
Vasili !
Hey , Iwans !
Hey , Stepans !
Hey , Grizkas !
Have you killed my Vasili ?
Choma , you ?
I &apos;m asking you :
Have you killed Vasili ?
No , uncle , it wasn &apos;t me .
There is no God .
And there are no priests either .
I &apos;m asking you ...
Just like Vasili died for the new life , I &apos;m asking you , to bury him according to the new ways ...
Neither priests nor church servants beyond the grave ...
It have to be our boys and girls themselves ...
And they are to sing new songs about the new life !
Good , Uncle Opanas , we &apos;ll bury our Vasili ourselves .
Without priests or church servants .
And we &apos;ll sing new songs about the new life !
Without a priest !
Good , if there &apos;s no God ...
And if He exists after all ?
God , punish the sinners !
Punish them , God !
It &apos;s my Earth !
I won &apos;t give it up !
Punish them !
Where is the priest ?
He &apos;s in there .
Damn the kolkhozy .
Vasili !
Vasili !
The deadly hate of the enemy on poverty took Vasili away from you ...
Hey , you have-nots !
It &apos;s me !
Beat me up !
I &apos;d rather die , than give myself up !
With the iron horse of Bolshevism Vasili destroyed thousand year old fields !
I &apos;ve killed him at night !
At night , when everyone was sleeping !
And he walked on the street ... And danced !
... with his hot blood he wrote the class enemy the death sentence ...
And you , Uncle Opanas , mustn &apos;t grieve .
Vasili &apos;s fame will fly around the entire world like our Bolshevist airplane above !
THE END
Original German subtitles : Anette Wagner-Müller Custom English subtitles translated from German
The scorpion is an arachoid species found in various parts of the world
Its tail comprises five prismatic joints
The pincers , recalling those of the larger crayfsh are instruments of aggression and information
Its tail ends in a sixth joint a sac from which poison is injected by barbed sting
A lover of darkness , it burrows under stones to escape the glare of the sun
Antisocial , it ejects the intruder on its solitude
Such lightning strikes , such virtuosity in attack
Even a rat , for all its fury , falls prey to it
Some hours later
Stop it !
Perhaps I just happened to fall ?
No .
We saw nothing
is there any news , yes or no ?
Yes , the Majorcans are here
Quick , to arms !
To the rear !
What about Péman ?
I &apos;m done for
So are we , but we &apos;re going
Yes , but you &apos;ve got accordions hippopotamuses , wrenches mountain goats , and ...
Bollocks !
Let &apos;s go ... and paintbrushes
This stone , on the site where the Majorcans died marks the founding of the city of Imperial Rome
Once mistress of the pagan world , now secular seat of the Church
Aspects of its stoutest pillar , the Vatican
The landlord &apos;s terms are very favourable . We can move in at once Longing to see you , very soon now .
Your loving cousin
But the hurly-burly of modern life has overtaken the Imperial City
Sometimes on Sundays ...
Various picturesque aspects of the great city
Bandaged ?
Yes , it &apos;s been sore for over a week ls Daddy home yet , Mummy ?
Yes , he &apos;s in the dispensary
Then he &apos;ll dress for the party
We went out together this morning and engaged four of them
The little moustached one sang like the rest
Only a pianist is lacking
But our priest is a fine violinist I think the musicians we have will be enough
Six of them placed near the microphone will make more noise than sixty ten kilometres away I know sound gets lost in the open air but we could bring the guests in close
Get a move on .
The Majorcans will be arriving at nine
Bastard !
Filthy swine !
Keep your trap shut !
Want us to work you over ?
Here &apos;s a taste of the rough stuff !
Enough is enough ;
let me show you who you &apos;re dealing with
Let &apos;s have a look , then
The International Goodwill Society hereby appoints you its special delegate
This document testifies to our faith in you
We pray that you will prove worthy of this trust we place in you and successfully complete your goodwill mission
On your spirit of self-sacrifice and your proven valour depend many lives
Children , women , old men
The honour of our Fatherland rests on the outcome of this noble enterprise
At his magnificent Roman estate , the Marquis of X prepares for his guests
The Minister of the lnterior is on the telephone
You scoundrel !
You are entirely to blame !
You compromised me , too
Do you realize that not one child survived ?
Many women and old men perished , too
You &apos;re bothering me about a few brats ?
Filthy ruffian , you &apos;ve dragged me down with you !
Dishonoured me !
You can die for all I care !
Then listen to my last words ...
Has he gone ?
Are you sleepy ?
I was just falling asleep
Where &apos;s the light switch ?
At the foot of the bed
Your elbow &apos;s hurting me
Move your head closer , ; the pillow is cooler on this side
Where &apos;s your hand ?
That feels so good
Let &apos;s just sit here and not move
Are you cold ?
No , I was falling
I &apos;ve been waiting so long for him
What joy !
What joy in having killed our children
My love ... my love ...
Just as these feathers fell , but a long way away the survivors from the Château de Selliny emerged to return to Paris
120 days earlier , four godless and unprincipled scoundrels had , driven by their depravity , shut themselves away to indulge in the most bestial of orgies
To them , the life of a woman mattered no more than that of a fly
They took with them eight lovely adolescent girls to serve as victims for their criminal desires plus four women well versed in debauchery whose narrative skills would serve to stimulate their already jaded appetites whenever interest flagged
Here are the survivors of these orgies , leaving the Château de Selliny
First and foremost of the four instigators , the Duc de Blangis
How &apos;s that ?
Gotta hand it to you , Rico .
The old bean &apos;s working all the time .
- What &apos;ll it be , gents ?
- Spaghetti and coffee for two .
All right , sir .
&quot; Underworld pays respects to Diamond Pete Montana . &quot;
- What &apos;s that gotta do with the price of eggs ?
Diamond Pete Montana .
He don &apos;t have to waste his time on cheap gas stations .
He &apos;s somebody .
He &apos;s in the big town doing things in a big way .
And look at us .
Just a couple of nobodies , nothing .
Is that what you want , Rico ?
A party like that for you ?
&quot; Caesar Enrico Bandello .
Honored by his friends . &quot;
I could do all the things that fella does and more .
Only I never got my chance .
And what &apos;s there to be afraid of ?
When I get in a tight spot , I shoot my way out of it . Why , sure .
Shoot first and argue afterwards .
You know , this game ain &apos;t for guys that &apos;s soft .
Yeah , there &apos;s money in the big town , all right .
And the women .
Good times , something doing all the time .
Exciting things , you know .
The clothes I could wear .
And then I &apos;d quit , Rico .
I &apos;d go back to dancing , like I used to before I met you .
I don &apos;t know . I ain &apos;t made for this sort of thing .
Dancing .
That &apos;s what I wanna do .
Dancing ?
Women ?
And where do they get you ?
I don &apos;t want no dancing .
I &apos;m figuring on making other people dance .
- Oh , I ain &apos;t forgetting about the money .
- Money &apos;s okay , but it ain &apos;t everything .
Be somebody .
Look hard at a bunch of guys and know they &apos;ll do anything you tell them .
Have your own way or nothing .
Be somebody .
- You &apos;ll get there , Rico .
- Yeah .
- You &apos;ll show them .
- You know this was our last stand in this burg .
We &apos;re pulling out .
- Where are we going ?
- East .
Where things break big .
So I beat it east , like I told you .
That &apos;s all there is to it .
I wanna run with your mob , if you &apos;ll let me .
What do you say ?
You won &apos;t be sorry for letting me in .
I &apos;ll do anything you say .
I ain &apos;t afraid of nothing .
You think you &apos;re a hard guy ?
There &apos;s nothing soft about me .
Nothing yellow . I don &apos;t quit .
- You got an idea you &apos;re good , huh ?
- Give me a chance to show you .
- What do you know about me ?
- Oh , I heard plenty .
How you run things this end of town .
About this here Club Palermo , how it &apos;s your front .
I got told enough .
- I guess you &apos;re good with a rod too , huh ?
- Quick with it and sure .
Well , that don &apos;t go around here .
That &apos;s old stuff . This ain &apos;t the sticks .
Yeah , I get you .
All right .
You stick around .
But , remember , I &apos;m the boss . And I give all the orders .
And when we split , we split my way .
- And no squawks .
You get me ?
- Yeah , sure , Mr. Vettori .
- All right , come on in , meet the boys .
- Sure .
Oh , they &apos;re 100 percent , all right .
Every one of them .
There &apos;s Tony Passa .
Can drive a car better than any mug in the town .
Otero .
He &apos;s little , but he &apos;s the goods all right .
Bat Carilla .
Killer Peppi .
Kid Bean .
And this one here , Scabby . What a smart guy he is .
Boys .
Come on , Tony .
Wake up .
I want you to meet a new guy what &apos;s gonna be with us .
This is ...
Caesar Enrico Bandello .
Oh , Little Caesar , huh ?
Yeah , sure .
Where did you get the new dancer , DeVoss ?
Olga brought him around a few days ago .
Not bad .
- All right .
- I &apos;ll say he is .
Well , I got hold of a real dancer for a partner , didn &apos;t I , Mr. DeVoss ?
He &apos;s an elegant dancer .
We &apos;ll panic them after a few rehearsals .
Say , you &apos;re not trying to sell him to me , are you , Olga ?
Well , young fella , I guess 100 a week ought to buy you .
That &apos;s more than I generally start with .
That &apos;s swell with me , even though it don &apos;t buy no limousines .
Gee , thanks , Mr. DeVoss .
You &apos;ll never be sorry for this .
Come , Joey .
So it &apos;s you and me from now on .
Well , I &apos;m glad .
And I &apos;m not ashamed to tell you .
I guess you know by this time how I feel about you .
That &apos;s all right with you , isn &apos;t it ?
Or have you got another girl ?
A steady , I mean .
Hundreds of them , sure .
Only ...
Only , what &apos;s the difference ?
This is gonna be real .
- We &apos;ll make it mean something .
- Yeah , Joey , let &apos;s .
Because I need somebody .
Somebody like you .
Awful bad .
- You believe me , Olga ?
- I want to believe you .
What &apos;s that ?
What you got there , Joe ?
What are you doing with that ?
Can &apos;t you forget you &apos;ve seen it ?
It won &apos;t make no difference .
Not between us , Olga .
Don &apos;t worry , baby .
It &apos;s just a little good-luck charm I carry around with me .
Is that your racket ?
Maybe .
I suppose I got no right to ask you , Joe .
But now ...
Now that we got an understanding .
Couldn &apos;t you leave it ?
No .
I suppose I haven &apos;t got the right .
What would be the good of you asking , kid ?
Once in a gang ...
- You know the rest .
- I don &apos;t want to know .
Only maybe ...
Maybe it could be different this time .
If we try .
I &apos;ve never seen the guy that could get away with it yet .
Black . Seven .
Sam Vettori is still waiting for you in your office .
All right , I guess I &apos;ll have to see him .
I wonder what he wants here .
Hey , Ritz .
You &apos;d better stick with me .
I &apos;ll need you in there .
- That Sam Vettori &apos;s a no-good lug .
- You said it , boss .
Better let me go first .
Cut that .
Hello , Arnie .
Surprised to see me in your swell joint ?
Maybe I won &apos;t be after you tell me what you want here .
Oh , I &apos;ll tell you , all right .
Diamond Pete asked me to come up .
He &apos;s coming up too .
- Pete Montana ?
