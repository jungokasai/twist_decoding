Look around you.
Everything moves, everything orbits.
It is how we are born.
The Sun, the moon, the planets and the stars watch.
We are at the Centre.
Our place.
But, Nicolaus Copernicus came and said that the Sun stood at the Centre and that we moved around it.
Just like the other planets.
An Earth that moves?
But can't we see or feel that?
That was 1543.
Galileo made a telescope and pointed it at the sky in 1610.
He discovered moons around Jupiter and saw how these orbited around the planet in hours and days.
Later Christiaan Huygens and Dominique Cassini discovered moons around planet Saturn.
Everything seemed to orbit something.
Could it be true?
Johannes Kepler described these movements Isaac Newton caught them.
From apple to planet: everything obeyed his laws.
What about us?
We became usedto it and knew no better than the Sun stood at the Centre and we orbited around it.
And the stars that we see?
What about that band of nebulous light, the Milky Way?
Different cultures had given it different interpretations.
For the Egyptians it was Isis' wheat, the Incas saw it as golden star dust, for the Eskimos it was a band of snow and the Christians thought of it as the road to Rome.
It turned out that the Milky Way is made of stars:
hundreds, thousands millions of stars.
And then We discovered the nebulae.
Some were spiral shaped, other oval or irregular.
Where did they belong to?
How did everything fit together?
We, the stars, the Milky Way, the nebulae?
In the middle of the 19th century we knew that the stars were in fact like the sun.
That they must be very far away.
And that the Sun was very close by
And that was the Universe, a collection of stars
And our place in all that?
Spiral Galaxy the Milky Way unravelled
A film by Maarten Roos in collaboration with Pieter-Rim de Kroon
In the middle of the 19th century the introduction of photography
Before, astronomers had used visual techniques to map the stars of the northern sky.
Looking through a telescope they had swept the northern sky and catalogued each star, their positions and brightness,
up to a certain limit.
This catalogue of northern stars was also called a 'Durchmusterung', a German word for survey.
With the introduction of astronomical photography an astronomer at the southern hemisphere said:
'Let us complete the northern catalogue with all the southern stars, using photographic techniques'
This astronomer was David Gill, the director of the Observatory Cape of Good Hope.
I am sitting next to a photographic telescope very similar to the one used by David Gill.
To take photos with the telescope you need to constantly check that it stays pointed at the same part of the sky
You have to compensate for the daily apparent movement of the stars in the sky
So, there is a place where the photographic plate is put, about here.
That is the focal plane of the telescope.
Parallel to it, there is another telescope, here below.
You look through this second telescope with your eye to check that the instrument follows the stars correctly and at the same time an image is taken with the other telescope,
That could take several minutes or even longer.
When done, the exposed plate had to be changed for an unexposed one and the telescope pointed at a different part of the sky.
And this procedure continued until one had covered the entire sky with photographic plates
em started this big project to photograph the entire southern sky.
But he did not immediately think about measuring all these plates
Around the same time, the astronomer Kapteyn became professor of astronomy in Groningen (the Netherlands).
It was expected that he would get a big telescope, but for unknown reasons this did not happen.
And so Kapteyn thought:
'Well, there must be useful work to be done also without a telescope. '
And the idea was born. That he could collaborate With David Gill from the Cape Observatory to perform that huge task of measuring all the plates Gill had been collecting.
Both astronomers got into contact about this idea and it quickly led to an agreement:
Kapteyn would measure the plates, while Gill continued ro collect new ones.
One can ask whether they realised the size of such an undertaking.
Kapteyn began enthusiastically and it took him several years to finish the work.
It was published in three thick volumes. A copy can be found at the Kapteyn Institute in Groningen.
They contain nothing more than columns of numbers, indicating the positions and brightness of all stars on the plates.
This huge work became known as the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung.
It was this big achievement that lead Kapteyn to first distinguish himself at that time.
But in the meantime, he must surely have thought about other questions in Astronomy.
And one of those questions caught his attention early on: the properties of the ensemble of stars we see in the sky, the Milky Way Galaxy.
At the beginning of the 20th century around 1904, he made an important discovery in this area.
He noticed that the stars did not move randomly through Space, but that their movements had preferential directions.
Within the astronomical community that was a very important discovery: the fact that there was regularity in something astronomers had always considered to be chaotic!
Thanks to this discovery he established his name even more so, which helped him pursue his plans for further research on the Milky Way Galaxy in collaboration with institutions abroad.
At the end of his working life,
Kapteyn had constructed an idea about how the big ensemble of stars of which we are part, fits together.
He had found a model that best fitted all the data he had collected overtime:
information about distances and movements of the stars.
We now call this the Kapteyn model.
The Kapteyn model was much like a thick disc.
In the centre part of this disc the stars were densely packed in space.
And towards the edges of the disc the stars were further and further apart.
In terms of size, from the centre towards the edge of the disc was about 30,000 light years,
meaning that light has to travel 30,000 years to cover that distance.
In the direction perpendicular to the disc the size was much smaller, of the order of 7,000 light years.
So, it's a model that is quite easy to understand.
And Kapteyn must have felt it as a great satisfaction that he had found a model of which he could say: 'This is how things must be.'
Jacobus Kapteyn had found a model for the Universe:
a disc like structure with the Sun near the Centre.
It explained the Milky Way.
But there were other scientists who disagreed with this model.
New observations indicated that the Universe must be much bigger than what Kapteyn had proposed.
A big debate took place in the early 1920s.
It became clear that the spiral nebulae must be very tar away way beyond the borders of the Kapteyn Universe.
Slowly this new vision gained terrain.
And the idea that we were also part of such a flat spiral nebula began to grow
And that the Sun was not at the Centre.
At the end of the 1920s the young astronomer Jan Oort derived the rotation of the Galaxy from movements of the stars in the Sun's neighbourhood.
It also explained the star streams Kapteyn had discovered at the beginning of the 20th century
But how could we get an impression of the entire Galaxy?
Large quantities of dust between the stars obscured a clear view to distant parts and the Centre.
For twenty years people searched for a solution.
I studied astronomy and mathematics and physics of course.
In April / March 1943 all students had to sign a declaration of loyalty towards the german occupiers
It you did not want to do that, you had to work in Germany.
Most students did not want that either and they had to hide.
That is more easily said than done, because where to hide?
At a farm? But I did not know any farmers.
Or in the North-East Polder, where a lot of students hid.
I was lucky to hide here at this Observatory, together with a fellow student, Hans Hubbenet.
We came here in May 1943.
We were put in a small room, door locked, curtains closed, and we sat silently all day long.
After 6 p.m., when the Observatory's personnel had left, we were allowed to leave the room, but at 8 a.m. we had to be back.
And so we did day after day, and it went fine.
We were still in a scientific environment, so I could not have imagined any better place to hide.
There were a couple of other students as well.
Hans and I were the only ones hidden, but there was another student, three years older than me,
Henk van de Hulst.
Henk hacl finished his studies, except for the final exam, which he could not do, because the University was closed.
And he had one big advantage: he was an assistant at the Observatory.
So on his ID card was written: Assistant. Wehreas on mine it said:
And the Germans were arresting the students.
But an assistant could be an accountant's assistant or a pharmacy's assistant or anything else.
So Henk could move around freely.
Early in 1944 something happened that we found very special.
Henk received an invitation from Prof. Oort, the director of the Leiden Observatory, to come and work with him for a few months.
Today this is quite normal. But at the time, it was like going to a different continent!
Contacts were rare.
And Henk went to Leiden, and from time to time we received news about his stay, the people at Leiden, the things that were going on there.
Henk came back after a few months with a very intriguing story.
Oort had told Henk that in the years before the war,
American physicists and engineers had detected radio emission from the Universe.
That was something completely new and unheard of.
Where did that radio emission come from?
Oort wanted to detect and analyse that emission too, as soon as the war was over.
And he said: 'It would be so interesting, scientifically speaking, if there was a specific wavelength where the radio emission were stronger than at other wavelengths,
So that you could concentrate on that. '
And so he asked Henk:
'Since you are going back to Utrecht now, could you look into this hypothesis:
is there a wavelength where the radio emission is stronger than at other wavelengths? '
And so as we were hidden here, we heard this story.
We asked Henk how he would proceed and he said that he would check it With Prof. Rosenfeld.
Rosenfeld was a Belgium professor of theoretical physics, a real master of quantum mechanics, etc.
So, he went to see this professor.
And Rosenfeld asked him:
'What is the most abundant gas or element in the Universe?
Answer: 'Hydrogen, Professor.'
'Well ', he said,' then we should start by looking at hydrogen. And that's not so difficult, because hydrogen is the most simple atom that we know'
It consists of one electrically charged proton at the centre and one electrically charged electron that orbits the centre, just like a planet around the Sun.
And both proton and electron also spin around their own axis.
They can do that in the same direction Or in the opposite direction.
And in the first case the system has more energy than in the second case.
When the electron spin ﬂips, it loses energy,
Which is emitted as radio emission.
And Rosenfeld said: 'Henk, now you calculate at what wavelength that emission is radiated.'
Well, that was not too difficult, a quick, simple, calculation.
The answer was: 21 cm!
At a wavelength of 21 cm we could expect more radiation than at all the other wavelengths around it.
But the real question was: 'Is that radiation detectable?
'Because Rosenfeld quickly calculated that the probability of a spin flip occurrence, is very low.
Per hydrogen atom it happens once every ten million years!
Imagine, ten million years.
And when you hear that you think: 'There's no chance one can detect that radiation.'
But there is so much hydrogen in the Universe that adding all those tiny chances, a detectable amount of radiation should be produced.
Henk did some further work to determine how much radiation could be expected and he concluded that it should be possible to detect it.
In April 1944 there was a meeting of the Dutch Astronomy Club, the association of professional Dutch astronomers
They met three times a year, still today.
But back then there was only a small number of participants, because students could not attend and also because travel was difficult during the war.
At this small meeting Henk presented his prediction:
'We expect radio emission from the Universe at a wavelength of 21 cm and we, in the Netherlands, must make an effort to detect it, to discover it. '
The prediction by Henk van de Hulst was but a prediction.
It was impossible to do scientific experiments in those times, especially when this had to do with radio techniques.
But if it were true, if that emission really existed, it would be a very powerful tool to study the Galaxy.
Because emission from that wavelength went practically unhindered by the clouds of dust, so emission from all parts oi the Galaxy would be visible!
After the war, Oort immediately wanted to build a large telescope, with a diameter of 25 meter.
Yet, industry and technique were only slowly building again.
Financial support for such a project was also not available.
But Oort became impatient.
Fortunately the Dutch Telecommunication Service (PTT) had moved several german radar dishes from the dunes to the radio station at Kootwijk.
They were the so-called Würzburg dishes, that had been part of the Atlantic Wall.
Engineer De Voogt from the PTT made one of these dishes available for research on the Galaxy in 1948.
We hope this is the right spot.
No traces were left of the old radar mirror,
Which was removed in the late 50s.
We do see the old main building of the radio station and a few other buildings.
Looking at them we feel that this must be the right spot.
We are now in Hoeven, next to a german radar telescope, a Würzburg Riese.
I am a bit confused by the colour, because this white colour does not fit.
In fact, all those hundreds of radar telescopes, that formed the Atlantic Wall, had dazzle-painting green.
But for the rest it is a real Würzburg Riese telescope, 7.5 meters diameter, a small stair, everything.
In addition to a Würzburg mirror, a good receiver was also needed.
But 21 cm receivers did not exist at that time.
And at the Technical School at Delft, no engineers had been trained during the war.
Oort had to manage with a student of physics from Leiden, who started to try to put together a receiver.
Yet, after a year and a halt he had not made much progress and then he did something wrong and the entire receiver caught fire.
On March 10, 1950 a year and a half worth of work was lost.
Then Oort found a good engineer, someone from the new generation after the war:
Lex Muller.
In addition Muller was also an active radio amateur.
In the end of 1950 he came to work at the Dutch Foundation for Radio-emission from the Sun and the Milky Way Galaxy.
He came to Kootwijk and five months later he managed to deted the 21 cm line emission from the Milky Way Galaxy
May 11,1951.
One and a half month earlier a student at the Harvard University (USA),
Harold Ewen, had detected the emission for the first time.
No surprise, because the Americans had a huge advance because they had a lot of experience with microwave techniques, which they had developed during the war.
Henk van de Hulst was at Harvard at that time and he organised the communication between Harvard, Leiden and Kootwijk.
The results of those first detections were published together.
For several weeks Lex Mulder did test observation. And concluded that he needed a much better receiver in order to do a large survey
So, he took everything apart and spent a year building a better receiver.
In March 1952, just before the new receiver was finished, I went to Kootwijk for a month and a half to calibrate our radio telescope.
We had to know exactly in which direction the instrument would be pointing.
For this we needed new scale-indicators in azimuth and height, corresponding to the horizontal and vertical movements of the telescope.
Together with a technician from radio station Kootwijk we improved the existing scale-indicators.
Because they were inaccurate and had a wrong reference point.
We also determined the small errors that still remained, So that we could correct for them.
Once this was finished, in June 1952, the first large survey along the Milky Way equator started.
After my study of electronics, I came here in 1954.
There was a small cabin next to the telescope where I worked.
We mapped the Milky Way.
The observations were done day and night by students from Leiden, who came to Kootwijk.
There were always three students, one observed during the day, one during the evening and another during the night.
I supported them during the day and evening.
In the telescope there was a clock that needed to be set right.
In order to move the dish there were two handles, one tor the azimuth, one for the elevation.
Because the Earth rotates, one had to correct the position every three minutes.
Lists for these positions were prepared in Leiden.
It was a complete manual process.
The first series of measurements lasted one year from June 1952 through June 1953.
In the meantime, Henk van de Huist received an invitation from Oxford to give the famous Halley Lecture in May 1953.
In that lecture he wanted to show the first map of the distribution of hydrogen clouds in the Galaxy.
So, we had to make that map before his talk.
In order to put together the first map of the Galaxy, Oort, the director of the Leiden Observatory, organised a crash-action.
All the personnel of the Observatory participated.
I did too, together With my fellow students
Maarten Schmidt and Gart Westerhout.
We sat there, I'd almost say, locked up in the Observatory's lecture room for a week.
Our task was to process the observations from Kootwijk, do some calculations and give the results to Van de Hulst so that he could put together a map.
Everybody had a pile of observations from the same position in the sky.
Each observation was a registration oi the radio emission as a function of wavelength or frequency I have an example here.
This registration starts as a wiggling line near zero where there is no radio emission.
It rises to a maximum, a lot of radio emission.
It then drops a bit, rises again to an even higher maximum and finally drops back to zero.
What happened?
The receiver changed frequency very slowly over a one or two hour period.
It recorded the hydrogen radio emission at different frequencies.
Why was this done?
Well, I remind you of the Doppler effect that everybody knows from a passing police car or ambulance.
Such a car produces a sound of a certain tone.
And you know that as the car approaches, the tone sounds higher than when it moves away
The higher the tone, the higher the frequency of the sound wave (shorter wavelength).
And that depends on the speed of the car relative to you.
The same principle was applied at the radio receiver in Kootwijk.
It observed the radio waves emitted by hydrogen atoms.
When the atoms move towards us, we perceive a higher frequency, when they move away a lower frequency
Higher frequencies mean shorter wavelengths.
Lower frequencies mean longer wavelengths.
That principle has been applied here.
This registration shows the intensity of the radio emission at different frequencies.
That corresponds to the number oi hydrogen atoms moving at different velocities, in that one direction in the Galaxy.
Our task was to measure the radio intensities at different frequencies.
From these we determined the number of hydrogen atoms and we calculated their velocities.
In addition, several measurements had been done at each position, because the radio emission is weak and the receiver has quite some noise.
We needed to reduce the noise and so we had to repeat the measurements several times
We averaged three, five or ten of these in order to reduce the noise and amplify the signal.
And that was the product we delivered to Henk van de Hulst.
He then determined where in the Galaxy the hydrogen atoms with different velocities were located.
Here you see the result and you see that the hydrogen clouds form a spiral shaped band around the Galactic Centre.
Here is the Sun, here the Galactic Centre and the hydrogen clouds form an arm around it.
Very similar to what we knew from extragalactic spiral nebulae.
That was a first indication that our Galaxy has indeed spiral arms of hydrogen gas.
That was something completely new.
And that was the big surprise Van de Hulst unveiled during his lecture in Oxford:
based on the observations from Kootwijk, a spiral structure had been discovered.
After Van de Hulst's Oxford Lecture a second survey started in November 1953.
In this survey we not only observed along the Milky Way equator, but also 10 degrees above and 10 degrees below. We observed several hundreds of positions.
We measured the radio emission as a function of velocity and determined from those the positions of hydrogen clouds in the Galaxy. Not only in the equatorial plane, but also above and below.
We made a three dimensional map of the distribution of hydrogen gas in the Galaxy.
And so we mapped the entire Galaxy, as it was visible from the Netherlands, because from the Netherlands one can not observe the entire Galaxy.
That resulted in this beautiful colour map.
It was so nice that it proudly hang on a wall in the Observatory for months and went to several international conferences.
You can see four spiral arms.
The outer arm, that was also observed in the previous survey, and the dark coloured areas in the inner parts of the Galaxy.
But, as you can see, a part is missing.
That is the part that cannot be observed from the Netherlands.
However, colleague astronomers in Sydney, Australia had also started to do radio observations.
The leader of that group, Frank Kerr, tame to Leiden to collaborate.
He processed his data in a similar way as had been done by us in our surveys.
And this map shows the combination of the Dutch results, that we saw in colour just before, and the Australian results.
There is a difference between both parts.
The Dutch part of the map looks sharper than the Australian part, because of the slightly different methods of calculation used.
But the spiral arms from both parts do connect!
The triumphal point of the diagram is that you can clearly see that the hydrogen gas in the Galaxy is distributed in spiral arms.
Just like the paper's title says:
'The Galactic System as a Spiral Nebula. 'The Galaxy is a spiral galaxy.
Comparable to the spiral nebulae we have known for long from photographic observation, like this one.
That was the great result from the survey done at Kootwijk in collaboration with our colleagues from Sydney.
Our place had now been clearly shown:
a planet around a regular star at the edge of a regular galaxy with stars, gas and dust in spiral arms
A galaxy as there are millions and millions.
Dutch Astronomy had made a significant and valuable contribution to this new insight.
The Netherlands continue to play an important role in an area where new discoveries are still being made, new instruments are being developed and the frontiers of our know-how and knowledge are constantly being pushed out.

But do not think we have finished.
The change of vision that happened in the past one hundred years, take my word for it, will happen again in the coming one hundred years.
And we do not have the faintest idea how where that will lead.
We always have to be prepared that new perspectives will come that are now beyond our imagination.

Kiss of Death A crime play in 3 acts by A.V.Samsjö
Investigation on Dr Monro, dead on April the 1st, under mysterious circumstances.
The first witness was Mrs Anna Harper, a maid of the deceased.
"As I was laying the breakfast table..."
"... came the doctors little girl and said that something horrible had happened..."
"... the doktor lay dead outside the guest room..."
"A man I'd never seen before came and told me not to fuss with the child, and to instead let the police, whom he had called, in."
"Because of what the stranger said, the police arrested our servant."
Testimony of the second witness.
The second witness was chief engineer Weyler, head of the drawings department of United Mechanics. He said...
I must therefore warn you firmly: If the drawings aren't ready by the 1st of April the company is going to lose millions of crowns.
"I had suffered of an inexplicable tiredness and inability to work..."
"My neighbour and family doctor, Dr Monro, had regularly examined and treated me..."
"and I continued taking the medicine he prescribed, but became only more and more powerless..."
"My boss freaked out when he saw how slowly I worked."
"All drawings must be finished by April the First."
I can't stand your ignoring me! Your work seems to be more dear to you than your wife.
I have decided to go back to my parents.
You'll never see me again. Your jilted wife, Ruth.
"One day engineer Lebel came to visit me. He wanted to show me an invention."
"I made an astounding observation..."
"Can you see how similar we look!
Let me see your profile! "
"A crazy thought came upon me"
"I can't leave without losing my job, but you could fill in for me without anyone noticing and you would get the drawings done in time."
"First he found my proposal insane..."
"... but after we had exchanged clothes he seemed enticed by my plan"
"To get rid of any hesitation on his side, I proposed we conduct a test..."
"... when he moreover heard that my wife had left me, he agreed to my proposal."
"I myself travelled for a stay in a resting resort."
End of act 1
Kiss of Death second act
The testimony of the third witness.
The third witness was engineer Lebel and he tells of how he is one day visited by Monro, who is uncomfortably surprised to see him in good health.
So as not to raise suspicion he takes the medicine Monro brought, and consequently becomes very sick.
As Monro isn't available, a Dr Adell takes care of him. Dr Adell finds the case suspicious and after an examination of the medicine he can declare its dangerous nature.
Lebel recovers quickly and returns to work, during which he is disturbed by a visit by Weyler's wife.
He takes up his role and she notices nothing.
In the evening of March the 30th the last drawing is finished but it is stolen during the night.
Lebel says that he had a dreamlike vision of seeing a mysterious person move in the room.
"In the morning..."
"... I found out to my shock that the last, most important drawing had disappeared."
"Dr Adell promised to help me solve the mystery."
"When the night came we took our safety precautions."
"Once again I saw the mysterious figure..."
"He grabbed my hand to feel my pulse...
And said quietly to himself: Strange! This isn't Weyler! "
"Then he tried to break into the safe."
"Half numb from the impact we fell over... but, unharmed, I started following him immediately."
"I found no trace of the intruder... But further down the street I noticed a lonely wanderer..."
"To my surprise he turned out to be Dr Monro."
"He followed me back to the gate where we found the gas mask and the coat our mysterious guest had worn."
"Dr Monro volunteered to examine the mask at his home..."
"I decided to follow him anyway to be present during the examination."
"I asked Dr Adell to wait until I'd contact him and then went with Dr Monro."
End of act 2
Kiss of Death Third act
"I followed Dr Monro to his home."
"The door was locked from the outside."
"The next door was also locked...
but I heard sneaking steps on the other side... The key turned in the lock... "
"... and a little girl opened the door and asked for her father. It was Monros daughter."
"After the girl had gone back to bed, I went out to the hall and suddenly heard voices from a room."
Now Lebel finds out that the United Mechanics's most dangerous competitor was behind the poisoning attempts and the stolen drawings, and that now they were thinking of getting rid of him.
So as not to raise suspicion he accepts Monros invitation to stay for the night.
In the morning the servant serves Lebel hot chocolate that he leaves untouched.
Monros daughter comes in running.
In her enthusiasm she pushes on the tray and gets hot chocolate on her.
Dr Monro comes soon in, embracing and kissing her.
In a few seconds he collapses dead on the floor.
Dr Adell examined the contents of the sugar bowl and found a lethal posion.
"I found the stolen drawings that could be brought to the boss, and 'my wife' returned and happily threw herself onto my arms..."
"... but at due time also 'my wifes' husband!"
The end
Sir Arne's Treasure a winter ballad in five acts
During the reign of king Johan III a bitterly cold winter swept over Sweden, the likes of which had never been seen in living memory.
The king discovered a conspiracy among his Scottish mercenary troops.
The soldiers of fortune were ordered to leave, and were kept under guard until crossing the border.
Their leaders were bold and fearless men. They were arrested and sent to the tower.
... and the youngest, Sir Archie... Richard Lund
As long as they remained within the bounds of Swedish rule, they dare not reveal their identities.
They donned rough hides and claimed to be journeyman tanners, roaming the country in search of work.
... and by the time they reached the border, they were completely famished.
In those days, in Marstrand, there lived an impoverished fish hawker, a man known as Torarin.
Most of his time was spent on the road selling salted and dried fish. Torarin... Axel Nilson
"I have had great news today, Grim.
The sea has frozen over. Not only the bays and sounds -- but quite far out to sea. "
"Since we will pass by the vicarage at Solberga, we could stop there and ask if the ice will bear our weight all the way to Marstrand."
Generally, the dog was still and merely blinked at his master words.
But when he heard something that displeased him, he climbed on top of the load they carried, pointed his nose skyward, and howled.
"Dear dog, what do you have against Solberga?
Have we not many times swung past the vicarage to pay visit to Sir Arne? "
At the vicarage - the state known as Solberga - the vicar, Sir Arne, ate his supper in the company of his housefolk.
The vicar was an old man who retained his dignity and vigor. Sir Arne... Hjalmar Selander
While the years had not been kind to his wife. The vicar's wife... Concordia Selander
Seated on the other side of Sir Arne was the curate. Curate... Gösta Gustafson
At the far end of the table were Sir Arne's niece, Berghild, and her foster sister Elsalill, an orphan taken in by the vicar's household. Elsalill... Mary Johnson Berghild...
The only person present not belonging to the household was Torarin and his gaze kept returning to the iron-clad chest at the foot of the four-poster bed. This is were Sir Arne stored a fortune in silver coins, and it was said they filled the chest to the very brim.
Though Torarin was a man of little means, he had no desire to possess this fortune, for he had heard that Sir Arne had taken the money from the large monasteries that once flourished in this country and that the old monks had prophesied that the money would bring ill-fortune.
"Why are they sharpening knives over at Branehög?"
"Tell me, why are they sharpening such long knives over at Branehög on this very night?"
"Do you not hear the scraping and filing?
Do you not hear the hissing and squealing? "
"How can you hear them sharpening knives over at Branehög?
That estate is miles away. Pray let us finish our supper.
That very evening a banquet was held at the inn at Branehög and all the townspeople were invited.
"The old saying holds true: The closest neighbor is the last to arrive."
"I'll still see them in my mind's eye -- sharpening their knives.
God only knows what they plan. "
"Fortunately the lady vicar's vision was no more ominous than a few journeyman tanners preparing the tools of their trade."
Long after mignight, a few men left the inn at Branehög in order to saddle their horses and return home.
"Come out!
Come out!
The vicarage is on fire! "
"Last night Sir Arne and his entire household were murdered by three men... who entered the house though the smoke-hole in the roof.. men dressed in rough hides."
"Sir Arne's horse is gone... and so is the sleigh!"
The impoverished young maid, the sole survivor of the bloodbath, was taken by Torarin to come live with him and his mother in their cottage.
Torarin's cottage was situated at the highest point of the island -- -- and all the Scottish mercenaries, mariners and fishermen, locked in by the ice at Marstrand, used to pass by his cottage on their way to see if the sea had begun to cast off its blanket of ice.
Often were the times Elsalill gazed upon those who passed by.
She would ponder how blessed they were, to have something to look forward to.
She yearned for nothing on earth.
"I am not wealthy enough, Elsalill, to feed and clothe you-- so that you may remain idle and nurture your grief."
"Oh, Mother Katri! The last to be slain was my foster sister.
She pleaded for mercy, but one of the men stabbed her in the heart. "
"Had I not hidden behind a wall, I would be with my dear foster sister now!"
"I hope they are alive, so I may rip their hearts from their chests! I hope they are alive, so I may see them drawn and quartered!"
"We did not come to frighten you, good maiden, but to ask you to share your tale with us."
"We came to Marstrand to book passage to Scotland but all the fjords and sounds are frozen.
Now we while away the hours, and would be much obliged if you would share your tale with us. "
"Show the gentleman you do not lack the breeding to respond properly, Elsalill!
You were born to a higher station and are not a lowly fish wench. "
After that day, Sir Archie often ventured to Torarin's cottage to speak to Elsalill.
"God himself has sent you to me, Elsalill!"
"Elsalill, will you accompany me to Scotland... as my wife?"
"There I will build you a castle -- of wich you will be the distinguished mistress."
"Do you see the hair entwining my hand, Elsalill?
Do you see the lock of fair hair? "
"In this very same manner the hair of my foster sister was twisted around the hand of her killer."
"We frighten ourselves, unnecessarily, Elsalill.
Look, it was but a few sunbeams shining in from the window. "
"Sir Archie! Sir Archie! Why must you call the dead to mind?"
"Leave me, leave me, Sir Archie. For now my mind dwells solely upon the dead."
"Grim, my dear dog, you can no longer doubt that we travel across the sea.
Look -- a large ship is locked in the ice. "
"What do you say? Shall we call to the skipper and see if he wants to buy our fish?"
If the ice does not break, it would be impossible to set sail for Scotland.
Sir Archie wishes to discuss this matter with the skipper.
"A man like yourself, who travels everywhere and hears everything, do you know why God keeps the gates of the sea barred for so long...? Holding us all captive?"
"Once I spent a whole month in Bergen, when headwinds were so strong not a single ship could put out." The skipper... Gustav Aronson
"You see, one of the ships stuck in the harbor was carrying a man who had stolen from the church. And he would have escaped, had it not been for the raging storm."
"As soon as he was brought ashore, the weather turned beautiful and the wind grew peaceful."
"Do you know why I asked why God keeps the gates of the sea barred?"
"He requested passage to Scotland for himself and his men, but I do not like to have such ruffians aboard my vessel."
Not long afterwards, Elsalill had a peculiar dream. She thought she saw her dead foster sister standing before her...
Elsalill saw that they were in a room where the proprietress of the tavern had her maid stationed to wash dishes and tankards. Her sister seemed to beckon her to help wash.
The next day, the dream lingered and would not fade and she was irresistibly drawn to the places her foster sister had taken her in the dream.
"Rather than simply standing there, you might come in and give me a hand with the dishes."
"Drink my brother!
Sir Arne's treasure is not yet gone. "
She could not betray him.
He was dear to her heart.
She could not send him to be drawn and quartered.
She could not bear to see his hands and feet seared off.
"God bless you for coming to see me tonight, Elsalill."
"Elsalill, I have not been to see you for many days, since grave thoughts plagued me.
But when I happened upon you just now, my heart told me what I must to do -- to be released from my torment. "
"I weep, Sir Archie, for the love I bear in my heart for you is too strong."
"Soon the sea will open and ships will be able to set sail to the country from which I come.
Elsalill, won't you go with me? "
"You must go with me, Elsalill, or I will be doomed."
"Tonight I will come for you, Elsalill.
I must have your decision... tonight. "
"Why are you out here weeping?
Why did you not stay in the cellar? "
"I left because I did not wish to hear the words of the evil-doers on your premises."
"I happened, however, to hear three men talking and one said, 'Drink, my brother, Sir Arne's treasure is not yet gone.'"
"If you can witness such words, it is best not to flee.
You must go with me to the rightful authorities so they may seize the murderers and duly punish them. "
The skipper sent word to Sir Archie and his men that they may board ship this evening.
The sea has begun to open up to the west. They may even escape to Scotland before dawn.
"Go to the inn and settle things.
I must speak to Elsalill before we depart. "
"Sir Reginald and Philip have gone to the inn while Sir Archie has gone to Torarin's cottage."
"Make haste and fly, the town guards are after you!"
"They are looking for the men who murdered Sir Arne."
"Did you recognize me, Elsalill, and set them upon me?"
"They are coming for you...
"Have you considered that I will no longer have a hope of ever redeeming myself?"
"Why did you do it, Sir Archie?"
"We had been driven mad by hunger and the cold. We were senseless with drink.
I did not know what I was doing. "
"Why do you betray me... just when I trustred you most?"
"Do not fear me, Elsalill. I am again the man I once was.
I have returned to my senses... "
"... and no harm will befall you on this night either, I assure you."
Using Elsalill as a shield, Sir Archie ran for the door.
A wild wolf of the woods she had loved. An evil murderer she shielded with her own body.
And as Sir Archie took another step, the pike plunged into Elsalill's heart.
All night long the skipper paced the deck of his ketch...
Who could know what possessed the skipper to be out on such a night as this.
His crew was safely aboard ship, and so were the passengers destined for Scotland.
It was not until dawn's early light that the skipper saw the sight he was longing for.
Fjords and sounds were now open far out to sea.
But the inlet where his ship was iced in showed no channels -- it was frozen solid.
"I implore you to help me find the maid whom the Scotsmen brought to your ship last night..."
"Last night she was abducted by the men who killed Sir Arne and they brought her to your ship."
"The town guard will not venture out this far.
Not to a ship carrying a hundred soldiers of fortune. They are unwilling to engage them in battle... "
"Now I know why we have been held back... while all other ships may put to sea. It is because we have evildoers on board."
"Stay calm and obey that man.
This is the will of God. "
As soon as the criminals were brought to shore, the storm began to rage again.
And from his lofty vantage point of deck, the skipper saw a lengthy procession approach his skip.
It was the womenfolk of Marstrand, both young and old.
They were clad in mourning, and youn men carried a bier.
They had come to collect the young maiden who had loved an evildoer... and had given her life to destroy him.
... and in their wake, the tempest tore up the ice over wich they had but lately passed.
By the time they reached Marstrand with Elsalill, the gates of the sea stood open.

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE
A tale told in moving pictures under the direction of VICTOR SJÖSTRÖM
At the camera
Once there was a poor Salvation Army sister at death's door.
She'd been stricken with galloping consumption and had only held out for the space of a year.
When there was no hope left, she'd gone home to her mother.
Waiting at the foot of her bed was another Salvation Army sister who had worked alongside the sick girl.
Don't fret over those poor souls now, Sister Edit.
You've done enough for them.
Send for David Holm! "
Please don't! My daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life.
Now that she's dying, let me have her to myself.
Sister Maria, why don't you do as I ask?
Send for David Holm!
I shall go find him at once. "
You can't be serious!
Asking David Holm to attend to a dying person!
I wasn't able to find him, but Gustavsson is looking too.
He'll bring him here if it's at all possible.
Poor Mrs. Holm! "
03 p
It wouldn't do for her husband to see her if he should come here.
The evening on which these events took place was no ordinary evening.
It was New Year's Eve.
Well, we'll certainly know when it's time to toast the New Year. "
It's a spooky place to wait for midnight, here among the dead. "
You gentlemen aren't afraid of ghosts, I hope '? "
Then I'd like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour. "
"I once had a pal named Georges, who was generally a jolly fellow.
He came from a good family and had studied at Uppsala University, so he knew a bit more than the rest of us.
But a change would come over him on New Year's Eve. "
Remember that it's New Year's Eve, the last day of the year! "
Whoever dies on this eve must drive Death's carriage. "
There is an old, old carriage... "
It is no ordinary driver who holds the reins, for he's in the service of a strict master named Death.
For him, a single night is as long as 100 years on Earth.
Night and day he must Carry out his master's business.
END OF PART 1 THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 2
Wherever he goes, he's greeted with sorrow and despair. "
There is no escape. He must perform his forlorn duty. "
Though horse and carriage are always the same, the driver is not. "
The last soul to die each year- the one who passes over at the stroke of midnight- is destined to be Death's driver for the following year.
Now you know why I'm afraid of something fatal happening to me on New Year's Eve.
And the odd thing is, you see, that Georges apparently died last New Year's Eve.
Why hasn't Gustavsson arrived with David Holm? "
Come with me, David Holm!
Sister Edit is dying, and she has asked for you.
If Sister Edit wants to see you, you must go to her at once! "
David, I can't believe it's you! It is you who is to relieve me! "
You should take me to the hospital in your carriage as quickly as you can. "
No living soul rides in that carriage.
By the time I arrive, it's too late for a doctor.
You know full well that I am no longer among the living. "
But worst of all, you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime.
David, do you think I'm unaware that it's my fault you've met such an end '?
If you hadn't fallen in with me, you'd have led a good life with your wife, children, and brother.
By tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behavior.
But before you leave, a harsher punishment awaits you.
Behold your brother. While you were here, he killed a man while intoxicated, and now a long prison term awaits.
But we feel that you ought to serve the sentence in his place, since you and you alone led him astray and made him a killer.
Does this not make you want to turn from your wicked ways, David Holm? "
Only now do I realize how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one.
What about your wife and children? "
Now I know how miserable they've been, but I will turn over a new leaf.
They need never despair of me again.
END OF PART 2 THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 3
No, she's not ill. She was well enough the other day when she left.
And here I thought I'd come home to her with such joy! "
If she had gone openly, I would have understood.
But to slink off like that, to let me come home to an empty house - that was heartless!
I'll wipe those smiles off your faces.
I'll find her and show her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core, like mine has now!
I'll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife, during which your feelings of hatred and revenge grew ever stronger.
I will take you to a time a year ago, to last New Year's Eve, when you came to this town, bringing such misfortune in your wake.
A Salvation Army station had been set up here in town, and it was ready for use on New Year's Eve.
Keep your food! I just want to sleep. "
Leave it alone!
It may be full of germs, and our sterilizing oven isn't working yet.
Don't you realize, Maria, how happy I am to help the first guest God has sent us?
Please go to bed. It's been a busy day.
Let me attend to this.
Dear Jesus, let our first guest be blessed with a happy year. "
All night long she bent over the coat, never giving a thought to the germs and filth she inhaled.
By the time she went to bed, the icy chill of winter had thoroughly filled the room.
Was it you who mended my coat '? "
Would you mind calling the person who did this? "
It's a shame you went to all that trouble, miss, but I'm used to having it like this.
Before you leave, I'd like to ask you to visit me again next New Year's Eve. "
You see, I prayed that our first guest would have a good year, and I'd like to know if my prayer was answered.
Oh, I'll be here. I'll come show you God didn't give a fig for you or your twaddle.
The time has come to honor that promise before you take over here. From you she contracted the disease that put her on her deathbed, and now she awaits your visit.
You possessed all that is most wonderful, but you lost it!
You cannot avoid the torment of remorse, just as you cannot escape taking over as Death's driver for a year.
"Captive, come forth from thy prison!
Ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight, thou wilt relieve me of my office.
For a year thou wilt set souls free from the earthly realm.
END OF PART 3 THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 4
It is Death, but he has come too soon. "
You see that I'm not afraid of you.
I will gladly heed your summons, but grant me a day's reprieve, for there is someone I must talk sense into.
You do not know what terrible misfortune I have caused.
I cannot approach the Lord until I have set it right.
The person I'm waiting for is the man I love. Do you understand? The man I love!
I would grant you that reprieve if it would avail you. But you have no power over this man!
Believing he was good, you've tried to make him mend his ways, but your hopes have been dashed time and time again.
It was you who enticed him away from his home and work! You made him the drunkard he is!
Don't let yourself be dragged under! "
SALVATION ARMY RALLY
Run along and be saved, and I'll be sure to come watch! "
Why turn away so carefully?
I'm a consumptive myself, but I cough in people's faces in hopes of finishing them off.
He's merely amusing himself.
He's not as wicked as he pretends to be. "
How can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man '? "
You needn't worry about that.
I'll be leaving town in a few days. "
No, you mustn't do that! "
I would rather you stayed so I may challenge you again. "
Tempting as that may be, I still can't stay. "
You see, little missy, I'm on a journey throughout Sweden in search of someone I must find at all costs.
Who is this person you seek? "
You'll know that when I find the person in question! "
I am the one David Holm is looking for. "
I am his wife. "
I couldn't endure the life he was leading. I deserted him.
I took my children and crept away in secret.
I moved to this town, for it was so far from our old home that I never expected him to come looking for me here.
You must take him back! it's his only hope! "
"I didn't mean you must make up your mind on the spot. Only promise you'll listen to your heart, and let us talk again later.
She had gotten the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world.
Just come with me!
A surprise awaits that will make you happy.
END OF PART 4 THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 5
She hoped to replant in good soil the seed that had fallen among thorns.
And she may well have succeeded had it not been for...
The doctor says it's pneumonia.
And her resistance is poor, for she's been in ill health since last New Year's Eve.
Yes, that David Holm has been her undoing.
She worries so about the situation between him and his wife, but she mustn't know the truth.
You might at least have the heart to refrain from infecting the children! "
It wasn't so easy to run away this time! "
Haven't you had your fill of revenge, David '? "
If only I hadn't brought them together again.
His sin would be of lesser magnitude were it not for me.
You must grant me a reprieve! I cannot die yet!
I must see him turn over a new leaf! Just spare me a few minutes!
You know I love him! I've never loved him as I do today. "
Captive, ye of loving head, come forth from thy prison! "
We have no business here.
Those who are to receive her will arrive shortly.
You know, David, if I could send a message to mankind, I would like to send them a New Year's greeting.
"I would like them to dwell on a single New Year's prayer:
'Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped. '
Surely no one here is going to die! "
No, I can't go on! I can't go on! "
I'm sorry, but I must go away, and I cannot leave them behind. "
Please don't be angry with me.
it's not my fault. "
This will do, David. It will suffice for the children and myself.
"Yes, David, I see what's coming.
I'm obliged to watch. I will not shirk my duty.
You mustn't let this happen! This mustn't come to pass!
Don't let those poor, innocent creatures die!
"I have no power over the living.
Where should I turn? Should I pray to God or to Christ?
Who can tell me where to direct my plea '?
I'm a poor, miserable sinner, and I beseech the Lord of life and death!
I'm not worthy.
I've broken your every commandment.
Condemn me to eternal darkness! Let nothing remain of me!
Do what you will to me, my Lord, but spare the three of them!
"David, I see that I no longer need grieve for you!
She didn't do it yet!
Sister Edit is dead. I was at her side.
You're lying!
No one believes I want to reform.
I want to be good, but no one believes me.
It's hard to believe, David.
I can't help crying too.
Lord, please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped. "
THE END
Fighting Hearts (Four Around a Woman)
The dealers take a break.
That's the dealer, Yquem.
He has the most beautiful wife you can imagine.
Should I call his Lordship and announce him, my Lady...
No!
I want to surprise him!
Good work, isn't it?
Definitely:
The counterfeit is perfect.
That's it for today, you can go!
Hey!
What do you want?
Would you have a few marks for me?
I am in absolute poverty.
Werner Krafft?
Hmm...
Do you know a William Krafft?
William Krafft is my brother!
He used to live in the City Hotel.
I haven't seen him in five years.
I had to leave Europe, while...
I'll be very happy to help William Krafft's brother.
The jewellery dealers.
For Florence.
You know what, Krafft?
Your brother Werner was here.
I have lent him money, William, because... because I thought...
Tonight I need to get a ring, that looks just like this one!
That was Krafft.
To the City Hotel!
Mr. Yquem has had to close the office a little earlier today, Madam.
No, Madame, his Lordship is not back yet.
She is called Miss Florence Forster.
She disappeared four years ago.
Her current whereabouts are not known.
The City Hotel
It's sad that the days pass so quickly, that I have to spend them away from you!
Margot, a friend of Florence.
Tonight I would like "dinner for two"
Turtle soup?
Fried oysters?
No.
Pâté de fois gras en croûte...
With white Port Wine vintage 1864, Roast Beef with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, rémoulade sauce.
Plus, a very fiery Chambertin 1911... I do not want any dessert, but cheese... baked.
And Heidsieck champagne, "goût américain".
Mr. Krafft has just gone out.
Anyway, I need a room.
As you have no luggage, you will have to pay for the room in advance...
This will take you to old Upton.
In the meantime, you can wait here for Mr. Krafft.
You look great, my child.
But why do all this if your husband is always travelling?
Well, a beautiful woman, need not necessarily be true to her husband.
Mr Krafft left the hotel about an hour ago, but he has ordered dinner for two at 10pm.
I love my husband more than anything, Margot.
But before you got married, were you not in love with another man?
I remember there was much talk about it, but nobody knew exactly who he was.
Back then I loved my husband, but not as I love him today.
My heart belonged to another man.
And when my father gave me away to Harry against my will...
I must speak to Miss Florence again, at any cost!
It's useless to tell you the name of my future husband!
It would be pointless to go against the will of my father.
Let's go up and see if Florence has recovered from her migraine.
She is not alone!
And then?
And then?
You have made me very curious about your story and I can't wait to hear how it continues!
Is Mr. Yquem at home?
Then you better tell his wife.
This is very interesting, really interesting!
And your husband never found out what was going on?
I don't understand you, Florence!
Why do you dismiss these visitors?
I don't: Just yesterday I met a gentleman at the City Hotel, and already today...
And your husband, Margot?
My husband... My husband takes care of his business... Like yours!
What's wrong with you?
You look like a hunter, laying in wait...
You're right, and there is the target, that I'm waiting for.
I'll tell you, on the evening of my betrothal to Florence, something mysterious occurred...
Florence retired to her bedroom as she was suffering migraines; her father and I were worried about her condition, so we went up to her room.
Tell me the truth, Florence:
Do you love this man?
I can't believe that Florence has deceived me. Although I can't get the memory of that evening out of my mind!
Go to Tiergartenstr. 245, the Yquem residence.
You'll only get it back when you use your own lips!
In the Bible it is written: "Let not thy left hand know what thy right is doing"
I must discover the truth, whatever the cost!
I must be certain!
Bring me an envelope without letterhead.
I only have a penny and I beg you once again to give me a little ammount of money.
I don't know what else to do!
Please allow me a little longer as I'm waiting here for my brother.
You can count on it, he will suffer for this, the scoundrel!
I need a taxi in five minutes.
I am glad to see, my dear, that you have been enjoying yourself without me.
I will therefore no longer stand in the way of your pleasure...
How long is it from here to Tiergartenstr. 245?
You are making a big mistake, Mr. Yquem, if you continue to neglect your wife!
Consul, your Master is not coming.
We must be alone again!
For once and for all, the lady is not interested in seeing you.
That should be enough to change her mind!
Show him in.
Do what you will.
Destiny is in your hands.
You can reveal whatever you want to the world, but you will never persuade me to break the oath that I swore to my husband.
Please forgive me, but you look incredibly like an old friend...
So this letter then was also meant for my brother, Werner!
That is indeed my handwriting, but I never wrote such a letter!
Do you know anything about what happened to your brother?
Please, my lady, spare me the questions about my brother.
He will be lounging around somewhere in some far off country!
I know where Yquem lives.
He has a very beautiful wife.
A Mr. Krafft is with the lady.
Prepare Madame's baggage.
She will leave the house this very night..
You've made a mistake, Mr. Yquem.
Locked!
My poor friend!
I knew all about this and have come... to help you in your hour of need!
Women are all the same!
Forget them!
No, I will never forget Florence!
I have come, my lord, to warn you.
Your wife is in great danger!
Florence?
!
Florence is here?
Your wife doesn't want to make up with you, because you have offended her honour. She will leave this house under my protection.
In fact, Mr. Superintendent.
As soon as I realized that my ring was swapped, I rushed here to report it.
But... As far as I know, there is only one person who could have committed this crime: The elegant Mister Krafft.
Mr. Krafft recently left in a car to Tiergartenstr. 245.
No officials in uniform!
All in civilian clothes!
That's my brother. But he never told me anything about all this.
Forgive me, Florence!
All of my life and work will be devoted to you!
My thoughts are only of you!
Florence, I know that I am not worthy of you, to ask such a question, but please show me pity:
What happened on the day of our betrothal?
I don't want the shadow of suspicion to be on you!
I'll take all the blame!
Where do you think you're going, my boy? Don't you want to say
"good evening" to an old friend like me?
We caught the thief. But who killed the man whose body lies on the floor?
He's innocent!
He killed him to protect my honour.
This ruby is part of the gem collection that has been stolen from the Duke of Axminster.
How did it come to be in your possession?
What day was the theft committed?
If so, then I can prove my husband's innocence.
I can provide him with an alibi, with the help of my diary. I keep it in the winter garden.
Werner!
Thank God you are here!
Now you can confirm to my husband that I have told the truth.
I feel all the weight of my guilt.
If you left me, I would deserve it
I love you, Harry. And I will wait faithfully for you until you have paid for your misdeeds, as I have always been faithful to you.

God bless you... shepherd!
God bless you... Welcome and have a rest.
Dear me, what a man you are, square-built like Jánošík.
What?
What, shepherd?
Like who?
Begad, like Jánošík who used to live here.
Jurko Jánošík did not know what was going on at home when he was coming back to see his old parents after two years of studies and distress.
Little bread, much work!
God bless you...
I am exhausted after the long journey.
Could I have some water?
Enjoy it.
To your health!
Oh, this is our neighbour Anka.
Yes, Anka!
Pišta.
It happened two years ago.
Easy, easy. The kiss is hot you could burn your moustache.
Do not leave yet!
Oh no!
Through the scarf only!
Well-known cottages.
Jánošík's friend and protector.
I have not seen my father and mother yet. How are they?
Are they healthy?
Dear father! Where is mom?
Mom, my dear mom!
The old Jánošík was not at work again!
My wife died.
She would not have jumped out of the coffin even if you came to work.
Fifty strokes with a stick!
Go and tell Jánošík they are beating his father.
How can you? You, you!
It is good the monk is here, we can save on the funeral.
And he was beaten so badly that he died on the same day.
At the village.
To work!
To work!
Think it over and you will never have to work for your lords.
They chase him, so Jánošík hides in a cave.
Oh, mother, mother dear, A long way from here. I cry longing for you Want to be near.
Bless you.
Thank you, Anka.
No!
Do not leave!
I thought there was nobody to look after my parents' graves.
But you...
Annie, you are an angel!
No, Annie, I shall not become a priest.
The bloody nobs make it impossible.
You cannot run away this time!
We shall catch him and earn a hundred ducats as a reward.
An uninvited witness.
Well, you can fight pretty well, father.
I am not a priest yet and probably shall never be one.
This dog and Šándor took me everything and chased me like an animal.
Is it you, Jánošík from Terchová?
Is it really you?
Welcome!
I am Hrajnoha, the bandits' captain.
We nearly forgot about that one.
Pay a fine.
Hey, there's a grove up the way. There's a path up the way. My father was a good fellow.
Fellows!
Here
- Jánošík - our new companion - let him be our captain!
Long live Jánošík!
Long live our new captain!
Dear friends! I should have been a priest but Satan crossed my plans.
Do you want me to be your captain?
Well then, I accept.
I promise to be your fair leader!
As so far, we shall go on protecting the serfs.
We will help them in all possible ways.
Our will - our strength.
Let the serfs benefit from all our doings!
The lords take us everything - our properties, freedom, lives - we shall not spare them!
But remember, we shall not kill anybody!
Death shall not change anybody.
Long live Jánošík!
Long live our captain!
The walls in the Count Šándor's mansion were the silent witnesses of the gentry's wild life.
Not every squire is a good squire.
The Hungarian squire is the best!
In the neighbouring domain.
Visitors are coming.
His nobility
- Baron Révay.
Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
Well, Your Nobility, will you pay your debt at last?
Of course I will!
Yes, I was just checking how much I got.
How many times shall I mention my 5.OOO guldens?
I will put you up for public auction!
Is it still the old wine?
Lo! What wine?
Well, will you sell me a bushel?
To sell?
It will be a present from me, sir!
Oh no, it would be much waste, I shall buy it.
Believe me, sir, upon my squire word, if the crop was in the barns I would pay you immediately. But where to get money now?
And what about the peasants?
Could they not pay your debt?
What do you mean?
Well, it is simple.
Each peasant will pay 5O pennies. Those who do not have the money will pay in produce.
The Jew will buy them and you will get money!
Well, sir, tell my servant not to get the horses until tomorrow.
Hereby we announce that our venerable lord and owner Count Šándor orders his serfs to pay 5O pennies.
Those who have no money, will pay the tax in goods.
Those who refuse will be beaten and put in the stocks!
Give me back my pots!
I have nothing to pay the tax with.
I could not pay you for your work.
Well, I shall mend them gratis.
After a short while.
Really cheap.
Did he pay?
I am coming to collect the tax in the afternoon.
It was very good advice, indeed.
We are even now.
You can use my advice also next time.
Fellows, I must go down to the village.
And you, Hrajnoha, Take care of Baron Révay!
The serf cannot rest even on Sunday.
When will a squire keep his word?
The daughter is alone, isn't she?
You will not work hard in this cabin any more, you will come with me to my manor-house.
You must be sensible, you will be well in the manor-house.
Oh, you are like a scared little animal. Do not be so stubborn. You will soon forget about that bandit!
Here he is, the bandit!
Well, so this is the bandit nest, isn't it?
But you shall not escape this time!
You coward!
Well, you will pay for those words!
At the father's protection.
Father, help me. Rescue Annie from Šándor!
Dear son, what path did you take?
Oh, Father, do not condemn me. You know the soul of the suffering serfs.
Oh, mercy!
Be a father to my Anka!
Jánošík took care of the poor serfs, helped them together with the local priest and other secret friends.
Evening at the parish house.
What Šándor's people took, cannot be given back.
Here, Jánošík is sending you some ducats for the damage.
Meeting at the county administrator's place.
Is the Hungarian squire not the master and lord of his peasants any more?
Should we let these dirty bandits order us what to do and want not to do?
Well, do you know what happened at the last county ball?
Before midnight... When everybody was having a good time...
You rob from the serfs, I rob from you.
And each of your sins will be punished.
You let my father be beaten to death!
You took everything from me!
Remember, you shall not escape my revenge!
And we should take this?
This is not a good order!
Gentlemen, I promise you to clear your county of this group of bandits.
Here, Commissioner will give you soldiers.
The trap is ready.
Is his lover hiding at the parish?
Where has the bandit's lover gone?
And you, foolish old man, give the bandits' money to peasants?
Your master will throw you out of the parish.
I have resigned myself to anything.
Well, old man, is there some wine for your guest?
Hey, old woman!
Has some bandit fallen in love with you yet?
What brought you here? What can I do for you?
I came to confess.
But this time you will confess to me!
Does the bandit come here often?
He does not.
Why do you not bring the girl here?
What for?
What for?
So she can tell me where the bandit is.
I do not know.
You know where he is, too.
Tell me, you old fool!
Don't you know it?
You!
Jánošík!
For goodness sake, save yourself! Soldiers!
Go away!
Away!
Come on, Mišo! Come on!
Let the house shake!
While at the farm...
Look out, fellows!
Prepare your pistols, get ready and follow me!
No, Jánošík!
We must not lose you!
I am the first to go.
In the name of His Majesty, surrender, Jánošík!
Eternal peace.
The verdict.
As the accused and his, already punished, companions, are found guilty, having been accused of many felonies:
Arson, robbery and even murder, he is sentenced to death! So as to warn others, the punishment differs from others and Jánošík is sentenced to be hung by his left rib on a hook and quartered after his death!
Let the sentence be carried out without delay!
Such was the death of Jánošík, the first fighter for freedom of the Slovak people.
Thank you, shepherd.
Take care!
THE END
Stop it!
Enough!
I will hear no more!
It's disgusting, appalling!
But yet... I who thought it up, hatched it out in nights, in nights... ah!
You do not know!
For you it's a game spicing what else life offers you willingly.
But to me!
A thirsty one!
One who is at the point of pining away... mocked, harassed, abused by tortures which...
That nature gave me, together with this face and this hump, such feelings, such greed... I beg you, quiet!
The guardians of order are on watch and full of ambition.
Behind the doors the bribed servants are lurking,
- in the gardens henchmen are hiding.
- You exaggerate, my friend.
Scruples too profound are really out of place.
The fact that we are not satisfied with peasant girls and maidens, with merchants' daughters and hussies, that we choose the finest and prettiest, is a proof of our taste.
What was the watchword you gave us some weeks ago?
"" Beauty be prey of the strong. ""
"" All splendour of the world succumb to the power of mind, ""
"" and the conqueror's glory shine brighter ""
"" and penetrate deeper, more painfully into the souls ""
"" than the brilliance which merely dazzles the eye. ""
- lt's true!
- Thus you spoke.
- And since then...
- What you created you shun.
You even avoid us!
None of the clandestine festivities has welcomed you!
Just because a few fathers wring their hands and a few mothers cry heart-rendingly!
Just don't think the beauties themselves are angry with us.
Yesterday Alissa, the little Jewess, you should have seen her face!
And the amazing daughter of Biparetto the poet, really, she was lovely!
We snatch them from their lovers' arms heavy with everyday burdens!
The misunderstood woman weeps not for the husband inexperienced in love!
Out of cramped rooms into wide, mystic spaces...
All fairy tales come to life, all dreams of secret nights...
Dreams of the Orient, they come true!
What no one admits and everyone longs for suddenly is reality!
Quite so, quite so... lt is convincing.
But in one point, pardon me, for me it's not quite right.
You always only speak about yourself who are good-looking and endowed with charm, and you forget me, the cripple.
If he came to the festivities, as you demand, he would spoil them... and instead of lust horror would pave its way.
My friend, it seems to me that you overrate enormously the way women feel about beauty.
There were spring nights.
Through open windows it came in, dancing.
All sensuous magic, scent of flowers, heavy and inebriating.
And I had to leave, tossed by a fever, out into lonely lanes.
And I searched for a strumpet, a really depraved one.
Spoke to her, offered her gold, a lot of gold, still I felt like the beggar asking for alms.
By the light of the street lamp she looked me up and down with eyes... a smile...
so humiliating that my blood ran cold.
There the gold had an effect!
On coloured lips its blaze reflected my misery's dreadful need.
Lascivious words promised agreement, but I didn't have the strength to spit at myself and to desecrate the spring night.
My lord, the notary.
- For goodness, Alviano...
- You're capable of...
What's the notary supposed to do?
Don't worry!
Would you ask him to be patient for a short time.
What for?
What's your plan?
I forgot to confide it to you.
My island Elysium, with all its buildings, fountains and resplendent gardens, with all its miracles of art unheard of and rare treasures of generous nature,
as a donation I left it for perpetuity to the city.
You're out of your senses!
You don't know what you're doing!
Your life's work!
You spent half your fortune on it; you wasted it, thoughtlessly.
Tomorrow evening, after dusk, in the presence of the Senate and the PodestÁ, I'll officially announce it
to the people.
Gentlemen, you are invited.
But, for goodness, do you forget... I considered everything.
You hand us over!
The access to the underground hall... lf you fear discovery, avoid it from now on.
But excuse me now.
I await the town councillors and, together with the notary, I must lay down the wording and articles of the donation.
- Hello!
Vitelozzo!
- l am late.
- We see!
- And out of breath!
My friends...
What's up?
I am bewildered!
Sancta Maria, what happened?
- Deeply moved...
- Oh, God!
Unhappy one!
... by such beauty!
- Ah!
- l thought so!
- A woman!
- Of course!
- No!
- A goddess.
- An angel.
- A flower.
- We know this.
- Please, be quiet!
Where did you see this beauty?
I came past the town hall when the city elders drove up in their coaches for some festivity.
Maybe there is... what do you think... ln one of them, listen...
My greetings, gentlemen, and thanks that my modest home has been honoured by such distinguished guests.
Your modest home?
O noble Sir Salvago, you are too unassuming.
The splendour of the rooms we walked through is unequalled in all of Genoa.
Your compliment makes me happy.
But please permit:
here are my friends, the best of Genoa's aristocracy. You will recognize the names of illustrious descents.
This is my only child, my beloved daughter Carlotta.
I am afraid, sir, maybe you find her too liberal-minded.
She has, to my regret, a low opinion of social rules.
The admiration of your generosity and a very special request to you, she... I bid you welcome and, if I had the privilege to fulfil the young lady's desire, I would call myself lucky!
But now, if you allow, we, delegated from the Senate,
want to bring to you the gratitude and the joyful amazement of the noble assembly.
Your document announces a donation to us, so great and important, so unexpected and seldom these days.
It's hard for the citizen to preserve his paltry possessions.
Gold he arduously worked for runs through his fingers like water, and yet... taxes increase even more.
We endured it, mostly patiently and grumbling but rarely, since the treasure of our family's sanctity remained to us and the belief in our Madonna.
But there it breaks in like a wolf into the flock and robs us of our wives and kidnaps our daughters and without defence, without help...
But forgive me, sir, to complain to you about our sorrows was really not our delegation's intention.
For the first ray of light, after scared days, we have to thank you!
The island's auspicious name, for us it augurs well.
Do you remember, Signorina, a rider this morning, his black horse took fright at the sight of the coaches.
The Duke Adorno... right of objection...
we're dependent...
What could he object...
The rider looked into two sparkling eyes and, confused by them, he forgot to rein in the horse and nearly made an unwilling bow to the beauty, so that was you?
- l was very amused.
- You are cruel.
And if, by falling off his horse, an arm or leg were broken... A glance from my eyes, isn't it worth it for you?
I'd gladly give my life for you, yet...
And if this were just what I wanted?
You are so great, so mighty and strong, so far above me... I have to stretch myself, look, just to look into your eyes, oh, so sure of victory.
And I'd like to see you small and low and poor, far beneath me, reachable to my feet...
The dead are poor.
But dead and mute.
I love the soul that fights and struggles, that sacrifices itself and suffers for love's reward.
If you're dead one day, what use is my love to you then?
Have you gone mad, young lady!
The answer... I will think about it
and I will answer you tomorrow.
Wait, Vitelozzo!
Why in such a hurry?
- Listen!
- We're in danger!
He is to hand us over to those lousy citizens!
- The access to the underground hall!
- By Madonna,
- We must stop it!
- let me go!
Talk to Adorno!
Do what you want, but leave me out of it!
- But you... one word!
- l know nothing, I want nothing, I am in love, I love...
Do you hear?
The plague upon you!
That's settled then: you'll give us one more day.
The Senate will request the Duke's permission first.
And tonight you will be my guest.
As now you are mine.
I beg my noble guests not to disdain my invitation, just a simple meal.
Signorina, your arm!
You're highly amusing,
- Sir Alviano, really...
- Do you feel better then?
I was scared; suddenly you reached for your heart
- Ah, little one, I am as fit as a fiddle.
But did my father not tell you about a request?
Yes, indeed.
So quickly you forget such important things?
- No, but...
- Well, you see... in front of the people it wouldn't have worked!
And as all my winks, my furtive signs, my asking whether you possessed a painting or a rare sculpture to show me, as all this didn't help I had the idea...
You must take me for a dolt, ignorant of life, naive and silly.
Yet I rarely have the pleasure to associate with pretty women... that's why that... do you understand?
I understand.
But listen.
I paint.
Yes, really. Don't look so amazed.
I do paintings.
Animals and men, trees and lakes... the sky, the light... but I like best painting souls.
And you can?
I mean, do you succeed in painting souls?
I don't know whether I can, and if I fail then it seems to me it's not always my fault.
You hardly find models.
Only once it seemed to be successful.
The picture appeared, so wondrously fine.
Just an ugly shadow between chin and mouth...
Look there... and ponder and try as I would, it appeared again and again.
Already I thought it gone and banished for ever. There, all of a sudden, insidiously it crept out of the brushes and took root!
This picture I gave up.
A long time I didn't attempt anything.
But you...
You I'd love to paint.
Me?
Damn it, are you out of your wits?
I see!
It had to happen.
I really thought you took me seriously, you were different from the others, the snakes with gentle faces, with enticing eyes and hearts like devils.
But just now I've seen it: the same look.
Oh, goodness, collect yourself!
Perhaps as a fool in a painting among pretty men and women, an effective contrast, with a fool's cap, the hump would fit in quite well, for the people to jeer at for all time!
Hush now!
Don't forget that you are speaking to a lady.
You do me wrong.
Hear me out.
Where the town widens and the view opens on to the countryside,
there I have a cottage for a studio.
Early in the morning, the lanes and squares still deserted and empty, when the wan morning light is lapping around the canvas, colourless and soft,
then to me it seems the right time for work.
A road goes past my cottage, lined by tall cypresses.
You know it well.
You often walked on it,
shy and bowed down, lost in thought...
Suddenly suspiciously watching the windows, whose curtains hide the observer.
But you did not see her.
Then arose, purple glowing, veils shimmering in a thousand colourings, shining mists like eerie heralds came along, announcing its approach: the sun...
And a second miracle took place:
I saw the small, wretched wanderer raise his head.
Every muscle tensed up in the frail body.
The arms raised up into the sky.
Thus he walked into the glare, towards the sun.
And I saw him becoming taller and taller, the figure was growing enormously.
My heart was beating.
Thus I was painting you, Signor Alviano.
Thus I was painting your figure:
walking towards the sun.
But still I need the face and still I need the drunken eye
in which all beauty will be reflected.
I am ashamed... I don't know... pardon me... I have never felt like this in my life!
Will you come to my studio so that I can complete the painting?
I'll be glad to come.
He's playing cat and mouse with us.
He has become far too mighty, the noble sir!
His last triumph over Branciforte went to his head.
The people have spoilt him.
- After all, they are indebted to him.
- They pay him.
A noble mercenary, nothing more.
- How are things going?
- He didn't say.
Not for and against.
On the one hand it would be welcome for the people of Genoa, on the other hand the aristocracy would regret if it were to lose a valuable property.
His heart would beat for the people, would decide in its favour.
But fairness and consideration for his friends would call him for caution, he ought to think it over and discuss it and similar catchphrases.
With all his heart he envies us the donation.
He detests the whole affair.
The man of the day is Alviano Salvago!
The whole town is praising his name.
My daughter Carlotta, who is not easily conquered, spoke of him often, imagining his character.
Now he has taken her by storm.
Duke Adorno ought to be wary!
He ought to be wary, Duke Adorno!
Do you hear it?
- This is the public mood.
- Does the mob frighten you?
You spoke differently yesterday.
Well, yesterday...
Don't remind me!
Do you speak to your friend like this?
Excuse me.
But isn't it enough that I disdain myself?
is your mockery supposed to turn a knife in my wounds and my friends' laughter to drive me mad?
What ails you, Tamare?
I do not recognize you.
The most brilliant gentleman of my court, like nobody else honoured,
beloved, idolized by the women, constantly in the mood for the most incredible pranks.
There are people who only see the light and darkness is alien to them.
I was one of that kind.
Life seemed to me a source of constant joy from which I drank with thirsty gulps, careless, without thinking.
When I stretched out my hand, I held the rose, drew in its fragrance and pulled the petals off.
When I dropped to the ground, I fell softly on moss, thorns shunned me as well as sharp stones.
When a friend poured out his heart to me I heard him perfectly well, but I did not understand him.
And now I have experienced at once all torment of hell, humiliation and disgrace.
Explain yourself.
Beautiful as the daylight, but not of equal rank with me...
- a bourgeois child.
- Well.
And then?
When I spoke to her the first time I think I did not understand her right.
She asked for a sacrifice as a pledge of my love.
But what she desired...
a lot of nonsense, madness, born at that moment I tried to understand, to interpret following the rules of courtly manners.
After a night of battling I thought I'd found it and mounted my horse, free and proud like a god, my filled heart puffed up with noble feelings.
And I rode through the town and, lost in dreams, I drew up the courting and I saw the beauty flush happily, stunned and moved by the honour!
A Count Andrae Vitelozzo Tamare offers heart and hand...
You are really mad.
Be patient, Duke!
When I stood before her, like the first time, at once I fell in despair.
The strange look in her eyes, her cool and amazed smile confused me.
But to guard timid heart I behaved haughtily, arrogant and gruffly, I talked about the sacrifice I would make for her more evil than self-mutilation and death...
And since I finally got her "" No "", I completely lost the remnants of my senses.
I threw myself at her feet, about my possessions I wildly talked gibberish.
Clasping her knees I implored her for forgiveness and mercy!
Tamare, pull yourself together.
Do you hear, Vitelozzo?
Who is this woman?
The PodestÁ's daughter, Carlotta.
Ah!
An important painter once mentioned her name to me as that of a rare talent.
I'd like to warn you for some reasons, but I know the futility of such an action and how he who warns is detested by him who loves unfortunately.
That's why I prefer helping you instead of giving advice to you.
Ah, if you could... I will court for you.
You don't know this woman.
But I know women.
That's why I hope for you.
But promise me one thing:
if I bring back a bad message, if I return with empty hands, then do not rage against yourself and me, be strong, don't despair, shake it off and forget this woman!
Listen, Duke, I want to forget her.
I want to forget her.
But first she has to be mine.
Not until I have drunk the breath of her mouth and my hands are soaked with the scent of her hair, not until this woman, if she refuses to be my wife, has been my whore!
That'll stir up bad feelings!
We are bound by law and order like everybody else.
Don't forget.
My friends sent me to appeal to you:
you may prevent that Alviano's island, Elysium,
- pass into the town's possession.
- Damn it, what has Salvago, what has the island to do with your heinous intrigues?
On that island an artificial grotto makes wonderful rooms accessible,
especially created for love's celebrations.
When you enter the grotto, a blue light dazzles your eyes.
Heavy fragrances confuse your senses, crimson flames, flaring up like visions, distant music and soft singing lure you deeper and deeper.
A narrow path leads to the cave's entrance, hidden by shrubs of roses.
But if someone discovers the grotto's secret then we are lost.
Does Salvago know about your doing?
Salvago, ha ha!
A whim of nature, if you like, a strange caprice.
Genoa's ugliest man is the creator of this adventure,
of this materialized idea of beauty.
And he himself...
He himself keeps away.
Maybe he has regrets.
But I don't understand it.
The torches' glow gilds everything.
In the orgy's frenzy ugliness becomes beautiful, and beauty becomes ugly.
The contrasts vanish in the rapture!
And this fool Salvago, after he cultivated on his land blooms of vice and poisonous plants of sin... he gives up the land and himself and you?
He warned us.
Yet he did not consider how difficult it is to control passion, once it is unbridled.
That is my curse: your immoderation.
Your unbridled passion compels me to actions I condemn!
I will rescue what can still be rescued.
I will keep my promise to you because your love keeps you from the company of miscreants and because of our friendship since youth.
Beware, Vitelozzo, you have been warned of violence.
Salvago ought to restrain his urge for donation for a long time.
This benefactor of people, he will obey, or woe to him and woe to you all!
Our times are full of strange things.
I knew a woman, like me she learned to paint at the Antwerp School, she painted hands.
Fine, slim hands with delicate blue-veined structures, rough and strong fists of men,
a woman's hand with rings, voluptuous and tender, with nails, pointed and rosy, flashing like drops of pale blood.
There I saw a hand which dug its nails in healthy flesh and another plucked with gentle fingers a twig, growing out of green bushes.
But the oddest thing was one painting:
a hand, waxen and pale, pale as death, with weird long and skinny fingers,
it was grasping something you could not see.
Only a faint reddish gleam penetrated the eerie fingers, but this glow was like a silent dirge,
like a suppressed moaning cry, like a scream, restrained and in mortal fear,
like a restrained cry for release...
But, the painting's meaning?
The poor one probably never felt what inspires artists to great works:
the happiness of love or the ardent desire for it.
She may have been anxious that once on her path of life she might encounter an event, some sensuously intoxicating charm to which she would surrender.
How strange, fear of happiness?
The driving force of this poor life was greed for fame and the fountain from which it was nourished was pain.
Not mentally, a physical pain.
Your hand, Signorina, is not as steady as your voice, if you want to paint...
No.
You are wrong!
My hand is quite steady and the story soon comes to an end.
My friend suffered from her heart since her youth.
All too often it would beat too passionately and sometimes she felt as if a merciless hand clutched at the twitching thing and squeezed it, dreadful and aching,
so that it may come to rest!
This hand, this cruel hand
she painted and her pain, too.
Even though you deny it, you are deeply moved, so it really touched you?
I loved her...
So she died?
I think she is still alive.
Tell me of your youth or why you are so gloomy and in such a bad mood today... or rather why your eyes so fearfully evade mine.
What have I done? Are you angry with me?
Signorina Carlotta, if this is nothing but a game for you, the pleasure of playing around or even worse, then you are, despite your sweet face and your voice which sounds like a message from heaven,
Why should I who am so good to you be as vicious and evil as you describe me?
I implore you, don't be angry with me!
Just have some patience with me!
I don't understand: it is like a dream and I fear...
No, do not fear!
You are a man and totally without any self-confidence.
is it so unthinkable that a woman should find herself in love and friendship for you?
Ha ha!
The old story!
But the way you look, with eyes whose glow alone is promise...
And when your mouth smiles I feel as if on earth there were nothing that is named "" friendship "", as if this word, this miserable word, were an absurdity, a lie and disgrace!
And if it were more...
I do not say it is...
Should there be on this earth among millions of beating hearts not to be found one that strives for you in love?
For me... me who hates himself, who flees from himself, who banished the mirrors out of his rooms!
A fool you are!
Who like nobody else clings to that which slips away like a day in May:
this bit of beauty which leaves us women when the first furrow is on its way!
We are scarcely conscious of spring, when buds turn to fruit.
The leaves wither and fall.
And this should be the one thing?
Did you never go out on a sunny day, gloomy and sad, without knowing why?
And not even the most outstanding person, not the most flourishing tree could rescue you from your anxiety.
And some other time, on rainy days, did it not make you happy, even overjoyed, to see an old, lonely man, wrinkled and ugly, who went on his way and looked at you with naive eyes?
But if, on a glorious day, in a bed of the loveliest flowers, you were to find a grim monster which put you in a bad mood?
But I notice one thing:
you evade me, once with looks, now with words.
But I have to tell you.
Carlotta, consider...
You shall know that I love you.
Carlotta!
For God's sake, Signor, how you do stare at me!
There, take my hands, kiss them quickly!
But let me go on working.
I need your eyes for my painting.
Thus they are right for me.
Carlotta!
Beloved!
I beg you, do not speak.
Just look at me just straight, look deeply into my eyes and think about beautiful things, that I am your sun that chases away all darkness from your life with streaming light.
For God's sake, Carlotta, I must at your feet.
I am happy beyond words.
I beg you, stay.
Just look at me and consider that never again will you be lonely and unloved despite your ugliness.
See how calmly I say the word which tormented you for so long.
Now it's over.
Since it's a word... and a concept...
Nothing more.
But you must be good to me, Alviano, and tender, my dear!
Because I am quite a fragile toy.
Carlotta!
That's it, it's finished.
Now come and hold me.
I am exhausted, yet you must...
For all saints' sake...
Dear, what happens to you?
You sweet, poor one...
You loveliest one!
You gave life to me, you gave back to me the belief in God and mankind.
I want to consecrate to you all I have.
I want to spread myself out beneath your feet.
I want to be infinitely good to you and tender.
Lady!
Duke Adorno!
The Duke, what on earth can he want?
Please tell him to wait.
Since yesterday I have been hearing voices everywhere.
Singing in the air and murmuring in the bushes...
Carlotta's silvery laugh a while ago, but probably it was a delusion.
Ah, sir, how changed and happy I am since the day you first entered my house.
Your daughter, so soon to be my wife, how beautiful beyond words she is, so full of sincere kindness.
But you are reserved.
What troubles you, PodestÁ?
I am bewildered and dazzled.
What you have just shown me, it is incredible that the brain of a single man should have thought up this realm of magic!
Many people helped me.
The artists were active.
I only contributed the yearning.
- But where is Carlotta?
- Come on, let us look for her.
Did you not hear?
They are looking for you, Carlotta, and you hide yourself in the shadows. Then you run away from your fiancé?
Don't think badly of me, Duke. After all I don't know what happens to me.
Yesterday when I answered you "" No "" for Count Vitelozzo I felt proud and secure, grand and joyful.
But yet, since I finished the painting, which pleased you so much,
the portrait of Alviano,
it seems to me as if something had grown weary within me, as if my love were no longer the same.
Not poorer, don't get me wrong.
But as though now he had given me his all, his everything and as though I had nothing... nothing more to expect.
And further... yet I don't know if a woman's conflicting feelings are of interest to you or whether they provoke your scorn, Duke?
Pray, trust me, how true and authentic you are,
Signorina!
I came to this island full of secret fear.
As if I had drunk wine, heavy and mixed with enchanting herbs, or that strange drink, brewed with the blood from the heart of a love-stricken virgin!
It is the dreadful spell of beauty, normally bound, half-concealed from the senses and now raging, exposed to the daylight and lecherous eyes like a beautiful woman's limbs, shyly covered in the years of desire,
suddenly enjoying nakedness, displaying its charms for the rejoicing eyes of the loving youth!
O Duke, you who know life and women, you sinned against Alviano, but he sinned even more against himself, because when I saw him, there, with my father, in all this splendour he created through the burning power of his mind,
when I saw him, the poorest, who himself tore the kind-hearted veils in which mercy wraps us as well as the strange power which tames the senses, then I remembered the saying of this unhappy one in his sole joyful hour:
"" But if, on a glorious day, ""
"" in a bed of the loveliest flowers, ""
"" you were to find a grim monster... ""
- For God's sake, young lady...
- Let me go, Duke!
Calm down then; the sole joyful hour, you said it yourself, he owes to you.
This may console you.
You shall not console me.
I do not want any mercy.
Torture and hatred I do deserve, desperation and death!
So listen to one last thing.
He was not worthy and did not deserve your love.
He is not the noble man you think he is.
He is obsessed by evil desire and today it befalls him... I won't hear anything.
You try to defame him, but he is noble and sublime and I am miserable and depraved.
I hate myself and the world and you.
Only the night... this very night I love and its shadows.
Then God may have mercy upon you.
Come now, I'll take you to your father.
Go, go!
But leave me here!
Ah, what a night!
What a glowing summer night!
I want to crawl into its dark light, dive into its shining darkness!
With stars I'll dance the summer night's dance, but with goblins I'll sleep in the bushes.
Ah, what a night!
What a glowing summer night!
Ah, what a night!
What a glowing summer night!
With stars I'll dance the summer night's dance, but with goblins I'll sleep in the bushes.
Ah, what a night!
What a glowing summer night!
Where is my bride?
Has no one seen Carlotta?
Why are you fleeing from me?
No, I am not fleeing from you.
You know me then?
I don't know who you are.
But if it were someone who loves you, beauty?
You love me?
Well then.
But let me peep at your face to see whether your eyes are bright or dull.
Are you Alviano?
No, you aren't.
Of nice build, a handsome man.
O beautiful Carlotta, how strangely you speak!
Strangely, my love?
Give me your hand, ah, it's soft and hot, and it feels pleasant.
Do you feel my heart beating passionately!
For you, my dear! For you!
But listen, young man, you hold it gently with your soft hands, you must not torment it, you clasp it, gently and softly.
- The night is short, dawn is close!
Come on, let us hurry!
- Sweet is the night,
- Feel my heart beating.
- Let us hurry, the night is short, dawn is close!
- For you!
- For you!
I hear her voice!
It resounds to me from heights and chasms a thousand times!
Singing from the air, a mocking song from the depths of hell!
Her figure dances before me, peers out of bushes, here and there her dress glitters like a will-o '-the-wisp she rushes me, uphill, downhill, into the air, into the swamps... and yet I held her, after all she was mine!
Or was she not?
- Vivat Alviano Salvago!
- He gave us joy!
Bearer of beauty!
Father of the people!
What do you want?
Be silent!
I am not a king.
A fool, a cripple!
A beggar, a monster!
Where is my bride?
Bring her to me!
I will be grateful.
I'll give you all my worldly goods.
Then I will be prince, king, god!
But give me Carlotta!
I will be grateful!
Then I will be prince, king, god!
Vivat Alviano, Apollo!
The Muses' friend!
Crown the king!
Where is the crown, the crown of rosaries?
This people's friend, lift him up!
Crown him with roses!
Cheers for Alviano!
Stop it, no, stop it...
Stop it, people of Genoa!
Stop it, beguiled people!
Madmen you are!
You crown the one who kidnapped your daughters, who seduced and abused your children, perhaps killed!
What is this?
What does he mean?
The Council of Eight!
Dreadful!
- He?
- Alviano?
!
- Don't believe him!
- l see!
- The Alberghi.
- The sly dogs!
- lt's done cleverly!
- These envious persons!
- Slander!
- Cheers for Alviano!
Be quiet!
Silence!
Listen to the Council of Eight!
Through the Holy Council of Eight, I, Duke Adorno, the people's protector and loyal friend, bring a charge against the knight Alviano Salvago.
I accuse him of kidnapping girls, of seduction and rape, committed against virgins, of procuring
- and encouragement to the same.
- Was there not a scream?
Did you not hear a scream?
By virtue of our power as judges and keepers of the law we extend the charge against the knight Alviano Salvago and accuse him who is possessed by the Evil One, who became a slave of Satan and wicked demons,
of having bewitched the people.
We cast a ban on the island Elysium.
It shall be devastated by fire, as a breeding ground of vices and devilish sin.
Sir Salvago, you...
You see, it comes down to this!
- They rob us!
- They grudge us the joy!
Cursed thieves!
Beasts!
- Down with Adorno!
- Death to the Alberghi!
Kill the bastards!
- lt's all a lie!
- Defend yourself!
- Alviano, speak!
- We believe you!
We stand by you!
Alviano, speak!
We protect you!
For you!
- Don't you hear it?
Music...
- Feel my heart beating.
The night is short, dawn is close.
Cymbals, flutes, harps... and wild singing?
You see, he is obsessed, the demon speaks through him!
Alviano, listen, it's a matter of life and death.
They will interrogate him under torture.
Lead him away!
Stop!
Do not touch him!
Him who is silent we trust more than you who speak.
He did us good.
If you want to arrest him, give us proof!
Proof!
Bring along that woman.
Take your veil off, Ginevra!
Ginevra Scotti!
For God's sake, let me go!
Speak frankly and without reserve, Ginevra Scotti.
Where were you hidden, before you fled to Duke Adorno, seeking help?
In the house of Alviano Salvago.
- Hear!
- Hear this!
- Silence!
Who is it?
- Hear this!
What are you waiting for?
Why don't you move?
Old man, have mercy and let me go!
I begin to realize, terribly clearly...
Speak frankly and without reserve, Signorina Scotti.
Who robbed you of freedom and honour?
A nobleman who called himself Menaldo Negroni.
- Ah!
The Alberghi!
- Look!
- Listen!
Yet, what about Salvago?
Spit out the truth!
Old man, she is in danger, I see the correlation before me!
The head of this gang of wild fellows, of noble robbers, is Alviano Salvago.
All this was brought before the Duke by Count Vitelozzo Tamare.
Who spoke the name?
Who snatched it from my brain?
It's him!
He kidnapped her.
He was after her.
He courted her. I know it, know it...
Are you raving?
Count Vitelozzo kidnapped Ginevra?
Who talks about Ginevra?
Who is she?
I don't know anything about her!
Carlotta!
You cur!
You rake!
You animal!
If I had hold of you, I'd tear you to pieces, you beast!
Come on, I'll lead you.
Do you see the blue light up there?
Do you hear?
Listen!
is this not music?
Wild and lascivious, screams and rejoicing...
People of Genoa!
I will lead you to your dishonoured daughters!
To my poor, lost bride!
Then I'll justify myself to you and you shall judge.
But woe to the others!
Woe!
Death upon them!
You lie!
You're wrong. I say the truth.
Listen, it might well be that she will not wake up any more,
that she will pass away into the other world.
And see, for me it meant so much.
I had nothing else.
In my whole life this woman was the only great, the only wonderful thing.
Realize, if you say to me:
"" l kidnapped her, I took her by force, ""
"" l couldn't do otherwise because I loved her... "", then I must hate you, I must curse you since you took from a miserable one like me what he possessed, and you destroyed it.
But deep within me would still persist something, understand me, something like an aching consolation.
But if you say to me:
"" She gave herself to me, ""
"" she, Carlotta, willingly, in love, ""
"" and she was happy, "" yes, precisely, you said "" happy "",
then, then... then I had nothing, well, then you took nothing from me, then I am once again as miserable... just as miserable as I was...
Thrown back into nothingness...
Even if you kill me, I know nothing else to tell you.
Only one thing:
this woman became a slave to me from the first day I saw her, Alviano, according to your saying once,
"" Beauty be prey of the strong. ""
You fancied yourself strong, for one hour, but you were not.
Pleasure presented itself to you, there you avoided it, trembling and cowardly.
You only saw the darkness, the shadows, danger and sin.
Too bitterly branded for life you became by fate broken-winged, inhibited, self-conscious.
For your kind the precious flower is only living in dreams, but when she blossoms garishly and seducing by day it seems a dream to you, a vision, a nocturnal spectre.
For did not, Alviano, as you said, Carlotta also give herself to you?
Why did you not take her?
Because, because...
You devil, do not request that, before you go to hell, I reveal for all the world to see a crime
so ghastly...
Because I look into depths you can't even imagine, since I am a man and you?
I don't know which one of us is looking deeper.
I don't know what is to be rated higher:
a joyless life, a gradually wasting away or a death in rapture and transfiguration, in passionate embrace a blissful dying!
What happens to me?
Your words' meaning, but this is not possible... Her lips asked for mercy, incoherently they stammered the old song of fearful resistance.
But her eyes begged for lust.
An agonizing confession escaped from her lips, fear and horror...
But from her eyes, boundless, wild, sparks of roused desire were flashing.
At last it forced its way:
greater than you, she made herself free.
The sparkling dance of her laughing eyes was joined by the inebriate song of her lips:
"" Grant death, "" her eyes rejoiced,
- "" Grant happiness, "" craved her speech.
- Dreadful!
Wretch, knowingly you have...
Roll your eyes, bare your teeth and clench your fists!
My most blissful hour, no one can take it away from me!
Then say a prayer!
You're unable to get at me, what do you want?
At a parish fair a hunchbacked fiddler stroke up a graceful tune.
The most beautiful one of the beauties was his love.
I picked her out of the dancing crowd and took her away.
He rushed after me, he stood before me like this one, his features contorted, contorted and full of hate!
With his fiddle I killed him.
Come on then, with my hands I shall strangle all of you!
Then die, scoundrel!
Who was yelling there?
Was it not... my love?
No, no, look at me, Alviano...
Carlotta, beloved... I am with you, he lied, lied, lied!
Away, away!
A troll!
A nightmare!
Help!
Ugh, how heavy this bears!
And the red light!
Woe, woe!
Give me water.
No, give me wine.
And my love shall come, my handsome, sweet... I want Vitelozzo ere I die... I want, I want...
Yes, but where is the fiddle... At last I must go to the parish fair.
And my cap, my nice cap...
Red with silver bells.
Has no one seen the cap?
Leave me, I must at last...
Wait... what was that?
There is someone lying there...
Good people, there lies a dead man.
A presentation from a cultural and historical point of view in 7 chapters of moving pictures.
BENJAMIN CHRISTENSEN wrote the script and produced this film between the years of 1919 and 1921.
For the photography I am grateful to Mr. Johan Ankerstjerne and to Mr. Richard Louw for the art direction.
My main sources are mentioned in the theatre's playbill.
Let us look into the history of mysticism and try to explain the mysterious chapter known as the Witch.
The belief in sorcery and witchcraft is probably as old as mankind.
When primitive man is confronted with something incomprehensible, the explanation is always sorcery and evil spirits.
In Persia, the imaginary creatures depicted in the following picture were thus believed to be the cause of diseases.
The English scientist Rawlinson and French scientist Maspero show us pictures of evil spirits, believed to have resided amongst the first civilizations.
The belief in evil spirits, sorcery and witchcraft is the result of naive notions about the mystery of the universe.
Here we see how the Egyptians perceived the shape of the world
(according to Maspero).
The ancient Egyptians believed that high mountains surrounded land and water on all sides.
The sky was made of steel and supported by strong pillars that stood on the high mountains.
The stars, like lamps, hung from the sky on ropes.
According to the beliefs of other ancient civilizations, the sky was vaulted and the earth shaped into terraces.
The evil spirits of ancient times changed in the medieval folklore to devils, sneaking around and tempting children.
The devils lived in the earth's core.
In the latter part of the Middle Ages the earth was considered to be a stationary sphere in the middle of the universe.
Above the earth and its waters -
- the medieval man first imagined a layer of air -
- then a layer of fire -
- and outside the fire were the planets, moving celestial bodies.
Each planet was attached to its transparent, movable sphere.
And outside the planetary spheres were the fixed stars arranged in a sky of their own.
Above it all, in the tenth crystal sphere, sits the Almighty surrounded by nine choirs of angels and He is the One keeping the spheres revolving.
Deep down in the earth's core lies Hell, where those tempted by the Devil shall suffer forever.
In the upper part of the following picture
(from the French historian Lacroix)
The devils are stuffing the damned into large pots.
A sinner is thrown straight into the fire burning under one of the cauldrons.
A devil pours the nasty sulfur oozing from a horn down a man's throat.
Two monsters torment some of the damned with their sharp teeth.
I have found a strange old mechanical presentation of Hell, which offers a good understanding of the beliefs in the Middle Ages.
Observe the eagerness with which the devils tend to the fire under the cauldrons!
During the Middle Ages, devils and Hell were considered real and constantly feared.
Witches were thought to have signed an unlawful pact with the Devil, and therefore they were burned at the stake.
The floating figure is a devil coming to get the witch by lifting her up into the air.
This picture of a pyre as well as the following one are from "German Life in the Past in Pictures."
In this image a witch is milking an ax handle.
In the following image a witch has bewitched a man's shoe.
Witches usually meet in councils.
And after the gathering they might, for instance, sneak into a barn and bewitch a cow.
The small angular symbol, noticeable under the drawing, was usually carved into the barn door as protection against witches.
In this old naive drawing, a sorcerer and a witch are casting spells, setting a village on fire.
Witches were believed to curse people with diseases with the help of sorcerer's powder and magic potions.
Notice how the sick person is laying naked in bed.
That was habitual in the past.
It was a general belief that the witch was naked when, at night, during the so-called Witch Sabbath, she danced with the devils.
Women who wanted to participate in the "Sabbath"
sneaked away to the sorcerer where they could have their backs smeared with "witch ointment".
The witchcraft of the ointment would allow them to fly through the air.
The French doctors Bourneville and Teinturier gave me the following pictures of the Witch Sabbath a secret satanic rite to which thousands of women asserted their participation.
At the Sabbath witches and sorcerers first desecrate the Church's holy cross.
Satan gives all the participants devils' names.
And a ceremonial banquet is held.
The Sabbath food was often prepared from corpses from the gallows.
All witches had to show the Devil their respect by kissing his behind.
After a merry dance with the devils, the witches fly home at the first crow of the cock.
These scenes are often found on famous Witch Sabbath pictures from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.
To be continued.
THE WITCH Chapter 2.
We go now to the underground home of a sorceress in the year of the Lord 1488.
"Tonight the stars shine favorably over the gallows' hill."
"Ugh, what a stench!
The thief's body has been hanging too long on the gallows. "
"When such a thief's finger is too dried out, it can no longer lend the brew any healing power."
"Hurry and open up, Karna, so that the passers-by won't see me."
"Karna, can you perchance get me a love potion that has power over a pious man of the church?"
"Here, young maiden, take a potion of cat feces and dove hearts, boiled in the moonlight."
"A drop of this in a man's drink will soften his heart at once."
"Karna, can I have an even stronger potion?"
"If the maiden wishes to drive the man out of his wits for love..."
I have a potion boiled in May from a young and playful male sparrow. "
"Hold your coin, maiden!
First smell my ointment! "
"This salve is good, should you wish to travel to Brocken, one night."
"Secretly smear this salve on and the pious monk might directly come to your chamber."
"You will fly together high up in the night and he will bestow upon you many hungry kisses."
"Listen Brother, I wonder... shouldn't we pray before we embark in such a bold enterprise?"
"Oh Holy Mother, forgive us for cutting open a person's dead body with a knife!"
"It is not from untimely curiosity that we so badly sin..."
"... but so that the cause of many terrible diseases might be revealed to us."
"Help!
Hurry!
The peace of the cemetery has been desecrated by two witches. "
Such were the Middle Ages, when witchcraft and the Devil's work were sought everywhere.
And that is why unusual things were believed to be true.
"Damned woman!
You shall not lie here and bewitch the legs of honest people. "
"You watch out!
Now your filthy mouth shall remain open for eternity. "
So it happens with witchcraft as with the Devil;
people's belief in him was so strong that he became real.
The Devil is everywhere and takes all shapes.
He shows himself as a nightmare, a raging demon, a seducer, a lover, and a knight.
The devils' companion can be young and beautiful, but she is more often old, poor and miserable.
Is it from the eternal fright of the pyre that you get drunk every night, you poor old woman of the Middle Ages?
When the evening bell tolls in the night and all fires in town are covered with ashes, the Devil fetches Apelone for his adventures.
High up in the air is Apelone's dream castle, and there the Devil will fulfill all her secret wishes.
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 3.
In "Rites and Rights in the German Past" by Franz Heinemann, we can observe pictures of inquisition judges at work.
A woman suspected of witchcraft is thrown into the water to find out whether she is guilty or not.
In "History of Customs", Edward Fuchs shows us how the accused is tied up.
Two executioners use oars to move the accused in the water where she has no support.
If she floats, she will be pulled up and burned.
If she sinks, the judges thank God for her innocence.
I will now illustrate a trial for witchcraft from beginning to end taking place at the time when the Pope sent traveling inquisition priests out to Germany.
"Oh, my husband could not have been struck by dizziness so suddenly, unless a sorceress had bewitched him!"
"Be comforted Anna, wife of the Printer, the power of lead will soon reveal it."
"Oh, you powerful Saturn, allow this lead to show if Jesper the Printer is bewitched."
"It is written here in the shape of lead that his dizziness is atrocious witchcraft."
"Oh Peter, look, where is the evil sorceress?"
"You might see that witch, before you wish to..."
"... before I wish to."
"Jesus' Holy Cross and Wounds!
I did not hear you come, Maria the Weaver! "
"Oh, maiden, please have mercy on me, a poor woman who has to go begging from door to door!"
"Are you hungry, Maria?
If so, sit down. "
"Here, eat now, if you can, in the name of Jesus."
"Watch out, little sister, watch out.
That woman has evil eyes. "
"The youngest servant of the inquisition may not exchange words with a strange maiden."
"How wonderful!
It felt like fire when the young maiden took my arm. "
"Young maiden, you know quite well that what you're accusing this woman of, endangers her life?"
"Swear by the cross that you are not deadly enemies!"
"Let's go, young men, before her feet are lifted so that the evil witch won't turn us all into mice."
"Now you can have a scalding death, just what you deserve, you damned mistress of the Devil!"
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 4.
Two "honest" matrons will change the accused in jail, so that she will not wear hidden witch powder.
"Maria the Weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft."
"Master, look carefully, there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress' hair."
The suspect's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges.
Two honorable men try amiably to persuade her to confess.
If she stubbornly denies her charges, they will use a kind of mental torture.
"Woman, see here the seven holy words of Jesus crucified, written on consecrated parchment."
"I will hang them around her neck, so that the Devil will no longer help her to be silent."
"Does she see this length of consecrated wax as Corpus Christi?"
The accused is taken backwards into the torture chamber, so as not to bewitch the judge when entering.
"For the last time I ask:
Does she want to confess her witchcraft and her misdeeds? "
"Let her suffering begin so that we might put an end to the harshness of her heart."
"Oh, you learned men!
How do you expect me to confess to that which is not true? "
"Well, Rasmus the Executioner!
Let now the evil witch's body sting. "
"Let her catch her breath, Rasmus the Executioner, and loosen the screw a little at a time, as she confesses her sins."
"Oh, learned men!
I confess that I've given birth to many children fathered by the Devil. "
"And when I gave birth, Karna and all her coven helped me."
"If I am spared the pain, I will confess that Trina has smeared me with witch ointment."
"Oh yes, learned men, miserable me has flown through the night air to Brocken on Trina's broom."
"And the Devil's grandmother was there with all her witchcraft."
"And many a woman, who had not accomplished enough evil deeds, was treated miserably by the Devil."
"And masses spat upon all that is holy."
"And a meal of toads and unchristened children was cooked by Karna."
"Listen, Maria the Weaver, did you also see how the Devil put his mark on the witches' foreheads?"
"Oh, learned men, I saw the witches kiss the evil one on his behind."
"And Anna's mother, the wife of the Printer, who wished me a scalding death -"
"- that damned woman, I saw her kissing the evil one so tenderly... and Sissel, her servant, that old fool, was also there."
"And Elsa, who kicked me some time ago, she shall also burn at the stake."
"She passed Martin the Writer's door one moonlit night with her sister."
"And they cast a spell on Martin the Writer with the water they threw against his door."
"And it was the very same night that death took Martin the Writer."
"And now I will tell you everything about the witches, who yell after me in the street where I live."
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 5.
In this way begins the endless turn of the wheels during the witchcraft era.
Each witch gives ten others away.
The town wardens busy themselves.
If you oppose the capture of a witch, you must be a witch yourself.
The destiny of young Anna, wife of the Printer, is sealed.
So now only two people are left in Jesper the Printer's haunted house.
During the witchcraft era it was dangerous to be old and ugly, but it was not safe to be young and pretty either.
"Brother, help me.
My thoughts are sinful. "
"Bare your body, Brother!"
"I'll whip your sinful body and your poor soul, into faith healing."
"Oh Brother, why did you stop the beating of the scourge?
Now my soul will surely be damned. "
"Father Henrik, Brother John is spellbound."
"A witch appears in his cell to tempt him."
"And she has grabbed him by the wrist."
"Stand up, Brother, Father Henrik is coming."
"Brother, you have not given the maiden away for a witch, have you?"
"You know the punishment for those who refuse to witness against a witch?"
And so they fetch you too, young maiden, giving you their unfailing test.
"In the name of the Holy Trinity, if you are not a witch, you will now shed tears!"
"See for yourself - you cannot shed tears, as you are allied with the evil one."
We assume now that the young woman resists;
that no threat and no pain can persuade her to confess.
I have tried to find out how the excellent inquisition judges behaved in such circumstances.
And I see in front of me some scenes, which I do not find pictured too darkly here, on the white screen.
"Wake up, young maiden!
I bring you great happiness. "
"See, young maiden, I give you your freedom if you would just show me a small favor in return."
"Why do you taunt me, monk?
What favor can a poor creature like me show you? "
"Teach me the beautiful art of making thunder with this water!"
"If you do not want to take my word, young maiden, stand up and look out at the jail court."
"Did the guards leave?"
"Yes, they went far away, maiden.
The keys are now in my hand and I can secretly take you out through the town gates tonight. "
"And I swear eternal silence to you, maiden, about all you will reveal about witchcraft with thunder."
"Do you remember, maiden, that Jesper, the Printer's child, is all alone in the world, without relatives besides you?"
"Oh, Father Henrik, see the tears of the young maiden.
Look, she cries, hence she cannot be a sorceress. "
Don't you know that witches secretly smear themselves with spittle, so that we might believe it to be tears? "
"Here, maiden, see the child who will miserably perish as a dishonorable, rejected witch's offspring without you."
"Stand here and listen to all the maiden's words, so that later you may bear witness against her."
"And will you secretly open the jail gates for the child and me, if I speak?"
"Then I will tell you that once a traveling stone cutter told me..."
"... that when witches call for thunder, they put their hands in the water..."
"You hardened witch!
"And then they will burn you too, maiden,
"as edification for man, as sweet scent for God."
And one pyre after another burns in the town square, until the judges will one day move on to the next town.
The witch madness, like a spiritual plague, ravages wherever these judges go.
In the arc of a few centuries, over 8 million women, men and children were burned as witches.
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 6.
There are witch confessions that are totally insane.
Many women, for instance, confess that - transformed into cats - they soiled the altar during the night, while two devils in the shape of animals stood guard at the church door.
But there are also confessions, which might very well be close to the truth, namely during the times when superstition ruled.
Many women were burned because they confessed that they bewitched a marriage bed by "tying knots!"
For each knot a pregnancy is destroyed.
And the happiness of a whole house could be ruined with witch hair and metal crosses.
Many women have probably really used such magic tricks and believed in their destructive effects.
But, if we should judge from the confessions, we must take a closer look at the props in the torture chamber.
You and I would also be driven to confess mysterious talents with the help of such tools.
Isn't that so?
The French doctor Paul Regnard describes the way this collar was used.
The collar was tightened with the help of four taut ropes.
The wrists and ankles of the accused were tied to two iron rods screwed to the floor.
When a fire bowl was put under the poor victim -
- his movements were so violent that the spikes of the collar entered his neck.
Doctor Regnard shows another picture, which speaks for itself.
It is simply called "After the interrogation."
The "painful interrogation" preferably began with a "lighter" torture:
The thumbscrew, for example.
One of my actresses insisted on trying the thumbscrew when we shot these pictures.
I will not reveal the terrible confessions I forced from the young lady in less than a minute.
In the convents during the Middle Ages, fear of the Devil escalated into an almost hopeless despair.
The pious gave themselves up to many a regrettable self-punishment.
Often a single nun was seized, and suddenly thereafter the whole convent was overtaken by insanity -
- a mysterious, contagious insanity.
In writings that have survived to this day, these unhappy women wrote down with touching simplicity how the Devil penetrated the convent.
"Get thee behind me, Satan!"
"May all good saints stand by me!
Sister Cecilia is conniving with the evil one. "
How these religious women must have suffered, before their nerves abandoned them and insanity broke out?
In their biographies, this desperate cry is always found:
The devil forced us into it!
"Oh, Holy Mother, the evil has a terrible power!"
"Look, now he forces me into doing what I want the least."
"Burn me at the stake, pious fathers!
Can't you see what the Devil forces me to do? "
"Take me!
Don't you see him?
The evil one stands over there and threatens me. "
To be continued
THE WITCH Chapter 7.
We pass over the Devil's actual possessions
(speaking in tongues and convulsions)
And come to present times.
The majority of witches in the old days were poor women;
those who are taken in by pious organizations and nursing homes nowadays.
One or more traits that might make an old woman noticeable was enough to bring her to court during the witchcraft era.
Let us not believe that the Devil belongs solely to the past.
The lovely old woman, who plays the role of Maria the Weaver in my film, once raised her tired face to me during a pause in the shoot -
- and said: "The Devil is real.
I have seen him sitting at my bedside. "
With the old woman's permission, I show here the prayer book in which a woman (from 1921!
)
Thinks she can tell the Devil by sight.
The witch's insanity can be explained as a nervous exhaustion that I will try to exemplify here.
I ask my viewer to understand that in the following I let the same actress portray many different patients of related nervous disorders.
I have personally known a very nervous young woman who often walked in her sleep.
Why did she always enact the very same thing she was most afraid she would do?
Like a witch forced by the devil, this woman both when sleeping and awake - gives way to a mysterious craving to strike matches.
Had this possession anything to do with her morbid fear of fire after one broke out in her home?
She stated that she felt as if she were fighting against an unknown force stronger than her own.
Isn't there something "witch-like" with this sleepwalker, who moves through the slumbering household with her matches?
Doesn't she remind us of the nun, who walks through the chapel with her knife, forced by the Devil?
This poor woman, also in a bewildered condition, does during her sleep just what she fears the most.
These possessions - these somnambulistic, dazed conditions - are consistent with the nervous diseases we call hysteria.
And there are still more connections between the medieval witch and the modern hysterical person.
We remember for instance that the witch received nightly visitations by the Devil.
Today it is not the Devil, but rather a famous actor, a popular clergyman or a well-known doctor, who disturbs the calm of the night.
The hysterical person will undoubtedly say that these celebrities come to her through the wall or window.
Notice how consciously this unconscious woman holds onto her bed.
A person afflicted by hysteria always displays some artificial mannerisms.
In the Middle Ages it was believed that during the Sabbath the Devil put some invisible marks on the witch's body, where all sensitivity vanished.
The executioner often found insensitive areas on the back of the accused.
"I see clearly that you are a witch.
You do not even feel the master's instrument on your back. "
Today, this strange insensitivity is considered a symptom of hysteria.
"No sir, I do not feel you touching my back at all."
"Yes, it is as I thought; your daughter is suffering from hysteria."
"From what you told me, I must strongly recommend that we detain your daughter for the time being in my clinic."
"It would be a pity if your daughter were to have an unpleasant exchange with the police."
Poor little hysterical witch!
In the Middle Ages you were in conflict with the church.
Now it is with the law.
"I ask you to step into my office."
"Or do you prefer that I call the police?"
"Your name?
Do you have a card? "
"Your address?
Do you have a telephone in your home? "
"Thank you, that's fine.
You can leave.
I will contact you later. "
"If my family learns about this, I will be forcefully detained."
"I beg you to understand that I am an unhappy, sick person.
I do not know what I am doing. "
"I have not been able to live with this persistent fear during the war.
I am a broken person. "
"It is as if an unknown power compels me to commit this terrible theft."
"Look here!
I just stole this little, expensively bound Russian book. "
"What shall I do with it?
I do not know a word of Russian. "
"My husband died in the war, and I have not been the same since..."
"I promise not to pursue this matter, but I have to ask you never to visit my store again."
Centuries have passed and the Almighty of medieval times no longer sits in his tenth sphere.
We no longer sit in church staring terrified at the frescoes of the devils.
The witch no longer flies away on her broom over the rooftops.
But isn't superstition still rampant among us?
Is there an obvious difference between the sorceress and her customer then and now?
We no longer burn our old and poor.
But do they not often suffer bitterly?
And the little woman, whom we call hysterical, alone and unhappy, isn't she still a riddle for us?
Nowadays we detain the unhappy in a mental institution or if she is wealthy - in a modern clinic.
And then we will console ourselves with the notion that the mildly temperate shower of the clinic has replaced the barbaric methods of medieval times.

The End
The Hands of Orlac
Madam, it is 9 o'clock and the train arrives at 11
To Montgeron
He is alive!
It is 6: 30, Professor.
Vasseur will be executed at 6 o'clock, and 8 minutes later the car will bring the body to the clinic.
A train accident.
There is damage at the base of the skull, where we will operate... only... only his hands
And yet there is hope. The hands... holy God... the hands...
Save his hands... his hands are his life....
Save his hands... his hands are more important than his life.
Save his hands...
I will try.
After only a short time, you can come home... and sun, light and many flowers will greet you, when you come.
We will remove your bandages - a little at a time.
Today you will see your face again.
Your eyes - how I love you... your hair... and your hands... your beautiful, dear hands...
There... his head... doesn't he see my hands?
"Is he laughing?"
Now... he is so strong!
Tell me, what are under these bandages?
What secret do they hide?
Well, then, in God's name, we will reveal the secret.
Can these hands ever play again?
The spirit rules the hands... nature and a strong will can do anything.
Tomorrow... back tomorrow!
I will wait here... his first kiss and the first stroke of his hands.
The last night.
Your hands were not saved...
Dr. Serral gave you different ones. The hands of the executed murderer Vasseur.
Is it true?
Do I have the hands of the murderer Vasseur?
How much longer?
In half an hour.
No, only 30 minutes.
These hands will never strike a man again.
How much longer
I love you...
I love you...
Do you have the paper for January 15?
I feel it also go out... the arms spread... until then in the soul... cold, terrible, grim.
Twisted - twisted hands!
Don't come any closer to me!
Go away...
I will not listen to you any longer.
... Debauch your hands...
Don't mix... away with your hands... such murderer's hands...
Take away your hands.
I don't want these terrible hands.
Creditors
Only wait a short time... one month...
I know it...
You demand blood...
Crimes...
Murder...
Only one week!
Men don't just control the hands...
The head, the heart control the body..., also the hands...
Until tomorrow!
My hat and my coat...
I am going to my husband's father.
He is rich... he can help... if he will...
Don't go there... he is an evil man... he hates all men and even more so your husband...
I can't leave anyone to him... At the least everyone from... there
Mr. Orlac - you know, what bad luck has happened to him
Mr. Orlac - Paul cannot play now.
So we are in need.
But Paul doesn't know... help us.
He is your son... your flesh and blood... will you let us be ground in to the earth...
Yes, I would like to see it!
I hate him...
Mr. Orlac must himself go to see his father... today!
How will madam pay...
Beloved, yet one day and one night, and then I will be with you again.
I will hold you in my arms... my...
That was... once... my handwriting
He refused to help... and I have begged him so... he is not a good man, your father... he is evil. I fear him..
Murder!
The murderer Vasseur's dagger!
The fingerprints of the criminal Vasseur!
Vasseur's handwriting!
I do not know what secret he is going to give us.
Vasseur has been dead for years, but his hands still live.
Paul Orlac, you are your father's heir.
You will bring me a million tomorrow.
At this time!
Money?
Money?
And therefore you follow me awake and in my dreams?
Why?
For my hands!
Who are you?
I am Vasseur, who was executed on July 13th.
The experiment that Professor Serral performed with your hands his assistant made off with my head.
If I don't get the million tomorrow at this time I will go to the State Prosecutor and tell him who your father's murderer is.
Who is the murderer?
You are...
Paul Orlac!
These fingerprints, which are clearly visible are the fingerprints of Vasseur.
And who has those fingers now - you, Paul Orlac!
The letter, which passed through all the servants in the house, was written by the hand of Vasseur, and this hand is now - your hand!
The dagger, with which the murder was done is Vasseur's dagger with the X.
Your maid will swear, that she saw you with it - in your hand..
Perhaps you did not do the murder - but you cannot deny....
What is happening to me?
Am I crazy?
Won't you tell me what is bothering you?
I have the feeling, that these hands are drawing me... to crime....
I must bring him the money.
You will tell the State Prosecutor everything...
Who will believe me?
They will believe you - as I believe you.
I go in a free man.
Wait, perhaps, and we will have news for the evening paper.
It is odd, but I don't know, whether I am experiencing reality or a dream. It is odd, but I don't know, whether I am experiencing reality or a dream.
A stranger.
He was then executed... I have seen with my own eyes the work of the guillotine on a neck.
He was then executed... I have seen with my own eyes the work of the guillotine on a neck.
Mr. Orlac, we thank you for your evidence...
Go this evening, bring the money with you to the stranger,
And we will follow you.
Someone well known to us - Mr. Nera, at last. Assistant to Professor Serral,
One of the least talented crooks in the world.
I am also a blackmailer.
But, you are searching for the murderer?
Haven't you considered, that the murderer has Vasseur's hands... I don't have those hands.
Haven't you considered, that the murderer has Vasseur's hands...
I can tell you who has those hands.
Mr. Orlac, I arrest you!
Mr. Orlac is not guilty - Nera is the murderer.
Keep silent!
Explain the fingerprints of the executed Vasseur!
Nera was Vasseur's friend... He secretly made imprints of Vasseur's fingerprints
And then he had rubber gloves made... with Vasseur's fingerprints.
And so he killed the elder Orlac...
And so he killed the old racketeer and then made it look as if Vasseur had done it.
If Vasseur was not guilty... then my hands are pure...

PARIS ASLEEP
One evening, Paris went to sleep and the following morning the night watchman in the Eiffel Tower wonders why not a thing is stirring in the city and since no one comes...
CHI EF OF POLICE
At the Paris airport.
"Everything came to a standstill last night except for me up in the Eiffel Tower."
"And us in our plane."
A thief always comes in handy.
"We mustn't let it get us down!"
"I'll see that every shop is open for you even the Bank of France!"
Paris is all theirs.
But what good are riches when you're bored?
"If anyone's listening please come to... A handkerchief in the window."
"This is where the powerful rays came from that put everyone to sleep."
"It's my uncle, Professor X!"
"You must wake everyone up!"
"I never thought of that!"
"I'll give it a try."
"It's 3: 25 a.m., the same time."
"You betrayed me!"
"We're going to make some money... thanks to your uncle's invention."
"The whole city was asleep for four days."
"You all say the same thing!"
"We're all telling the truth."
"Go tell your tales somewhere else."
"Did we dream this whole thing up?"
"No, it wasn't a dream!"

Part one. "MEN AND MAGGOTS."
The spirit of revolution soared over the Russian land.
A tremendous, mysterious process was taking place in countless hearts.
The individual personality, having hardly had time to become conscious of itself... dissolved in the mass, and the mass itself became dissolved in the revolutionary élan.
Sailors Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk.
We, the sailors of Potemkin, must support the workers, our brothers... and stand among the front lines of the revolution!
Heavy and gloomy is the sleep of the off duty.
Attentive, but clumsy.
He vents his anger on a young man.
Hurtful...
Vakulinchuk
Comrades!
The time has come when we too must speak out.
Why wait?
All of Russia has risen!
Are we to be the last?
Morning.
We've had enough rotten meat!
Even a dog wouldn't eat this!
The ship doctor Smirnov.
It could crawl overboard on its own!
These aren't worms.
They are dead fly larvae.
You can wash them off with brine!
Russian prisoners in Japan are fed better than we are!
We've had enough rotten meat!
It's good meat.
End of discussion!
Senior Officer Giliarovsky
Impotent rage was overflowing.
The ship's store.
The sailors refused to eat the borscht.
GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD
Part two. "DRAMA ON THE DECK."
Commander Golikov
Whoever is satisfied with the borscht take two steps forward!
The petty officers.
You're free to go!
I'll hang the rest on the yard!
Call the guards!
Matyushenko, under the guise of breaking ranks, calls the sailors to the gun turret.
To the turret...
To the turret!
To the turret...
Guys!...
It's time.
Most of them gathered by the turret.
Stop!
Don't move!
They try to sneak through the admiral's hatch.
Back, scoundrels!
That way is not for you!
I'll shoot you all like dogs!
Cover them with canvas!
Got it!
Cover them!
Attention!
Dear Lord!
Make the disobedient see reason!
Fire right into the canvas!
Vakulinchuk decides.
Fire!
BROTHERS!
Who are you shooting at?!
The rifles quavered.
Shoot!
Everyone shoot!
Shoot, scum!
To the rifles, brothers!
Smash the dragons!
Smash 'em!
Smash 'em all!
Have fear of God!
Beat it, sorcerer!
To the bottom to feed the worms!
Brothers!
We've won!
The bleeding Vakulinchuk flees from the furious Giliarovsky.
Vakulinchuk's overboard!
Save Vakulinchuk!
And he who was first to sound the cry of rebellion was first to fall at the executioner's hand.
To the shore.
Odessa.
A tent on the new pier in Odessa is the final resting place for Vakulinchuk.
FOR A SPOONFUL OF BORSCHT
Part three. "THE DEAD MAN CALLS OUT."
Mist lingered on from the night...
Rumours came from the pier.
Together with the sun, the news hit the city.
The battleship raided rebellion shore...
A killed sailor...
We'll remember.
For a spoonful of borscht.
"Citizens of Odessa!
Lying before you is the body of the brutally killed sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk... killed by a senior officer of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky.
Let's take revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires!
Death to the oppressors! Signed: Crew of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky. "
Eternal memory to the fallen fighters!
All for one.
One for all.
Down with the executioners!
Down with tyranny!
Mothers and brothers!
Let there not be differences or hostility among us!
Smash the Jews!
Shoulder to shoulder.
The land is ours.
Tomorrow is ours.
A delegate from shore.
The enemy must be dealt a decisive blow!
Together with the rebelling workers from all of Russia
WE WILL WIN!
The shore watched Potemkin tensely and attentively.
Part four. "THE ODESSA STAIRCASE."
In those memorable days, the city lived together with the rebellious battleship.
Like a white-winged flock, boats flew to the battleship.
AND SUDDENLY
Let's go!
Let's convince them!
Listen!
Don't shoot!
My boy is badly hurt.
COSSACKS!
And then the brutality of the military authorities in Odessa was answered with the battleship's shells.
The target - the Odessa theater.
The generals' headquarters.
Part five. "RENDEZVOUS WITH THE SQUADRON."
Turbulent meetings went on until evening.
The people of Odessa are waiting for the liberators!
Land the troops and the army will join you.
Landing is not possible.
The admiral's squadron is coming our way.
With one heart, they decided to face the squadron.
Night came, full of anxiety.
The squadron was sneaking up in the darkness.
Sore from constant speech, throats breathe heavily and unevenly.
Squadron on the horizon!
All hands on deck!
Prepare for battle!
Full speed!
Hearts forward!
Top speed!
Potemkin and destroyer No. 267.
The admiral attacks!
The squadron draws near!
Give the signal: join us!
Join!...... us!
The enemy is within firing range!
All against one.
ONE AGAINST ALL.
... or...
BROTHERS!
Above the heads of the tsar's admirals thundered a brotherly hurrah.
And proudly waving the red flag of victory, without a single shot, the rebellious battleship passed through the rows of the squadron.
In the great Gold Rush, Alaska was the hope and dream of men, the ruthless siren of the Far North, beckoning thousands to her icy bosom.
Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier to the gold fields.
Over this Pass men faced untold misery and hardship.
Many lost their lives. Some fell by the wayside, others lost courage and turned back. But the brave went on.
Far into the icy north, deep into the silent nowhere, came an undaunted lone prospector.
And somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector.
With cheerful optimism our little Columbus descended, then stopped, stepped, slipped and slid.
"Now let me see," thought the little fellow. "Before I know where I am, I must get there."
There in that frozen wilderness a dream came true, and a lone voice shrieked into the solemn sky,
"Eureka!
I've found it, a mountain of gold! "
But the elements laughed, roared and thundered.
In that raging nowhere was a lone cabin, and another lone man, Black Larson, an unmitigated, predatory scoundrel.
Out of the lashing storm came the Little Fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality.
There he sat, resting his weary bones as the icy wind howled through the knothole.
"Come here," said Larson.
"What are you doing?"
"Eating, obviously."
"Get out."
"Go on!"
"Get out!"
The wind also was giving Big Jim his troubles.
Big Jim was the noble type. He had suffered.
Oh, how he loved to suffer.
He suffered about everything.
"Get out," said Black Larson.
"Or I'll fill you both full of lead."
"Now then, the pair of you, get out!"
"Out!"
That kind of noise Jim don't tolerate.
"I'll stay right here, understand?"
"Right here," said Big Jim.
"Yes, sir, he'll stay right here," said the Little Fellow.
"Understand?
We stay right here. "
And stay they did, for days and nights. The cabin moaned and groaned.
Two men walked and never talked, hunger gnawed their bones.
"I must have food!" yelled Big Jim.
"I must have food!"
"What are you eating?" Said Black Larson.
"Nothing."
"Open your mouth!"
"Liar! It's that candle."
"That?" said the Little Fellow.
"How revolting."
"If I thought you were holding out on me, I'd slit your gizzard!"
"One of us must brave that storm, if we're to get food."
"Come here, the pair of you."
"We'll cut the cards and the low man goes."
"You're the man," said Jim.
"Goodbye, good luck."
"Don't forget to bring home the bacon."
Somewhere in that nowhere, the law was looking for Black Larson.
Desperate with hunger and here it was Thanksgiving Day.
Nevertheless there was something to be thankful for.
"Not quite done yet, give it two more minutes."
"Come on, come on," said Big Jim.
After scouring the country for food, the Little Fellow had to admit he had seen nothing, not even a field mouse.
From the pangs of hunger, Big Jim was becoming delirious, hysterical.
In fact he was a pain in the neck.
"Food, food!" he thundered.
"I can put another shoe in the pot."
"No, no, anything but that!"
Poor Jim, he couldn't take it.
"What's the matter?" Said the Little Fellow.
"I thought you were a chicken."
"Well, build up the fire," said Big Jim.
"What's the matter with you?" Said the Little Fellow.
"Come, my pretty bird," said Big Jim.
"Don't be childish."
"Hey, quit it. Don't be foolish, it's me!"
"You!" said Jim.
"I'm sorry. I must be crazy."
"You're telling me," said the Little Fellow.
"You go inside. I'll take the gun in case you lose it."
Chicken or no chicken, the Little Fellow looks appetizing to Big Jim.
Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled onto Big Jim's mountain of gold.
Then came the parting of the ways,
Big Jim to his mine, our hero to his fate.
"Goodbye," said the Little Fellow.
"It's been a great pleasure knowing you."
Treachery awaited Big Jim at his mountain of gold.
Big Jim looked deep into the eyes of Black Larson and saw there the soul of a skunk.
Caught in a maelstrom of desperate deeds, Black Larson swept on to impending doom.
And out of a dream in that frozen waste, a city grew.
And humanity warmed it with living, loving and desiring.
Georgia.
Jack was a ladies' man.
Georgia was quick and impulsive, proud and independent.
In the evening Georgia worked as a dancehall girl.
Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia.
Perhaps that's why she resented him.
Out of the night came the Little Fellow, towards the dancehall, that beacon light of pleasure, that retreat of lost dreams.
"Georgia, why aren't you nice to Jack?"
"I believe he really likes you," said the girl.
"He likes everybody," said Georgia quite audibly.
"I'm bored with this place," she continued.
"I'd give it all up if I could find someone honest and worthwhile."
"Don't worry, I'll find him someday."
Then she turned and looked and looked and looked.
"Kinda fresh, ain't ya?" Thought Jack.
"Get down off that high horse."
"Me and you are gonna dance."
"Hey there, pan out a tune."
"Just a moment, I said we're gonna dance."
"I beg your pardon," said Georgia.
To show her utter contempt for Jack, she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall.
"Hey you, come here."
"Yes, you.
Do you want to dance? "
"You see, I'm very particular about whom I dance with."
And there he stood, the dauntless cavalier, guarding... her sanctuary.
"If you wanna make a hit with your lady friend," "you should put your hat on straight, like this!"
"Take that you... Ouch!"
"Huh! Very good."
"Didn't know me own strength," said the Little Fellow.
Hank Curtis' cabin was a stone's throw from the dancehall.
Hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the Far North.
Hank was kind and human, and our hero cold and hungry, and the beans smelled good and the coffee was steaming hot.
So the Little Fellow devised a way of getting breakfast.
Big Jim recovered from the blow he received from Black Larson but lost his memory.
Hank's partner arrives.
Both are ready to leave on a long expedition.
Hank informs his partner that the Little Fellow is to look after the cabin while he's away.
"Goodbye," said Hank. "And don't forget to feed the mule."
Since that night in the dancehall the Little Fellow hadn't seen Georgia, but an incident was to bring them together again.
There she stood, her loveliness lighting the room, filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill-fitted.
As she introduced her friends, his heart began to sing.
As they warmed up by the stove, he excused himself to get firewood.
And in that cabin his secret was revealed, his love for Georgia.
And the girls giggled and laughed, perhaps in order to hide their pity.
For in the world of the dancehall it wasn't wise for the girls to reveal their hearts.
And so they thought they'd have a little fun with him.
There in the gloaming they sat, their faces alight with mischief, but all the while his heart was singing.
And so she fooled and flirted and stroked his hair.
He knew she was fooling, but he was happy. For she was near him, holding his hand, smiling at him.
"Nice place you have here," said Georgia.
"I hope you will invite us again."
What if she were fooling?
He was enjoying the warmth of her attention. And the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair.
And now she was leaving.
The light of her loveliness would be gone.
And he would be left with an emptiness, to return to his bleak, lonely existence.
"Pardon me," said the Little Fellow, "But, uh..." He was lost for words.
"Would you really like to come again?"
"Of course," said Georgia.
"What do you say, girls?"
"We'll come for dinner New Year's Eve," said the ladies.
"Very well," said Georgia. "We'll come to dinner New Year's Eve."
Of course at that moment Georgia would forget her gloves!
For the next few days the Little Fellow hustled and shoveled in order to buy that New Year's dinner.
The eve of a new year. New hopes and new dreams.
And there was Georgia, caressing him with her smiles and tender glances.
And the girls called for a speech.
But he was too happy to speak.
All that mattered was Georgia was there. Georgia!
So he muttered and stuttered and finally said,
"I can't make a speech but I'll do a dance."
And a dance he did, with the rolls.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne
For auld lang syne My dear
For auld lang...
In the midst of all their revelry the vague memory of a promise crept into Georgia's mind.
"Let's go up and visit the Little Fellow," she said.
"We'll have some fun with him," said Jack.
"We'll send Georgia in first, then give him a scare."
"Oh, forget it," said Jack.
"How about giving me a little attention?"
A day or so later in the Recorder's office, Big Jim tried to convince the assayers that he had a mountain of gold.
"Where is this place?" they said.
But Big Jim's memory had failed him.
All he knew was that it was near the cabin.
"The cabin, that's it!"
"F I could find my way to the cabin I could find the mine."
"But I can't remember."
"Hey!" said Jack, "Georgia's been looking for you."
The Little Fellow knew otherwise. How dare that cad mention her name so lightly?
For two pins he'd give him another thrashing.
However being a little underweight he would ignore the insult.
But it was true. Georgia had been looking for him. Georgia had written him a letter.
And as he went looking for Georgia, so Big Jim went looking for him.
"You, you!" said Big Jim.
"You! The very man I've been looking for!"
"The cabin, the cabin!
Where is it? "
"Answer me, I say!"
"Can't you speak, man?
Tell me! "
"Where's the cabin?
Where is it? "
"At last I shall find my mountain of gold."
"To your feet man, quick!"
"You're coming with me!"
"Take me to the cabin and I'll make you a millionaire!"
"Georgia!
Just a moment, "said the Little Fellow.
"Georgia, you don't have to explain. I understand."
"I love you. I'll take you away from this life."
"I'm going away, and when I return," "I shall come back."
Exhausted and footweary, they arrived at the cabin.
"Ah!" said Big Jim, "it won't be long now."
"Bring in the eats and tomorrow we'll start for the mine.
"Here, take a swig of this.
It'll put hair on your topcoat. "
"My, this is a heavy lamb chop," said the Little fellow.
Then fate - it's always fate - played its little joke, and again the elements laughed, roared and thundered, but through it all our heroes soundly slumbered.
Then came the dawn.
The Little Fellow awoke, blissfully ignorant of what happened the night before, but feeling definitely conscious of "the morning after".
"Oh well, may as well tidy up and get breakfast."
"This is the worst liver attack I've ever had."
"Feel that rocking?"
"It's the stomach."
"It's not the stomach."
"Let's go to the other side."
"We'll see how far it will go over."
"Something must be missing underneath."
"I'll go outside and see what it is."
"Now," said Big Jim, "don't get excited."
"Take it easy, don't move, don't breathe!"
"I said don't breathe, stupid."
"You can be most annoying at times."
"If you'll only be cool, be calm," said Big Jim, "We have nothing to worry about."
"Now show a little character!
Where's your willpower? "
"Now listen, I've got a very good idea."
"Hold your hands like this, then I can get out first."
"You see what I mean?" Said Big Jim.
"Your mind is chaotic. You have no psychology." "You have no control."
And Big Jim discovered his claim!
"Now we shall be rich," said Jim.
"We shall be millionaires!"
And so they were.
Now they were homeward bound and they were leaving the hardship and toil of Alaska to live in the land of milk and honey.
To live, laugh and indulge themselves in the lap of luxury.
They were famous, and sought after by the press.
In their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon.
The reporter wanted to write the Little Fellow's life story,
"From Rags to Riches", and he graciously consented.
And Big Jim was manicured.
"Not the nails," said he, "the corns."
The reporter thought of a good idea, to have the Little Fellow pose in his mining clothes.
It would make a human story.
Georgia...
There she was in the steerage. Neither knew of the other's presence.
Georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard.
"You!" said Georgia.
"I thought I'd never see you again."
And then she mistook him for the stowaway.
The officer was going to put him in irons.
But Georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare.
"Heck!" said the Captain. "That's no stowaway."
"That's Big Jim's partner, the multimillionaire."
Then of course there were apologies.
The Little Fellow gathered himself together. James, the valet, was told to prepare for an extra guest.
"Pardon me," said the reporter, "but who's the lady?"
"Buzz buzz buzz!" "Oh, you don't say!
Well, congratulations. "
"This will make a great story, and with a happy ending."
And so it was.
A happy ending.

Sanctuary of song lovers,
The Paris Opera House, rising nobly over medieval torture chambers, hidden dungeons, long forgotten.
Melody floats through hall and corridor, even to the executive offices, where a strange deal is being closed.
Now the Notary's seal, gentlemen, and you are the fortunate new owners.
It is barely possible you may hear of a ghost, a Phantom of the Opera!
The attendant of Box Five will not laugh when you ask about the opera ghost!
You jest, Messieurs!
We are not children!
Who occupies Box Five?
I do not know.
I have seen only the cloaked figure of a man who hides his face and will not speak!
Is it the Phantom?
The Phantom!
The Phantom is up from the cellars again!
We saw him for an instant... a gray shadow... and he was gone!
He had no nose!
Yes, he did, it was enormous!
That man came out of the cellars... just after we saw the Phantom.
Could it be that he...?
Joseph Buquet has really seen the Phantom!
Let's ask him...
His eyes are ghastly beads in which there is no light... like holes in a grinning skull!
His face is like leprous parchment, yellow skin strung tight over protruding bones!
His nose... there is no nose!
Have a care, Buquet... ghosts like not to be seen or talked about!
Come, I'll show you where I saw him... in the scene-dock of the third cellar.
I saw him there!
A flash of shadow, and he was gone!
My daughter, Carlotta has been insulted!
She, the favorite prima donna of the Paris Opera!
Mlle Carlotte,
Christine Daaé will sing the role of "Marguerite", Wednesday night!
Any jealous attempt on your part to interefere with the performance will prove disastrous to your career.
The Phantom
"No ghost will frighten Carlotta!
Wednesday evening you will hear her singing! "
Wednesday night found Mlle.
Carlotta strangely ill, and Christine Daae singing "Marguerite '.
"What is this I hear about Christine favoring some mysterious admirer. instead of you, Raoul?"
"Don't worry, my dear Brother- nothing shall interfere with our love.
"I hear alot of rumors, Raoul-be careful!"
"At last you have realized your ambition, my darling, and now we shall be married."
"I can never leave the Opera, Raoul.
You must forget out love. "
From hidden places beyond the walls a melodious voice, like the voice of an angel, spoke to her.
"Christine tonight I placed the world at your feet!"
"To you I have imparted the full measure of my art.
You will triumph - all Paris will worship you! "
But I warn you, you must forget all worldly things and think only of your career - and your Master! "
"Soon, Christine, this spirit will take form and command your love!"
"Call for me when you will.
I shall be waiting. "
In Mlle. Carolotta's correspondence there appeared another letter, edged in black!
Mlle Carlotta If you appear tomorrow night you must be prepared for a great misfortune, and therefore I advise you to be "ill" The Phantom
"Christine Daae's friends are plotting again!
But my daughter shall sing tomorrow night, come what may! "
My dear Managers - The role of "Marguerite" shall be sung again tomorrow evening by Christine Daae, instead of Carlotta The Phantom
P.S. If you refuse this you will present Faust in a house with a curse on it.
Encouraged by her mother, Carlotta defied every warning, and the following evening appeared as - "Marguerite '.
"So far so good - for a house with a curse on it!"
I cannot explain, but you must never intend to see me again.
- Christine
"Beware!
She is singing to bring down the chandelier! "
"Christine I have come for you -'
"I am ready, Master - waiting!"
Walk to your mirror, my dear - - have no fear! "
"Christine, it is I - your Master!"
"Look not upon my mask - think rather of my devotion which has brought you the gift of song."
A black lake, hidden from man and the sun, leading to the Phantom's rendezvous.
"I have brought you here - - five cellars underground -"
"- because I love you!"
"For long weary months I have awaited this hour!"
"So that which is good within me, aroused by your purity, might plead for your love."
"That is where I sleep."
"It keeps me reminded of that other dreamless sleep that cures all ills - forever!"
"You
- Your are the Phantom! "
"If I am the Phantom, it is because man's hatred has made me so."
"If I shall be saved, it will be because your love redeems me."
"Men once knew me as Erik, but for many years I have lived in these cellars, a nameless legend."
Another Phantom Tragedy
Christine Daae Disappears
Opera Singer Mysteriously Vanishes Following Chandelier Disaster
The night passed - a night of vague horrors -- tortured dreams--
Christine
My dear Christine You are in no peril as long as you do not touch my mask.
You will be free as long as your love for the spirit of Erik overcomes your fear. Erik
Don Juan Triumphant
"Since first I saw your face, this music has been singing to me of you and of - love triumphant!"
"Yet listen -- there sounds an ominous undercurrent of warning!"
"Feast, your eyes - glut your soul, on my accursed ugliness!"
"Oh, mad Christine, who would not heed my warning!"
"If you love me, as you say, let me go.
I promise to your slave forever! "
I shall prove tlo you the debth of my love.
You may return to your world for the present.
You may sing in the opera once more. "
"But, remember, you are mine-mine-and you shall not see your lover again!
If you do, it is death to you both! "
"Oh, I swear it, I swear it!
I shall never see him again! "
Although I gave my word never to see you again I must.
I will be at the Bal Masque tomorrow night, but not alone beware! Christine
One night each year, all Paris mingled, forgetful of caste-- the merry. mad Bal Masque de l'Opera.
Into the midst of revelry, strode a spectral figure, robed in red.
"Beneath your dancing feet are the tombs of tortured men- this does the Red Death rebuke your merriment!"
High above Paris on the roof of the Opera!
Are we alone, Raoul?
Can anyone overhear what we say?
I have seen him, Raoul!
I have seen the Phantom! "
He is a monster- a loathsome beast!
You must saveme from him, Raoul!
Mlle. Carlotta, under the spell of his curse will never sing again.
Tomorrow I take her place in Faust.
After the performance you must take me away! "
I shall be at the stage door.
We will flee to England.
She has betrayed me!
Not that way- this way!
That was the Opera ghost!
-ERIK- Born during the Boulevard Massacre Self educated musican and master of Black Art
Exited to Devil's Island for criminal insane
ESCAPED NOW AT LARGE
This is your man.
Monsleur le Prefect
- The Phantom of the Opera! "
At nine o'clock the following evening a mysterious barouche stopped on the rotunda side of the Opera.
Wait for me at the west gate.
I have heard his voice once more, Raoul.
He knows our plans -- everything. "
Believe in my love, Raoul.
Save me from that monster - oh, save me!
My barouche is waiting outside.
We leave immediately after the performance!
Dry your tears, dear, and hasten -- you must make ready for your performance!
Come quick!
The strangler's work again!
It was there!
I saw the body dangling in the air!
My brother - - poor Joseph, he knew too much about the Phantom!
The Punjab lasso - the strangler's cord!
Assassin!
Hide yourself in the deepest shadows
- but I shall find you out!
Fear for his brother's safety, brought Comte de Chagny to the Opera house that night.
I think i can take you to Christine Daae
- if you do exactly as I tell you.
Who are you that knows the Phantom's secrets - and betrays them?
I am Ledoux of the Secret Police.
I have studied this Phantom for months.
I found his hiding place deep within the torture chambers where he himself was confined during the second Revolution.
Keep your hand up- the strangler's noose coils quick!
Your hand up - it is a matter of life or death
The discovery of this trap-door cost Joseph Buquet his life.
I am a messenger from the shadows
-- turn back ere ye perish!
You lied to me!
Do you think you and your lover could cheat the Phantom?
Ungrateful fool!
You have spurned the spirit that inspired you
-- the spirit that made you great!
Now, you shall see the evil spirit that makes my evil face!
No Longer like a toad in these foul cellarswill i secrete the venom of hatred for you shall bring me love!
We should be within his hiding place, now.
We have fallen into the room of many mirrors the old torture chamber!
I am human like other men - - I will not be cheated of my happiness!
Raoul!
Raoul!
My Brother- where are you?
It seems we have callers.
Christine!
Christine!
Can you hear me?
Your voice sounds near-
Try to find a door that will lead to us.
Look about you - try to learn where he keeps the keys.
The callers have departed.
I have discovered the Phantom's hiding place
- tonight my brother will be avenged!
Did you hear voices?
Perhaps we have more callers.
Heat - intolerable heat!
Fools - do they think they can match their wits against Erik?
What do you offer for their lives?
Your answer. quick - they can survive but a few moments!
Gunpowder!
You have your chance of saving him. Will you be the bride of Erik, or do you prefer to watch your lover die?
Will you be the bride of Erik, or do you prefer to watch your lover die?
If you turn the Scorpion - you have said 'Yes' and spared de Chagny.
Turn the grasshopper -- and the Opera House is blown to a thousand bits!
I'll do anything you say, if you will only save them!

FACES OF CHILDREN
Saint-Luc, a village in the Upper Valais.
The mayor's house.
On this spring morning, all those not kept away by toll have come because there is sorrow in the house.
The mayor, Pierre Amsler.
His son, Jean.
His daughter, Pierrette.
A neighbor.
The mother of the two children.
"Where is Mama?"
"She's away on a trip."
"He's had a shock, nothing life-threatening.
A few days' rest and he'll be himself again. "
Canon Taillier, the priest of Vissoy, was Jean's godfather.
And for Amsler, life returned to normal and he managed as well as could be expected.
It hurt him to see his children left on their own, his home poorly cared for.
"... And this torn sleeve!"
Every night, Jean whispered a prayer to his mother.
Staring at the portrait as he did, he thought it came to life and smiled at him.
Like every Sunday.
Saint Martin's day, when the tenant farmers pay their rent.
Her daughter, Arlette.
"I can't pay."
"The accident that cost my husband his life was blamed on his carelessness." "So the insurance company, invoking the regulations, didn't pay anything."
And spring returned.
Amsler often cut through Jeanne Dutois' fields.
The first Sunday in June.
"Jean, I have business to see to.
You go alone. "
"If you agree, we could be married before Saint John's Day."
"I'm going to spend a few days with my old friend, Father Porchet.
How are the children? "
"I'm going to remarry."
"The house is empty and there's no one to take care of little Pierrette.
It would be the best thing for the children. "
"What about Jean...
Did you tell him? "
"No, not yet."
"He's such a sensitive child.
I think you'd better prepare him gently. "
The next day.
"You have things to talk about. I'll get out of your way."
"Well?"
"Would you speak to Jean?
I think you'd explain it better than me.
He's a good boy, but he's so sensitive. "
"I have an idea!
I'll take Jean with me to Vissoy for a few weeks. Then I can gently break the news to him there. "
"And when he comes home, things will have returned to normal, and he'll adapt without too much trouble to the new situation."
The next day, at dawn, the priest set off with his godson.
Having got through the pass, they went down into the next valley.
By nightfall, they could see the belltower of Vissoy.
At the end of the hay harvesting, Saint-Luc celebrated the marriage of its mayor.
"When you get home, you'll find some changes, Jean.
Your father is going to remarry. "
"Your duty, my child, is to also think of your loved ones."
"Do you want to see your sister Pierrette brought up badly, and your papa living sad and alone for the rest of his life?"
"Do I have to call her Mama, too?"
"Well then... call her mother."
At the end of the month...
His heart heavy, but full of good intentions, Jean set out on the road home.
He saw things again as if he'd been away for years.
Before he even crossed the threshold, the house already seemed different.
"What do I want?
I want to get into my own house, that's what! "
"Mama said I wasn't to let anyone in."
"Sure, but I'm Jean. I live here."
"Who said you could use my crayons?"
"Mama did."
"Pierrette and I sleep in here.
You sleep in the small room in the back. "
"You have to listen to me, because I'm your mama now.
Then I'll love you and you'll be my little boy. "
"I want you to be cheerful.
I don't like children who mope or who daydream. They're just lazy. "
"Yes, ma'am."
The snack.
"and you're not to fight, or envy one another, but love and help one another."
The following Sunday.
Jean had just noticed his mother's brooch.
"What's the matter?"
From the first weeks, the animosity between the children was evident.
Pierrette and Jean always played on "their island", far from Arlette, who couldn't play with them.
"Where's your hat?"
One day, they cleaned out the attic.
"The material is good. I could make a dress for each of you out of it."
"It's not yours. It's my mama's."
"Why did you do that?"
"Answer me!"
"Will you answer?"
"I hate her!
I hate her!
I hate her! "
After several months, Arlette and Jean now hated each other.
"My doll!
I lost my doll! "
"It's too late to go looking for it now."
The evening at home.
"It's silly to cry over a lost doll at your age."
"Go upstairs. I'll be up in a moment."
"I'm sure your doll fell near the bridge."
"It's not far. Go on.
I'll open the door for you. "
Jean had merely hoped that Arlette would get a scolding.
He began to see the seriousness of what he had done.
Lost.
"Did you hear the avalanche?"
The only solution:
to admit everything right away.
"Are you sick?"
"I want to speak to Papa."
"Come inside and pray."
Full of shame and anxiousness, he turned to his mother's portrait but the image seemed distant and faded.
Even the portrait had abandoned him.
The next morning.
His father hadn't made the slightest reproach.
Jean thought he had become an object of horror to his family.
He felt like a criminal.
Dear Papa, Goodbye.
I'm a wretch.
I hope you'll forgive me.
Love, Jean.
"I'm going away forever."
"Since you forgive me, will you give me a kiss?"
"Mama."
THE END
THE IMAGINARY VOYAGE by Renè Clair (1925)
One summer morning, in a small country town.
A poor and shy young man was going to work in a bank.
Auguste, a work mate.
Albert, another employee.
Lucie, a typist.
The bank manager.
Rosa Koslex, "authorized" palmist.
"I see three men who love you!"
"You will marry the man you love!"
"You will marry the woman you love!"
"A most beautiful future!"
That afternoon...
"Jean, don't be upset at me!"
"I don't love Albert"
My dear Jean, it's you I love.
here is your engagement ring.
Your Lucie.
"Thanks to your kiss, I Gracias a su beso, I've recovered my power!
Look... "
"I am a fairy!
Hundreds years ago a magician stole my powers away.
Only a young man's kiss could restore them... "
"Follow me: you shall be rewarded!"
"We are in the hospice for old fairies"
"Nowadays, nobody believes in fairies anymore.
So, my old sisters shut themselves up in this antrum. "
"They want you to kiss them... all!"
"Resign yourself!"
That one is Silvayne, a bad fairy.
Watch out, she is really evil!
"These are your old friends, Puss in Boots..."
"Bluebeard..."
"...
Cinderella and the Prínce... "
"Be happy, the fairies will give you immortality.
You're going to live with us forever! "
"I don't want to live forever, if Lucie is not with me!"
"Since you can't stay without her, we shall bring her here!"
"Look, your fiancée!"
"I wanted your friends to be here also!"
A fascinating life begins.
Thanks to the two sweethearts, an atmosphere of... tenderness permeates the old antrum of the fairies.
The evil Silvayne is jealous of Lucie.
I fear her power.
Lucie must leave.
"Take this as a keepsake.
With this ring, you must only... express a wish and it will come true! "
"If I accept to grant you the girl, you must solemnly promise something that will ensure her happiness!"
"Repeat: with all my heart, I want to be like a faithful dog for Lucie."
A DOG!
"We made it!
His oath transformed him!
Suddenly he turned into a dog! "
But where is Jean? NO DOGS ADMITTED.
Jean said we would meet here.
For the thief, the ring has lost its magic power.
"Don't wait for Jean.
This damned ring has turned him into a dog!
He's in your hands! "
"Jean, is it you?"
At midnight...
Through the power of imagination, with a normal ring, Jean has gained his self confidence. Look how he has changed.
THE END.
A German folk tale
Behold!
The portals of darkness are open, and the shadows of the dead hunt over the Earth...
"Back!
Hold!
Why dost thou scourge mankind with War, Plague, Famine?
! "
"The Earth is mine!"
"Never will the Earth be thine:
Man belongs to God! "
"Look below!"
"All things in heaven and on Earth are wonderful!
But the greatest wonder is man's freedom to choose between good and evil! "
"Dost thou know Faust?"
"A knave like all others!
He preaches good and does evil!
He seeks to turn base metal into gold!
Behold his greed! "
"A wager:
I will wrest Faust's soul away from God! "
"If thou canst destroy what is divine in Faust, the Earth is thine!"
"No man can resist evil!
The bet is on! "
"The Plague!
The Plague! "
The devastating pestilence raged:
in a few days half the town lay dying.
To find a cure for the Plague, Faust spent day and night in prayer with God.
And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house without its dead.
"Lord God, bless this act of redemption! Only you can alleviate our misery!"
"Help... help!
My mother is dying! "
Mortal terror and fear of death swept through the town.
"Repent, fast, pray!
Only Faith can vanquish death! "
"Have respect for the dead!"
"We still live, we still love!
We shall die dancing in each other's arms! "
"Who has faith shall live!
But death will take the sinners! "
"The Plague!
The Plague! "
"Compassion, Faust!
Only you can help us! "
"Get hence!
We are lost!
No faith is any help. No knowledge is any help.
All is vanity... "
Mine God, thou art merciful and a great goodness.
The third great Key to the Force of the Ghost of Hell.
And if thou would summon the Prince of Darkness to aid thee and give thee all the might and glory of the world, go to a crossroad and call on him three times.
"I invoke thy aid, Spirit of Darkness: show thyself!"
"Come forth, demon of evil!"
"As thou art called with thy unholy name:
MEPHISTO appear! "
"You have summoned me!"
"Here I am!"
I renounce God and his heavenly legion, and so shall be mine the power and glory of the world.
"Be gone from me, Satan!"
"To have the power to help for only one day!"
"One day!
Try it!
Just one trial day! "
"When the hour-glass has run out..."
"... you go free, the Pact canceled!
glory... power
"Can you help the hungry and the sick?"
"What you wish I will perform: you are the master and I am your servant."
"A drop of blood!"
"Blood is quite a remarkable substance!"
"Only for one day?"
"Until the sand has run out!"
"Faust!
Help us! "
"Then I shall help in the devil's name!"
"A miracle!
A miracle! "
"In the name of Christ crucified, help my child!"
"He cannot look upon the Holy Cross!"
"He is in league with the devil!
Stone him!
Stone him! "
"Deliver me, elixir of death!"
"You may not cheat me!
Remember our pact: the trial day is not over yet. "
"Death sets all men free!"
"Is that death?"
"It is life, Faust, seducing you with the fair image of your youth."
"Wretched Faust, why do you seek death? You have not yet lived!"
"I despise my life!"
"Your life was only the dust and mold of books!
Pleasure is all! "
"I am too old!"
"I offer you the greateast happiness: youth!
Seize it! "
"Give me youth!"
"I've caught you, old boy!"
"Take me to her!"
"Step upon my cloak..."
"... and the spinning Earth will spread before you!"
"The wedding feast for the Duchess of Parma, the most beautiful woman in Italy!"
"Strange guests!"
"To pay tribute to the highest beauty, my lord brings you his kingdom's treasures!"
"The day is over!
The sand has run out!
Be as you were! "
"Youth...
Leave me youth! "
"Our pact stands for eternity?"
"You have tasted all of life's pleasures, Faust!
From indulgence to indulgence, sensation without end, yet nothing satisfied you! "
"What will you: a woman, a game of chance, an orgy?
Whatever you wish, I must grant! "
"Do you want the Emperor's crown?"
"Home!"
"Take me home!
And at once! "
"Is today a feast day in your town?"
"Are you heathen born that you have never heard of Holy Easter?"
"It is as if life had stood still:
All is as it once was! "
"An innocent little girl, running to a priest...
she is not for you! "
"Tedeum laudamus Praise the Lord."
"Vacation, mother!"
"I know more obliging wenches. for you here!"
"I want only her.
Do as I command! "
"Brother Valentin!"
"Once she has this little golden chain in the house she will begin to feel the devil's power!"
"Good gracious, how pretty you are!"
"Any lovers yet?"
"What have you, child?"
"Tell the mother of God, if you cannot tell me!"
"May I visit Aunt Marthe?"
Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein
"Three little drops from this love potion by night and all the girls' hearts will be yours!"
"Look Aunt Marthe what I found in my drawer..."
"A rich treasure!"
"I found it in my jewelry box!"
"Just once let me try on the beautiful necklace!"
"A small bouquet for the bridegroom, a little wreath for the bride!"
"Pardon, lovely lady. I seek Frau Marthe Schwerdtlein!"
"From your cousin... from Lombardy...!"
"He gave me this necklace as a gift for you!"
"Those we encircle within this ring shall be sweethearts...!"
"One, two, three. Makes you free!"
"Pardon: my stomach is too weak for such a fiery drink!"
"Permit, that I mix myself a litle drink as I learned it in Padua!"
"My friend, a prince of the noblest blood!"
"He loves me loves me not loves me..."
"Yes, with all his heart he loves you!"
"She loves me..." "She loves me not."
"She loves you!"
"I am yours forever!"
"He loves me!"
"What are you waiting for?
Your sweetheart herself lights the way for you! "
"Cursed matchmaker!"
"I will keep the brother out of the way!"
"To the prettiest girl in town!"
"No other girl is as pretty as your sister:
long live Gretchen! "
"A pretty girl is not pure!"
"Here's to Gretchen!"
"Here's to your Gretchen!"
"If you hurry you can catch her lover before he slips out of her room."
"Flee!... Flee!
... you have murdered him! "
"Murder!"
"Murder... murder!"
"Murder...
Murder...
Murder! "
"Flee!
...
Flee!
The deputes already seek the murderer! "
"Touch me not, you wanton, your lover has slain me!"
"First read a requiem. Mass for me!
Then to the stocks with this harlot! "
"Gretchen...
Gretchen! "
"Now death and nature with surprise Behold the trembling sinners rise To meet the Judge's searching eyes."
"For now before the Judge severe No crime can pass unpunished here."
"All hidden things must plain appear."
"Mother!
Mother! "
"And has born a little child in the depth of winter."
"Have mercy on my child!"
"Are you not Gretchen, who stood in the stocks?"
"Mercy!
Mercy!
My child is dying! "
"She has killed her child! Seize her, the murderess!"
"Faust...
Faust... help your Gretchen! "
"Mephisto!"
"You have betrayed me!
She suffers! She suffers! "
"To the stake with the child murderer!"
"Save her, save Gretchen!"
"Too late!
Even now they build her funeral pyre! "
"You are still my servant!
Bring me to her, or the pact is broken! "
"My steed awaits!
Quick, before morning comes! "
"Faster!
Faster! "
"Oh had I never wished for youth, that brought this misery!
Curse... curse the delusion of youth! "
"You have yourself cursed youth!
What you wish I must grant! "
"Be as you were: an old man!"
"Forgive... forgive me my sin!"
"Here is no place for thee!"
"I claim my wager!"
"One Word breaks thy pact!"
"Tell me the Word!"
"The Word that wings joyfully throughout the universe, The Word that appeases every pain and grief, The Word that expiates all human guilt, the Eternal Word... dost thou not know it?"
"Tel me the Word!"

The Yukon
The gold rush has brought them to this desert coast
The Irishman Michael Dennin (Vladimir Fogel)
The chairman Hans Nelson, (Sergei Komarov) a Swede
Nelson's wife, the Englishwoman Edith (Aleksandra Khokhlova)
Shareholder Dutchy (Porfiri Podobed)
Shareholder Harky (Pyotr Galadzhev)
There's no gold in this mine - we have to look elsewhere.
Go, Dennin, collect the instruments - we are moving!
The company's gold mine
Gold.
Gold.
The company's success lasted throughout the winter.
Small house - great fortune!
The output of gold continued...
I was the one who found the gold and they make me their washer woman!
Spring came slowly.
Lunch
Dennin won't be joining us - he is no longer hungry. He lost his appetite due to envy!
Your health, Mister Dennin!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it...
He's alive.
Not without the law - it's a white man!
The weather changed abruptly.
One inch per hour.
I'll kill you all some day anyway!
He's dead...
The two graves are ready - if the Yukon doesn't flood them.
The two murder victims make their way... through the storm and darkness to their burial chambers.
After the storm the top of the frozen Yukon was left covered with water.
Days went by in a tormenting silence.
Man or woman - one of them always sat... next to the criminal.
Kill me!
Give me something to drink!
The ice on the Yukon began to break
Daytime.
Night.
Daytime again.
What do you intend to do with me?
We will treat you by the law.
I am so tired, so tired...
The tobacco is running out.
Give me back my tobacco!
Not without the law!
Edith's birthday came.
Don't be afraid!
Take it out!
It's for you - a birthday present...
Shave me...
Shave him already!
Today is my birthday!
Why did you do that?
It seemed so terribly simple to me.
And you always said, I would end up on the gallows!
Days went by... but it could not have been predicted... that the law would arrive earlier... than in a few weeks.
Let's pronounce judgement.
Not today, today is sunday!
The Queen of England
Edith insisted... that the procedure... should follow English law... since the criminal... was one of the Queen's subjects.
Accused, you are an Irishman... and therefore we will pass judgement over you... in the name of Queen Victoria.
The Judges
The Witnesses
The Jurors
The Verdict
Michael Dennin, by the Queen's law you shall be hanged by the neck... until you are dead.
Dead... dead...
I spoke well.
Like in a real court...
And now it's all over.
They say death is not agonising...
The designated time came.
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy upon us!
I couldn't have done a better job if I had had to make it for you, Hans!
The Execution
May God... accept you, repentant sinner!
Here - For good luck!

You, I see... in the service of the capital
More machines
And more
And even more
But for the worker it is just as... just as... difficult
I see... colonies

Colonies

Slaves
Black people... existing for amusement as
Chocolate kids
The capital
Toys
Canons
Hatred
Convulsions
On the brink of historical downfall... the capital... celebrates
You, bathing sheep in the waves of the sea
And you, bathing sheep in the stream
You
in the Auls in Dagestan
You
in the Siberian taiga
You
to not get lost
You... in the tundra
On the Pechora River
In the ocean
And you... who discarded the capital's authority in October... and opened up the way to a new life... for the country's oppressed
You
Tatars
You
Buryats
Uzbeks
Kalmyks
Khakases
Mountain dwellers from the Caucasus
You, Komi, from the Komi district
And you from the distant Aul
You... at the reindeer races
And you... at the feast of the Goat Slaughter
At the signal of the steamer
At the zurna and the drum
You with the grapes
And you at the rice
You, eating raw reindeer meat You, drinking from mother's breast
And you, lusty centenarian
You mother, playing with your child
You child, playing with the captured arctic fox
You, unleashing the reindeer
You, doing the laundry with your feet
And you, sitting in the audience
You... knee-deep in grain
Knee-deep in water
You, spinning your flax in the spinning room
You, spinning your wool in the mountains
You... all... are the masters... of the Soviet... land
In your hands lies... the sixth... part... of the world
From the Kremlin... to the Chinese border
From the Matochkin Strait... to Bukhara
From Novorossiysk... to Leningrad
From the lighthouse at the Arctic Circle... to the Caucasus Mountains
From the golden eagle on the arm of the Kyrgyz... to the eider on the cliffs of the Arctic Ocean... to the owls of the North... to the seagulls of the Black Sea
All... are in your... hands
Yours
Yours are... the buffalo
The goats at the Ulu-Usen river
The camels on the steps of Kyrgyztan
The reindeer
The Sibirian squirrel
The Arctic Fox in the trap
The marten
The brown bear
The sable of the High North
The Karakul sheep
All... are yours
Your factories
Your plants
Your oil
Your cotton
And the sheep
The wool
The wool
The wool
Your fat
The fish
Your flax
Your tabacco
And your immense wealth... are yours
Along every path in the Soviet Union roll goods for export
Over country roads
Over mountain paths
And with camel caravans
And there... where the buffalo are harnessed to the carts
There, where nomads lead their herds
There... where the herds cross the river
There, where fruits are packed into boxes
There... where the Vogul unties the knot with his teeth
There, where flax for export... is brought to the harbour
GOSTORG (State Trade Organisation)
Where cisterns and reservoirs are filled with sunflower oil
Where caviar is freighted
The cattle
The cement
Where the grain... in an endless stream... flows into foreign freighters
And there... where not one single path leads
Where, over a distance of thousands of versts... one does not meet a single person
In the severe frost
In the snow banks of the endless tundra... they fight their way to the State Trade Organisation's nearest collecting point... to deliver their prey... for export into capitalist countries
Far away... in the Arctic Circle... where the sun does not set for half the year... and nighttime lasts for half the year... the Samoyedes sit motionless... and look intensely towards the ocean
Every year steamers from the State Trade Organisation come to them at Novaya Zemlya... with dogs... with flour... with wood... with textiles
The Samoyedes are guests of the sailors
On the gramophone they hear Lenin himself
After 24 hours the steamer leaves again... and takes fur with it... and these furs arrive at the Leipzig Fair
and in the capitalist country... the furs, captured by Tungus, Ostyaks and Samoyedes, are traded for machines for the Soviet Union... for machines that produce other machines
Thus the land of the proletarian dictatorship... and even the people still living in patriarchy... by extension of the State Trade... as far as these people may live... builds up socialism
Together with medium and small farmers, bringing their grain to the cooperative... together with the farmers who receive a tractor from the cooperative... for the collective cultivation of the soil
Together with the male workers in the socialist plant
Together with the female workers in the socialist factory
The Black Sea
The Black Sea
And your Ship frozen in the Baltic Sea by the shore
Frozen in the ice
And one disappearing into the icy, unknown distance
Here and there they dig up the earth with a stick
Here and there there are still women with veiled faces
Some still recite the rosary
Some act crazy
Somewhere the shaman performs his magic
There are still places... where a youth ritual is carried out for women
There are still places... where they still make sacrifices to the god Menkva
Slowly the old is disappearing... like you disappear into the icy distance
Still they believe in the help of Muhammad
Still they believe in the help of Christ
In the help of Buddha
Or like the Tungus
I see you...
Black Sea... and your ship frozen in the Baltic Sea by the shore
Frozen in the ice
And you... lcebreaker Lenin
You break the ice with your chest
We pave the way... for our freighters... to trade our grain... to trade our furs... for needed machines
For machines that produce other machines... which in turn accelerate the growth... of our own... production... of machines
I see... a woman, who has abandoned the veil
Another woman, who works under the women of the East
A Samoyedic komsomol reading the newspaper The Nordic
Buryats and Mongols reading the Buryat-Mongolic Pravda
Mongol children joining a pioneer battalion
For the support of the reindeer breeders a polar laboratory is being founded
Irrigation canals are being built... via waterless steps
The electric light bulb enters the farmers house
A reading house
Ostrivsky
- Reading house
- Library
And a radio presentation
Volchovstroy
Plants... and more plants
I see... that we want to produce... not only calico... but also the machines, needed to produce calico
We want to produce... not only tractors... but also the machines, needed to produce tractors
We build... in our country... a complete... socialist... society
We are a hub... for the workers of the West
A hub... for the people of the East... who stand up to fight... against the yoke of the Capital
Oppressed countries... gradually leaving the world capital
They will pour forth into the stream of the united socialist economy
into the stream... of the united... socialist... economy

The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marrietta, Ga., in the Spring 1861.
There were two loves in his live.
His engine, And--
"Fort Sumter has been fired upon."
"Then the war is here."
"Yes, dad, and I'm going to be one of the first to enlist."
"Aren't you going to enlist?"
"Your name?"
"Occupation?"
"Engineer on the Western and Atlantic Railroad."
"Don't enlist him.
He is more valuable to the South as an engineer. "
"We can't use you."
"Occupation?"
"Bartender."
"If you lose this war don't blame me."
"Did Johnnie enlist?"
"He didn't even get in line."
"He's a disgrace to the South.
"Why didn't you enlist?"
"They wouldn't take me."
"Please don't lie.
I don't want you to speak to me again until you are in uniform.
A year later.
In a Union encampment just North of Chattanooga.
General Thatcher, and his chief spy, Captain Anderson.
"I Know every foot of this railroad from Marietta to Chattanooga, and with ten picked men I cannot fail."
"We will enter the South as civilians coming from the neutral state of Kentucky to join the southern cause."
"At Big Shanty we will steal the train while the passengers and the crew are at dinner, and proceeding North we will burn every bridge, cutting off the supplies of the army now facing you."
"Then the day you steal the train I will have General Parker advance to meet you."
"As soon as I arrive I will let you know how seriously father is wounded."
"Big Shanty.
Twenty minutes for dinner. "
"Three men stole my General.
I think they are deserters. "
"Why not stop and fight them?"
"I'm afraid they have us greatly outnumbered."
The Southern army facing Chattanooga is ordered to retreat. "
General Parker's victorious Northern army advancing.
"There is only one man on that engine."
In the enemy's country, hopelessly lost, helplessly cold and horribly hungry.
"At Nine o'clock tomorrow morning our supply trains will meet and unite with General Parker's army at the Rock River bridge."
"Then the army, backed by our supply trains, will advance for a surprise attack on the rebels left flank."
"Once our trains and troops cross that bridge, nothing on the earth can stop us."
"This girl was in the baggage car when we stole the train, so I thought it best to hold her."
"We had better stay here until daybreak to see where we are."
"It was so brave of you to risk your life, coming into the enemy's country, just to save me."
After a nice, quiet, refreshing night's rest.
"We've got to get back to our lines somehow and warn them of this coming attack."
"I will get that spy before he reaches the Southern lines.
You follow with the supply trains as planned. "
"We must pick up more firewood."
The Rock River bridge.
The Northern division nearing the bridge to meet the supply trains.
"That bridge is not burned enough to stop you, and my men will ford the river."
Heroes of the day.
"Is that your uniform?"
"I had to wear it to get through the lines."
"Take it off!"
"Enlist the lieutenant."
"Occupation?"
"Soldier."
This song of the Man and his Wife is of no place and every place:
you might hear it anywhere at any time.
For wherever the sun rises and sets in the city's turmoil or under the open sky on the farm life is much the same:
sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet
Summertime... vacation time
Among the vacationists was a Woman of the City.
Several weeks had passed since her coming and still she lingered.
"They used to be like children, carefree...
always happy and laughing... "
"Now he ruins himself for the woman from the city - Money-lenders strip the farm -"
"Now he ruins himself for the woman from the city - Money-lenders strip the farm - and his wife sits alone."
"Tell me! You are all mine?"
"Sell your farm...

"Couldn't she get
"... then overturn the boat... it will look like an accident."
"Leave this behind...
come to the City! "
"COME TO THE CITY!"
"... after the boat has capsized, save yourself with these bulrushes."
"The rushes will hold you up. Scatter them before you reach the shore and tell everyone she drowned by accident."
"We're going for a trip across the water.
I may not be back for quite a while. "
"Don't be afraid of me!"
"Don't be afraid of me!"
"God is giving you, in the holy blonds of matrimony, a trust.
She is young... and inexperienced. Guide her and love her... "
"... keep and protect her from all harm."
"Wilt thou LOVE her?"
"Forgive me!"
"Manicure?"
"You'd look grand with a high polish!"
"Come again!"
"Thank you!
And you must come and see us some time. "
"Congratulations! She is the sweetest bride I've seen this year."
"FARMERS! If you want to sell your home and move to the city-- - We Pay Cash!"
"Hit the hole...

THE WORKERS 'AND PEASANTS' REVOLUTION HAS WON
The End
THE DOCKS OF NEW YORK
The waterfront of New York - the end of many journeys, the beginning of many adventures.
Miles of docks wait day and night for strange cargo - and stranger men.
Ships come in from the sea - tarrying a day or two in the endless journey from port to port.
These were the days before oil fuel made stoking a lady's job - when stokers earned their pay in sweat and coal-dust.
"Well, Bill!
We brought the ol 'barge in right on time! "
"Pick up that waste!
Nobody goes ashore till this hole is cleaned up! "
"This packet sails tomorrow morning."
"You've got one night ashore.
If any o 'you muckers come back drunk, you'll do double shift! "
"He's the most even- tempered guy I ever knew - always sore!"
"He thinks we're goin 'ashore to play marbles!"
The Sandbar, a cable's length from the wharf, has vanished now - wiped out by commerce and reform.
But that night it was wide awake and roaring.
Save his soul and money comes to Hymn-Book Harry
"Meet my husband!"
"Well, Andy!
I guess you never expected to run across me here! "
Night and fog met the stokers coming ashore.
"Hey, Bill!
That's no place to take a lady! "
"Come on, Bill.
They'll take care of her! "
"Okay, Bill!
Be a hero an 'leave your pal! "
"But just remember Singapore - - an 'recollect Shanghai!"
"Well, you gave me the air.
It's been three years - what did you expect me to do? "
"Take that out o 'here - before you draw the police!"
"Get her a hot drink!"
"One hot toddy!"
"You're not goin 'in there!
That's the only rag she had to her back! "
"So you're the guy that saved my life?"
"You could have saved yourself the trouble, an 'let me die."
"All right!
Make believe you died - make believe you're startin 'all over again! "
"You left all that slush in the river, Baby.
All you need is a good time! "
"I've had too many good times."
"You ain't never been out with Bill Roberts."
"Dry up before you catch cold!"
"Would you care?"
"Well, I might..."
"After a month in the stoke-hole, I got no sympathy for anybody that wants to quit a swell world like this!"
"Throw yourself into them new rags an 'give me a chance!"
"All right, Bill Roberts, I'll give you a chance."
"Anyway, I can always make a hole in the water."
"Are you goin 'to let me have a good time in my own quiet way - or must I take this place apart?"
"Thought you might want your tie - Bill."
"Pretty, ain't she?"
"You better take my tip - an 'stay away from that dame!"
"Shove off, my lad!
I want to talk with your lady friend. "
"You may be big game aboard ship, but you're only an animal-cracker here."
"Gee, but you're strong!"
"I guess you've known a lot o 'girls."
"I ain't braggin 'about my love-affairs."
"I'm not braggin ', either."
"Ever been married, Bill?"
"Say, who'd marry a guy like me?"
"Oh, I don't know. A lot o 'girls might."
"You ever been married, Baby?"
"Say, who'd marry a girl like me?"
"I've sailed the seven seas, but I never saw a craft as trim as you."
"I don't think it's fair of you to kid me."
"Say!
What makes you think I'm kiddin '? "
"What did you ever do that makes you worse than me?
I'd marry you in a minute! "
"An 'come to think of it, I'll marry you right now!"
"You don't know Bill Roberts!
I'll try anything once! "
"Get me a parson - I'm goin 'to get spliced to my girl friend!"
"Come back here, Bill - don't make a fool o 'yourself!"
"Meet the bride!"
"I better get Hymn-Book Harry - before he wrecks the place!"
"I'm goin 'to do right by our Nell!
I'm goin 'to marry her - here an' now! "
"Do you think he can make you decent by marrying 'you?"
"I don't know what to think, any more."
"Until I got married, I was decent!"
"We'll give you a marriage you'll never forget!"
"Where's your license?"
"Are you goin 'to queer our fun just because you got to have a little piece o' paper?"
"If you got to have a license, Bill will get one first thing in the morning."
"Won't you, Bill?"
"Word of honor, Parson.
First thing in the morning! "
"Let the old fusser go!
I'll marry you. "
"If any of you eggs know why these heels shouldn't get hitched, speak now or forever after hold your trap!"
"Does it mean that much to you?"
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the sight of God and in the face of this company -"
"- to join this Man, and this Woman, in Holy Matrimony."
"Matrimony is an honorable estate.... and is not to be entered into lightly -"
"Do you take this woman to be your wedded wife?"
"Will you love her, comfort her, honor her, and keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others -- as long as you both shall live?"
"Sure, I will!"
"I will."
"Give me the ring."
"Here's mine
- I hope it does you more good than it did me! "
"Here's your wages, Parson.
Easy come, easy go! "
"I expect you to bring me the license in the morning.
Pay me then. "
"What's the meanin 'of this jamboree?"
"Oh, I thought I'd get married, and settle down."
"But how are you goin 'to get rid of her?"
"Who says I want to get rid of her?"
"I know you, Bill Roberts!
You might fool her, but you can't fool me! "
"What lady threw that shoe?"
"You don't know what this means to me, Bill!"
"I'll be a good wife, Bill."
Morning.
"Got a match, Chief?"
"I s'pose you've forgot all about last night?"
"Wasn't you never young, Chief?
I was just havin 'a good time! "
"I s'pose you've forgot about gettin 'married, too."
"Chief, last night's over.
Today's another day! "
"Mebbe for you, but not for me.
That sock in the jaw will cost you your job! "
"One ship's as good as another, Chief.
Any port in a storm! "
"Get out o 'here - or my husband will kill you!"
"Don't kid me!"
"Don't let Bill Roberts stand between you an 'me - you know he ain't comin' back!"
"You're a dirty liar!
He is comin 'back! "
"Rustle that stretcher - this guy's in bad shape!"
"You won't get nowhere keeping 'your mouth shut!"
"I warned you!
Now beat it - while you got time! "
"I'm her husband."
"She didn't shoot him.
The kid wouldn't hurt a fly! "
"I shot him, an 'nobody else is goin' to get the credit for it."
"I'm his wife. He gave me the air once too often!"
"Why didn't you say so before?"
"I didn't care - before."
"I hope you have better luck than me - - but I doubt it."
"I didn't figure on your comin 'back to help me."
"You didn't need my help, Baby."
"Goin 'away - Bill?"
"Sorry, Baby.
Sailin 'in an hour - - I never missed a ship in my life. "
"Could you give me a minute to - to get used to it, Bill?"
"I never even thanked you for pulling 'me out o' the water."
"That's all right!"
"An 'I never thanked you for them swell clothes you bought me."
"That's all right, too."
"An 'I guess you expect me to thank you for bein' decent enough to make me your wife."
"Now listen, kid - you can't get me sore!
I never did a decent thing in my life. "
"I've always been like this.
There ain't no power on earth that could ever keep me ashore! "
"Why get serious about it, anyway?
You knew all I had was one night ashore - you knew I was just a dirty stoker! "
"You ain't so bad, Bill Roberts!"
"But it would have been kind o 'funny if this had been on the level - even for a couple o' months."
"Maybe if I ever stayed ashore for as long as a couple o 'months I'd get to like it."
"Get a move on, Bill.
Time's up! "
"So long, Baby."
"Well - goodbye
- Bill. "
"Come on out o 'this - before you get into another mess!"
"I'll fix it for you, Bill.
You can't go to sea like this. "
"What are you tryin 'to do - bring me more bad luck?"
"Superstitious, are you?"
"The nerve of that dame - bawling me out after all I done for her!"
"I could of told you before that she was no good - like all females!"
"Lucky for you I happened along!
If I hadn't pried you loose, she'd of stuck like a barnacle! "
"Buck into it, you two!
I want steam, not talk! "
"I'll have you put in irons for this!"
"Where's my wife?"
"In jail, where she belongs."
"What's she in jail for?"
"Why don't you go to the Night Court an 'find out?"
"Thirty days.
Next case! "
"You are charged with having in your possession clothes stolen from the Harbor Pawn Shop."
"How did you get them?"
"My husband gave them to me."
"Where is your husband?"
"He left me this morning."
"How long have you been married?"
"I was married last night."
"Thirty days.
Next case! "
"Just a minute, Captain!
I'm her husband.
I pinched them duds myself! "
"Break in anywhere - take anything you want - - that's your idea, I suppose?"
"No, sir, I rung the bell!
But there wasn't no answer, so I helped myself. "
"I see - man of importance - no time to waste.
Just what was your hurry? "
"Well sir, I'm a stoker.
I only had one night ashore, an 'I wanted to have a good time. "
"Sixty days will slow you down.
Release the woman.
Next case! "
"Sixty days ain't a long cruise, Baby - an 'it'll be my last one, if you'll wait.
"I guess I'd wait forever, Bill."
Hollywood - 1928!
The Magic Empire of the Twentieth Century!
The Mecca of the World!
To this Hollywood had come Leo Andreyev, a Russian director...
"Every Russian in Hollywood is in that stack!"

"Quit your shoving '!

"One Corporal!"
"One General!"
"Quit shaking 'your head!
How do you expect me to make up? "
"Excuse me, please...
I can't help it...
I... I had a great shock once! "
"Where'd you get the gadget from... steal it out of a hock shop?"
"The Czar gave it to me."
"What do you know about that?
The Czar gave him this beautiful medal! "
"I'm your pal...
I want to show it to everybody... "
Imperial Russia - 1917.
Proud, majestic, haughty...
seemingly eternal at the ages!
On a dozen far-flung battle fronts, Russia was engaged in a death grapple with the enemy.
Tireless in the defense of a crumbling empire was the Grand Duke Sergius Alexander, cousin to the Czar and Commanding General of the Russian Armies.
"Everything is in perfect order, Your Imperial Highness There is no need for you to tire yourself with an inspection."
"The revolutionists have intercepted most of our supplies."
"Let him strut a little longer!
His day are numbered! "
"The days of all who are dragging Russia down are numbered!"
"Only a few weeks more... but they seem an eternity!"
"We have waited too long to be impatient now!"
"You are ordered to report for passport examination in the morning."
"They are actors playing for the troops and their pasports are in order but our reports show they are revolutionists..."
"... she is Natalie Dabrova, the most dangerous revolutionist in Russia!"
"Let's have them up!
He's dangerous enough and she's pretty enough... to merit my personal attention! "
"The second time this week you've worn my coat and smoked my cigarettes!"
"If he does it again remove the coat and shoot the contents!"
"So you two are serving your country... by acting!"
"A fine patriotic service... when Russia is fighting for her life!"
"Why aren't you in uniform?"
"My lungs are weak."
"Perhaps it is your courage that is weak!"
"It doesn't require courage to send others to battle and death!"
"Put him under arrest!"
"What is this man to you?"
"Nothing at all.
He is Leo Andreyev... the director of the Kief Imperial Theatre. "
"Orders from the General Staff, Your Imperial Highness!"
"You will, of course, honor us with your company?"
The new Headquarters.
HIS MAJESTY THE CZAR WILL VISIT YOUR HEADQUARTERS THIS AFTERNOON TO INSPECT THE TROOPS
"Recall a division from the front His Majesty thinks the war is a parlor game."
"We can't spare a division...
we need every man! "
"Don't argue!
Have a division deloused and re-equipped... and send it here immediately! "
And so, with the flames of war crackling along a two-thousand mile front, troops bitterly needed to defend Russia played parade for the Czar.
"Your Imperial Highness, you are urgently needed to dispatch instructions!"
"The show will be over in a minute!"
"Russia relies on you, dear cousin."
After a week... after thousands of men had spilled their blood to defend a few inches of earth...
"Where is the lady?"
"I beg you to accept this expession of gratitude for your company."
"That sort of thing should always be done after caviar!"
"The General Staff, Your Imperial Highness!"
"Hiss Majesty plans to visit the front tomorrow!
It might be advisable to stage an offensive for him in the morning...
not too early! "
"My troops are not prepared for an offensive!
...... I will not sacrifice them merely for the entertainment of the Czar! "
"That's what provides fuel for the revolution!"
"Can't you see the man is very ill?"
"I'll show you dirty revolutionary dogs!"
"Aren't you taking a terrific risk in defying the Czar's wishes?"
"I would take any risk to prevent a needless sacrifice."
"Then why do you continue this stupid war?"
"We must have victory!
...... Defeat means revolution... and the collapse of Russia! "
"Then you love Russia so much?"
"I would gladly die tonight... if it would help Russia!"
"Before you die... won't you at least have coffee with me... in my room?"
"You are very beautiful!
One could easily fall in love with you! "
"Your hand is trembling!"
"Will you get me my cigarettes, please?
Yours are so strong! "
"Why didn't you shoot?"
"I don't know why I didn't kill you..."
I suppose it was because I couldn't kill... anyone who loves Russia as much as you do! "
"From now on you are my prisoner of war..."
"... and my prisoner of love."
A group of obscure people meet to decide the fate of Russia.
"Train Number 476, carrying the Grand Duke Sergius Alexander and staff, has left for the front!"
"Communicate with our agents at once!
Tonight Russia becomes a republic! "
"If we get the right news at the next station His Imperial Highness will long remember this ride!"
"His Imperial Highness will be here in five minutes!
...... Let's give him the greatest reception he has ever had! "
"All out, Masters of Russia!
Last stop! "
"We have been slaves too long!
Now we are the masters! "
"I'll be your servant just once more!
...... I'll place the noose around your neck myself! "
"This is the end, Your Imperial Highness It is our turn now!"
"Let's hang him in Petrograd... for all the world to see!"
"Look at him!...
The greatest man in Russia greatest even than the Czar! "
"Make him sweat as we have sweated!
...... Make him stoke our train to Petrograd! "
"Would His Imperial Highness care for one of his cigarettes?"
"To the locomotive!"
"That woman belongs to me...
she goes with the coat! "
"Don't you understand?
It was the only way I could save your life. "
"I love you!"
"These pearls will pay your way out of Russia!"
"I love you!
I love you! "
And so the backwash of a tortured nation had carried still another extra to Hollywood.
"Get the extra people on the stage!"
"The director has an important part for you, Pop.
You've got to look nice! "
"Is that beard supposed to be Russian?
It looks like an ad for cough drops! "
"In Russia, that was worn on the left side.
I know because I was a general. "
"I've made twenty Russian pictures.
You can't tell me anything about Russia! "
"Get me a whip!"
"I have waited ten years for this moment, Your Imperial Highness."
"The same coat, the same uniform, the same man only the times have changed!"
"This is supposed to be a trench scene of troops just before a battle..."
"You are the General in command!"
"The troops are tired of war... tired of listening to our pretty speeches..."
"One of them becomes violent...
you strike him with this whip! "
"We won't have to rehearse that scene... I know you can use a whip!"
"Music please... the Russian National Anthem."
"Wind machine!"
"Lights!"
"Camera!"
"What's the difference who wins this war?...
We're sick and tired of fighting... "
"You've given your last command!
A new day is here!
Down with your Russia!
"People of Russia, you are being led by traitors we must win or Russia will perish!"
"The command is forward... to victory..."
"Long Live Russia!"
"Have we won?"
"Yes, Your Imperial Highness... you have won!"
"Tough luck!
That guy was a great actor. "
"He was more than a great actor... he was a great man."

THE END
THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC
A film by Carl Th.
Dreyer
At the Bibliotheque de la Chambre des Deputes in Paris resides one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world:
The record of the trial of Joan of Arc, the trial that ended in her death.
The questions of the judges and Joan's responses were recorded exactly.
Reading it, we discover the real Joan, not in armor, but simple and human... a young woman who died for her country. And we are witness to an amazing drama:
A young, pious woman, confronted by a group of orthodox theologians and powerful judges.
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... nothing but the truth...
In France I'm called Joan... in my village, I'm called Jeannette.
How old are you?
Nineteen... I think.
Do you know the Lord's Prayer?
Who taught it to you?
My mother.
Will you recite it?
You claim to be sent by God?
To save France... it's why I was born.
So you think God hates the English?
I don't know if God loves or hates the English... but I do know that the English will all be chased from France... except those that die here!
You have said that St. Michael appeared to you... in what form?
Did he have wings?
Did he wear a crown?
How was he dressed?
How did you know if it was a man or a woman?
Was he naked?
Do you think God was unable to clothe him?
Did he have long hair?
Why would he have cut it?
Why do you wear men's clothing?
If we give you women's clothing, would you wear it?
When the mission that God has entrusted to me is over, I will again dress as a woman.
So it is God who orders you to dress as a man?
And what reward do you expect from Our Lord?
The salvation of my soul.
You blaspheme God.
This is disgraceful.
For me, she is a saint.
Has God made you promises?
That has nothing to do with your trial.
Shouldn't we let the judges decide that?
Shall we put this question to a vote?
So!
What has God promised you?
Perhaps that you will be delivered from prison?
When?
I know neither the day... nor the hour.
Since she couldn't be made to confess easily, we will have to be clever.
Go find a letter bearing the signature of King Charles.
Write the letter that I will dictate.
I have great pity for you!
Do you know the signature of your King?
I have a letter from him to you.
I can't read.
To our beloved Joan...
I am preparing to march on Rouen with a mighty army.
I send you this devoted priest, have confidence in him.
Just as Jesus is the son of God, you claim to be the daughter of God?
Will you now recite the Lord's Prayer?
God has told you that you shall be delivered from prison?
