The Parties to the Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade ( hereinafter referred to as &quot; the Agreement &quot; ) ,

In such cases a developing country Party to the Agreement may request before the end of the period referred to in Article 21 ( 1 ) an extension of such period , it being understood that the Parties to the Agreement will give sympathetic consideration to such a request in cases where the developing country in question can show good cause ;

Recognize that developing countries which currently value goods on the basis of officially established minimum values may wish to make a reservation to enable them to retain such values on a limited and transitional basis under such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the Parties to the Agreement ;

7 . Agree that Article 17 recognizes that in applying the Agreement , customs administrations may need to make enquiries concerning the truth or accuracy of any statement , document or declaration presented to them for customs valuation purposes .

ARRANGEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argentine Republic on trade in mutton and lamb
Letter No 1
Sir ,
I have the honour to refer to the negotiations recently undertaken between our respective delegations for the purpose of drawing up provisions concerning import into the European Economic Community of mutton , lamb and goatmeat from Argentina , on connection with implementation by the Community of the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat .
During these negotiations both parties agreed as follows : 1 .
This arrangement shall relate to : - fresh or chilled mutton , lamb and goatmeat ( 02.01 A IV a ) ) ,
- frozen mutton , lamb and goatmeat ( 02.01 A IV b ) ) .
2 .
Within the terms of this arrangement , the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Argentina to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity : 20 000 tonnes expressed in carcass weight ( 1 ) .
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the arrangement , Argentina undertakes to implement the appropriate procedures to ensure that the annual quantity actually exported does not exceed the quantity agreed and shall be exported in accordance with the traditional patterns of presentation ( frozen or chilled ) .
Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade , the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution .
3 .
Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause , it undertakes that Argentina &apos;s access into the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected .
4 .
If imports in any one year exceed the quantities agreed , the Community reserves the right to suspend imports from Argentina for the remainder of that year .
The quantity overshipped shall be offset against Argentina &apos;s export entitlement for the following year .
The Community undertakes to limit the levy applicable to imports of products covered by the present arrangement to a maximum amount of 10 % , ad valorem . ( 1 ) Carcass weight ( bone-in equivalent weight ) .
By this term is understood the weight of bone-in meat presented as such as well as boned meat converted by a coefficient into bone-in weight . For this purpose 55 kg of boned mutton corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in mutton and 60 kg of boned lamb corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in lamb .
6 .
At the time of accession of new Member States , the Community , in consultation with Argentina , will alter the quantities set out in paragraph 2 , in accordance with Argentina &apos;s trade with each new Member State .
The charges applicable to imports for the said new Member States shall be fixed in accordance with rules in the Treaty of Accession ; the maximum level of the levy specified in point 5 of this arrangement being taken into account .
The total quantity as mentioned in clause 2 above is fixed at 23 000 tonnes in carcass weight as from the date of accession of Greece to the Community .
7 .
The Community will endeavour to avoid any market development which could prejudice the marketing of Argentina &apos;s mutton and lamb on the Community market within the limits of the quantities agreed .
In particular , the Community will take steps to ensure that the disposal of intervention stocks in frozen form arising from the operation of the regulation does not undermine such marketing of Argentina &apos;s mutton and lamb .
8 .
In taking account of the objectives and provisions of this arrangement the Community agrees that any actual implementation of refunds or any other form of assistance with respect to exports of mutton , lamb and live sheep and lamb intended for slaughter will apply only at prices and on conditions which comply with existing international obligations and in respect of the traditional shares of the Community of world export trade in these products .
These words shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of GATT and in particular in conformity with Article 10 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade .
9 .
Argentina shall ensure that this arrangement is observed , in particular , by issuing export certificates covering the products referred to in paragraph 1 within the limits of the quantities covered by this arrangement .
For its part , the Community shall undertake to adopt all necessary provisions to make the issue of the import certificates for the products referred to above , originating in Argentina , subject to the presentation of an export certificate , issued by the competent authority designated by the Argentine Government .
Detailed rules for applying this system shall be laid down in such a way as to render unnecessary the lodging of a security for the issue of the import certificate in respect of the products in question .
Also , such detailed rules of application shall provide that the competent Argentine authority shall communicate periodically to the competent authority of the Community the quantities in respect of which export certificates are issued , broken down , where appropriate , according to destination .
10 .
A consultative committee shall be set up composed of representatives from the Community and from Argentina .
The Committee shall ensure that the arrangement is being properly applied and is functioning smoothly .
It will examine regularly the trend of the two parties &apos; markets in mutton and lamb and goatmeat and the trend of the international market , as well as marketing conditions on those markets including those relevant to the objective set out in clause 7 of this arrangement .
It will ensure that the proper application of the arrangement is not affected by the export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat-based products to the Community under customs headings not referred to by the arrangement .
The Committee will discuss all questions which could arise in applying the arrangement and will recommend appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
11 .
The provisions of this arrangement shall be agreed without prejudice to the parties &apos; rights and obligations under GATT .
12 .
The annual quantity fixed in clause 2 refers to the period running from 1 January to 31 December .
The quantity applicable as of the implementation of the present arrangement and until 1 January of the following year will be fixed on a pro rata basis in relation to the total annual quantity and will take into account the seasonality of the trade .
13 .
This arrangement shall apply , on the one hand , to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and , on the other hand , to the territory of the Argentine Republic .
14 .

Letter No 1
Sir ,
I have the honour to refer to the negotiations recently undertaken between our respective delegations for the purpose of drawing up provisions concerning import into the European Economic Community of mutton , lamb and goatmeat from Uruguay in connection with the implementation by the Community of the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat .
During these negotiations both parties agreed as follows : 1 .
This arrangement shall relate to : - fresh or chilled mutton , lamb and goatmeat ( subheading 02.01 A IV a ) ) of the Common Customs Tariff ) ,
- frozen mutton , lamb and goatmeat ( subheading 02.01 A IV b ) ) of the Common Customs Tariff ) .
2 .
Within the terms of this arrangement , the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Uruguay to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity :
5 100 tonnes expressed in carcass weight ( 1 ) .
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the arrangement , Uruguay undertakes to implement the appropriate procedures to ensure that the annual quantity actually exported does not exceed the quantity agreed and shall be exported in accordance with the traditional patterns of presentation ( frozen or chilled ) .
Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade , the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution .
3 .
Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause , it undertakes that Uruguay &apos;s access to the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected .
4 .
If imports from Uruguay in any one year exceed the quantities agreed , the Community reserves the right to suspend imports from Uruguay for the remainder of that year .
The quantity overshipped shall be offset against Uruguay &apos;s export entitlement for the following year .
The Community undertakes to limit the levy applicable to imports of products covered by the present arrangement to a maximum amount of 10 % , ad valorem . ( 1 ) Carcass weight ( bone-in equivalent weight ) .
By this term is understood the weight of bone-in meat presented as such as well as boned meat converted by a coefficient into bone-in weight . For this purpose 55 kg of boned mutton corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in mutton and 60 kg of boned lamb corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in lamb .
6 .
At the time of accession of new Member States , the Community , in consultation with Uruguay , will alter the quantities set out in clause 2 , in accordance with Uruguay &apos;s trade with each new Member State .
The charges applicable to imports for the said new Member State shall be fixed in accordance with the rules in the Treaty of Accession ; the maximum level of the levy specified in clause 5 of this arrangement being taken into account .
The total quantity as mentioned in clause 2 above is fixed at 5 800 tonnes in carcass weight as from the date of accession of Greece to the Community .
7 .
The Community will endeavour to avoid any market development which could prejudice the marketing of Uruguay &apos;s mutton and lamb on the Community market within the limits of the quantities agreed .
In particular , the Community will take steps to ensure that the disposal of intervention stocks in frozen form arising from the operation of the regulation does not undermine such marketing of Uruguay &apos;s mutton and lamb .
8 .
In taking account of the objectives and provisions of this arrangement the Community agrees that any actual implementation of refunds of any other form of assistance with respect to exports of mutton , lamb and live sheep and lambs intended for slaughter will apply only at prices and on conditions which comply with existing international obligations and in respect of the traditional shares of the Community of world export trade in these products .
These words shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade and in particular in conformity with Article 10 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade .
9 .
Uruguay shall ensure that this arrangement is observed , in particular , by issuing export certificates covering the products referred to in clause 1 within the limits of the quantities covered by this arrangement .
For its part , the Community shall undertake to adopt all necessary provisions to make the issue of the import certificates for the products referred to above , originating in Uruguay , subject to the presentation of an export certificate , issued by the competent authority designated by the Uruguay Government .
Detailed rules for applying this system shall be laid down in such a way as to render unnecessary the lodging of a security for the issue of the import certificate in respect of the products in question .
Also , such detailed rules of application shall provide that the competent Uruguay authority shall communicate periodically to the competent authority of the Community the quantities in respect of which export certificates are issued , broken down , where appropriate , according to destination .
10 .
A Consultative Committee shall be set up composed of representatives from the Community and from Uruguay .
The Committee shall ensure that the arrangement is being properly applied and is functioning smoothly .
It will examine regularly the trend of the two parties &apos; markets in mutton and lamb and goatmeat and the trend of the international market , as well as marketing conditions on those markets including those relevant to the objective set out in clause 7 of this arrangement .
It will ensure that the proper application of the arrangement is not affected by the export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat-based products to the Community under customs headings not referred to by the arrangement .
The Committee will discuss all questions which could arise in applying the arrangement and will recommend appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
11 .
The provisions of this arrangement shall be agreed without prejudice to the parties &apos; rights and obligations under GATT .
12 .
The annual quantity fixed in clause 2 refers to the period running from 1 January to 31 December .
The quantity applicable as of the implementation of the present arrangement and until 1 January of the following year will be fixed on a pro rata basis in relation to the total annual quantity and will take into account the seasonality of the trade .
13 .
This arrangement shall apply , on the one hand , to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and , on the other hand , to the territory of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay .

PROTOCOL TO THE EUROPEAN AGREEMENT on the Exchange of Blood-grouping Reagents
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1 . Specificity
A blood-grouping ( 1 ) reagent must react with all blood samples tested which contain the antigen homologous to the antibody or other substance mentioned on the label .
When a reagent is used according to the technique recommended by the producer there must be no evidence of any of the following factors or phenomena : ( a ) haemolytic properties ;
( b ) antibodies or other substances besides those mentioned on the label ;
( c ) bacterial products liable to cause false positive or false negative reactions ;
( d ) pseudo-agglutination through the formation of rouleaux ;
( e ) prozone phenomena .
2 . Potency
Titre is measured by making successive two-fold dilutions of the reagent under study in an appropriate medium .
To each dilution is added an equal volume of a suspension of red corpuscles .
The titre is the reciprocal of the figure representing the highest serum dilution in which a reaction occurs , the dilution being calculated without the inclusion of the volume of the corpuscular suspension in the total volume .
In the case of anti-A , anti-B and other reagents intended for use on slides , avidity is expressed by means of the time required for agglutination on a slide .
3 . International Standards and International Units
International Standards have been established by the World Health Organization for anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D blood-grouping reagents and are in process of being established for blood-grouping reagents of other specificities .
An International Standard Preparation contains , by definition , a certain number of International Units per mg or ml and this definition is independent of the titres observed against particular red corpuscle preparations ( 2 ) .
( 1 ) At the time of approving the present version of the Protocol and its Annexes , it was understood by the representatives of the Contracting Parties that when in the English text of the Agreement the expression &quot; blood incompatibilities &quot; was mentioned , &quot; blood grouping incompatibilities &quot; was implied .
It was also agreed that the expression &quot; blood-grouping &quot; with a hyphen in the English text on the Agreement and of the Protocol should read as &quot; blood grouping &quot; without a hyphen .
The potency of blood-grouping reagents for which International Standard Preparations exist ( at present anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D ) can be expressed in International Units ( see Bull , Wld . Hlth . Org . 1954 , 10 , 937 , 941-1950 , 3 , 301 ) on the basis of the titration of the unknown reagent in comparison with the International Standard , or a national sub-standard .
The International Standard Preparations of blood-grouping sera are dispensed in ampoules containing dried human serum .
When reconstituted to the volume of 1 ml , the anti-A and anti-B sera contain by definition 256 International Units per ml .
They can be obtained free of charge , from the International Laboratory for Biological Standards of WHO , Statens Seruminstitut , Copenhagen .
The following table shows an example of a comparative titration of the International Standard anti-A Serum ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti-A reagent ( U ) against A1 red corpuscles and A2B red corpuscles . &gt; PIC FILE = &quot; T0045086 &quot; &gt;
4 . Stability and expiry date
Each reagent , when kept under the conditions of storage recommended by the manufacturer , should retain the requisite properties for at least one year .
The expiry date of a reagent in the liquid form as given on the label shall be not more than one year from the date of the last satisfactory potency test .
The expiry date can be extended for further periods of one year by repetition of potency tests .
The expiry date of reagents in the dried form as given on the label shall be in accordance with evidence obtained from experiments on stability and shall be approved by the national control authorities .
5 . Preservation
Blood-grouping reagents may be preserved in the liquid or dried state .
Dried reagents shall be kept in an atmosphere of an inert gas or in vacuo , in the glass container in which they were dried and which shall be closed so as to exclude moisture .
A dried reagent must not lose more than 0,5 % of its weight when tested by further drying over phosphorus pentoxide at a pressure not exceeding 0,02 mm of mercury for 24 hours .
Reagents shall be prepared with aseptic precautions and shall be free from bacterial contamination .
In order to prevent bacterial growth the competent national authority may decide that an antiseptic and / or antibiotic shall be added to the reagent ( or to any solvent issued with dried reagents ) , provided that , in the presence of the added substance , the reagent still fulfils the requirements for specificity and potency .
Blood-grouping sera of human origin must contain at least 2,5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or reconstituted serum .
Reagents whether in the liquid state or after reconstitution should be transparent and should not contain any sediment , gel or visible particles .
6 . Coloration
Blood-grouping reagents for international exchanges should preferably not be artificially coloured at least until an international agreement is reached on a uniform system .
Any added colouring matter must not interfere with the specific reaction .
7 . Dispensing and volume
Blood-grouping reagents shall be dispensed in such a way and in such volumes that the reagent in one container is sufficient for the performance of tests with positive and negative control corpuscles in addition to the performance of tests with the unknown corpuscles .
The volume in one container shall be such that the contents can if necessary be used for the performance of the appropriate tests for potency described in this Protocol .
8 . Records and samples
Written records shall be kept by the producing laboratory of all steps in the production and control of blood-grouping reagents .
Adequate samples of all reagents issued shall be retained by the laboratory until it can be reasonably assumed that the batch is no longer in use .
9 . Classification of reagents
Reagents used for blood-grouping may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin , of which some constitute the active principle and others are adjuvants for enhancing the activity or maintaining the stability of the reagent .
For technical reasons these reagents have been divided into three categories according to the origin of their active principle .
This does not mean that reagents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reagents cannot contain substances of human origin .
10 . Labels , leaflets and certificates
A label printed in English and French , in black on white paper , shall be affixed to each final container and shall contain the following information : 1 . Name and address of producer ;
2 . Name of the reagent as it appears in the heading of the relevant specification ;

When anti-A + anti-B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1 , agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or a reference preparation of equivalent avidity .
When anti-A + anti-B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ax ( Ay or Ao ) cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1 , agglutination shall first appear in not more than five minutes at a temperature between 18 and 25 ° C.
( b ) SERA OF HUMAN ORIGIN FOR Rh GROUPING
Anti-Rh blood-grouping sera , whatever their specificity , may be of either of two varieties differing in the conditions under which agglutination of homologous corpuscles is obtained .
Certain sera commonly known as &quot; complete &quot; agglutinate corpuscles suspended in saline .
With others , commonly known as &quot; incomplete &quot; , agglutination can only be obtained in the presence of certain colloids such as bovine albumin or by means of other special techniques .
The sera should be used under the conditions specified by the laboratory preparing them .
Some &quot; incomplete &quot; sera will also agglutinate homologous red corpuscles suspended in their own serum or plasma on slides .
The following requirements of potency for Rh grouping sera may need to be revised when International Standard Preparations become available . ( i ) Anti-D ( anti-Rho ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-D serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the D antigen of the Rh system .
It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the D antigen , but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the D antigen .
Potency
Titration
&quot; Complete &quot; anti-D sera shall have a titre of not less than 32 against CcDee cells in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre .
An &quot; incomplete &quot; anti-D serum shall be titrated against CcDee corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of Incomplete Anti-D ( anti-Rho ) or an equivalent reference preparation .
It shall have a potency of not less than 32 International Units .
Besides reacting with all red corpuscles containing the D antigen , the serum should , as far as possible , react with corpuscles containing the Du antigen .
Determination of avidity
Anti-D sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a 40 to 50 % suspension of CcDee corpuscles at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( ii ) Anti-C ( anti Rh &apos; ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-C serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the C agglutinogen of the Rh system .
It agglutinates suspensions of human red corpuscles containing the C antigen , but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the C antigen .
In this connection the C antigen is regarded as including the Cw antigen .
Most diagnostic anti-C sera contain &quot; complete &quot; anti-C together with &quot; incomplete &quot; anti-D .
These sera are therefore specific for the C antigen only when the cells under test are suspended in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre .
Potency
Titration
Anti-C sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a titre of not less than 8 against Ccddee corpuscles .
Determination of avidity
Anti-C sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson ( and which must not contain any form of anti-D ) should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ccddee cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5 , at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( iii ) Anti-E ( anti-rh &quot; ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-E serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the E antigen of the Rh system .
It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the E antigen .
Potency
Titration
Anti-E sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a titre of not less than 8 against ccddEe corpuscles .
Determination of avidity
Anti-E sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson ( and which must contain any form of anti-D ) should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of ccddEe cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5 , at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( iv ) Anti-D + C ( anti-Rhorh &apos; ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-D + E ( anti-Rhorh &quot; ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Sera of specificity anti-D + C and of specificity anti-D + E may be obtained directly from the blood of immunized individuals or may be prepared by mixing anti-D with anti-C or anti-E serum .
In a given serum both antibodies must be simultaneously active under the conditions of reaction specified by the producer .
Each serum must react with all types of red corpuscles which would react with either of the component antibodies , and must fail to react with red corpuscles which contain neither the C nor D antigen in the case of anti-D + C and neither D nor E antigen in the case of anti-D + E. The titres should not be less than those specified for the component antibodies , but in the case of anti-D + C ( which is a frequent combination in the serum of immunized persons ) it is desirable that the anti-C titre should be not less than 32 and in the case of anti-D + E it is desirable that the anti-E titre should be not less than 8 .
Where a serum is intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson , the times of agglutination for all reacting types of red corpuscles should be not less than those specified for the component antibodies .

CONSIDERING that , in the framework of action to strengthen the internal market , the Community has decided to introduce a single administrative document for use in such trade from 1 January 1988 ;
CONSIDERING it appropriate to simplify also formalities in trade in goods between the Community and the EFTA countries as well as between the EFTA countries themselves , in particular by introducing a single administrative document ;
CONSIDERING that no provision of this Convention may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from their obligations under other international agreements ,
HAVE DECIDED TO CONCLUDE THE FOLLOWING CONVENTION :
General provisions
Article 1
This Convention lays down measures to simplify formalities in trade in goods between the Community and the EFTA countries , as well as between the EFTA countries themselves , in particular by introducing a single administrative document ( hereinafter referred to as the single document ) to be used for any procedure at export and import and for a common transit procedure applicable to trade between the Contracting Parties ( hereinafter referred to as transit ) , regardless of the kind and origin of the goods .
Article 2
Where goods are the subject of trade between the Contracting Parties , the formalities connected with such trade shall be completed using a single document based on a declaration form , the specimens of which are to be found in Annex I to this Convention .
The single document shall , depending on the circumstances , serve as a declaration or document of export , transit or import .
Article 3
Administrative documents may be required by a Contracting Party in addition to the single document only where :
- expressly required for the implementation of a legislation in force in a Contracting Party for which the use of the single document would not suffice ;
- required under the terms of international agreements to which it is a party ;
- required from operators to enable them to qualify , at their request , for an advantage or a specific facility .
Article 4
1 . Nothing in this Convention shall preclude the Contracting Parties from applying simplified procedures , whether or not based on the use of computers , with a view to greater simplification for operators .
2 . Simplified procedures may , in particular , consist in allowing operators not to have to present to a customs office either the goods in question or the declaration relating to them , or in allowing them to draw up an incomplete declaration .
In such cases , a declaration , which , if the competent authorities agree , may be a general periodic declaration , must be submitted subsequently within the time-limits laid down by those authorities .
In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 , operators may be authorized to use commercial documents in the place of the single document .
Where the single document is used , the persons concerned may , on authorization by the competent authorities , attach to it commercial schedules describing the goods in lieu of continuation sheets of the single document for the purpose of completing formalities for any procedure at export and import .
3 . Nothing in this Convention shall preclude the Contracting Parties from :
- dispensing with the single document with regard to postal traffic ( by letter or parcel post ) ;
- dispensing with the requirement of written declarations ;
- concluding between themselves agreements or arrangements with a view to greater simplification of formalities in all or part of the trade between them ;
- allowing the use of loading lists for the completion of transit formalities in the case of consignments composed of several kinds of goods , in lieu of continuation sheets of the single document ;
- allowing declarations to be made , where appropriate on plain paper , by means of public or private computers on conditions fixed by the competent authorities ;
- enabling the competent authorities to require that data necessary for completing the formalities in question be entered in their computerized declaration-processing systems without , where appropriate , requiring a written declaration ;
- enabling the competent authorities , should a computerized declaration-processing system be used , to provide that the export , transit or import declaration be constituted either by the single document produced by that system or by entry of the data in the computer if such a document is not produced ;
- applying any facility adopted by way of a decision of the Joint Committee , as referred to in Article 11 ( 3 ) .
Formalities
Article 5
1 . Provisions on the completion , by means of the single document , of the formalities needed for the export , transit and import of the goods are laid down in Annex II to this Convention .
2 . The common codes to be used in the forms laid down in Annex I are to be found in Annex III to this Convention .
Article 6
1 . The declaration must be completed in one of the official languages of the Contracting Parties which is acceptable to the competent authorities of the country in which the export or transit formalities are completed .
Where necessary , the customs authority of the country of destination or of transit may require from the declarant or his representative in that country a translation of the said declaration into the official language or one of the official languages of that country .
2 . By way of derogation from paragraph 1 , the declaration shall be completed in one of the official languages of the country of import in all cases where the declaration in that country is made on copies of the declaration from other than those presented to the customs authorities of the country of export or departure .
Article 7
1 . The declarant or his representative may , for each stage of an operation involving trade in goods between Contracting Parties , use the copies of the declaration necessary for completion of the formalities relating to that stage alone , to which may be attached , where appropriate , the copies necessary for completion of the formalities relating to one or other of the subsequent stages of that operation .
2 . The benefit of the provisions of paragraph 1 shall not be subject to compliance with any special condition imposed by the competent authorities .
However , without prejudice to specific provisions concerning groupage traffic , the competent authorities may lay down that formalities relating to export and transit operations should be completed on the same form by means of copies corresponding to these formalities .
Article 8
In the cases referred to in Article 7 , the competent authorities shall , to the extent possible , satisfy themselves that the particulars given in the copies of the declaration drawn up in the course of the various stages of the operation in question all agree .
Administrative assistance
Article 9
1 . In order to ensure the smooth functioning of trade between the Contracting Parties and to facilitate the detection of any irregularity or infringement , the customs authorities of the countries concerned shall , upon request or , where they consider that this would be in the interest of another Contracting Party , on their own initiative , provide
each other with all available information ( including administrative reports and findings ) of interest for the proper implementation of this Convention .
2 . Assistance may be withheld or denied , totally or partly , when the requested country considers that the assistance would be prejudicial to its security , public policy ( ordre public ) or other essential interests , or would violate an industrial , commercial or professional secret .
3 . If assistance is withheld or denied , the decision and the reasons therefor must be notified to the requesting country without delay .
4 . If the customs authority of a country requests assistance which it would not be able to give if requested , it shall draw attention to that fact in the request .
Compliance with such a request shall be at the discretion of the customs authority to whom the request is made .
5 . Information obtained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be used solely for the purposes of this Convention and shall be accorded the same protection by a receiving country as is afforded to information of like nature under the national law of that country .
Such information may be used for other purposes only with the written consent of the customs authority which furnished them and subject to any restrictions laid down by that authority .

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON OLIVE OIL AND TABLE OLIVES , 1986
PREAMBLE
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT ,
BEARING IN MIND that the olive tree :
- is not only a plant indispensable for the maintenance and conservation of soils , but one which makes it possible to develop land that will not bear other crops and which , even under non-intensive farming conditions , which account for the bulk of present production , responds favourably to any improvement in cultivation ,
- is a perennial fruit tree that , with appropriate techniques , permits a return on what is invested in its cultivation ,
EMPHASIZING that its cultivation governs the existence and standard of living of millions of families which are wholly dependent on the measures taken to maintain and expand the consumption of its products , both in the producing countries themselves and in non-producing consumer countries ,
MINDFUL that olive oil and table olives are essential basic commodities in the regions where olive-growing is established ,
BEARING IN MIND that the essential feature of olive production lies in irregular harvests and in the irregularity with which supplies reach the market , and that this results in fluctuations in the value of production , instability of prices and export earnings , and considerable differences in producers incomes ,
BEARING IN MIND that these circumstances give rise to special difficulties which may seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and jeopardize general policies of economic expansion in countries in the regiones where olive-growing is established ,
EMPHASIZING in this connection the major importance of olive production to the economies of many countries , particularly developing olive-growing countries ,
MINDFUL that the measures to be taken in the light of the very particular characteristics of olive-growing and of the market for its products transcend the national sphere , and that international action is essential ,
CONSIDERING the International Olive Oil Agreement , 1956 , as amended by the Protocol of 3 April 1958 , as well as the International Olive Oil Agreement , 1963 , as extended and amended on several occasions , and the International Olive Oil Agreement , 1979 ,
CONSIDERING that the 1979 Agreement will expire on 31 December 1986 ,
BEING OF THE VIEW that it is essential to continue and develop the work undertaken within the framework of the said Agreements and that it is desirable to conclude a new Agreement ,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS :
