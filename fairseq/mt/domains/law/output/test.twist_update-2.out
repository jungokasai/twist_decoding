Mr Ambassador .
Given that the Council Recommendation of the Customs Cooperation Council of 18 June 1976 amending the tariff scheme applicable for the classification of goods in customs tariffs and certain autonomous amendments to the Common Customs Tariff and the Swiss Customs Tariff will apply from 1 January 1978 onwards , it is appropriate to amend certain tariff names in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation signed on 22 July 1972 .
In addition , in order to simplify in the future , in order to simplify the procedure for adjusting tariff specifications in the event of further amendments to one of the Parties &apos; tariffs , the inclusion of an Article 12 bis is also appropriate .
The aforementioned amendments are listed in the Annex .
I have the honour to confirm that the Community is in agreement with these amendments and to inform you of the date of entry into force of 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the agreement of your Government to the above .
Please accept , Ambassador , the expression of my highest esteem .

Mr ... !
I have the honour to confirm receipt of your letter of today &apos;s with the following wording :
&quot; Whereas the recommendation of the Customs Cooperation Council of 18 June 1976 to amend the scheme of customs tariffs for the classification of goods in customs tariffs and certain autonomous amendments to the Common Customs Tariff and the Swiss Customs Tariff apply from 1 January 1978 on , it is therefore appropriate to amend the scheme of certain tariff names in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation signed on 22 July 1972 .
In addition , in order to simplify in the future , in order to simplify the procedure for adjusting tariff specifications in the event of further amendments to one of the Parties &apos; tariffs , the inclusion of an Article 12 bis is also appropriate .
The aforementioned amendments are listed in the Annex .
I have the honour to confirm that the Community is in agreement with these amendments and to inform you of the date of entry into force of 1 January 1978 .

AGREEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Settlements concerning the mobilisation of claims by Member States under medium @-@ term financial assistance
A. Letter from the Bank for International Settlements
Mr President .
The BIZ could conclude standby credit agreements with creditor central banks if the banks make a request to do so .
The agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the creditor to the mechanism , up to a total limit of 2,725 billion units of account , representing 50 % of all future deployment ceiling funds in the Member States .
The details of the standby agreements would have to be regulated between the BIS and the central bank in question .
However , some conditions that the MIS would be willing to apply are already listed below .
For each standby loan , the BIS would initially undertake an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions without , however , exceeding a total of five years .
When the loans were opened and , if so , when extended , the BIS would calculate a credit opening fee .
Furthermore , it would be agreed that the first drawings will not be made before the end of one month after the conclusion of the Standby Agreement , in order to enable the Bank to make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
drawings would be in currencies available to the BIS at the time of conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would cover periods that would have to be negotiated taking into account the Bank &apos;s resources , probably three or six months .
The terms and conditions would be similar to those applied by BIS to transactions carried out under similar conditions at the time , i.e. interest rates would largely be in line with market rates .
Normally , interest rates are likely to be slightly higher than Libor .
However , if BIS had to procure the necessary resources itself on the market , the interest rate applicable could reach a maximum corresponding to the Libor increased by an appropriate margin .
I should be grateful if you would inform me of the agreement of the Council of the European Communities to this effect .
Please accept , Mr President , the expression of my deepest respect .
For the Bank for International Settlements
