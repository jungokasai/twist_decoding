To this end , the EEC Organisation has presented a table indicating how it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this Agreement ,
HAVE AGREED THE PARTIES FOLLOWING :
ARTICLE I
Setting up and managing the Special Action Account

The Organisation shall set up a special account called a &quot; Special Action Account &quot; consisting of the funds which the Member States contribute to the Special Action Account pursuant to this Convention , which shall be held and used in trust by the Organisation as Administrator ( in this capacity the Organisation shall be referred to as the &quot; Administrator &quot; ) for the sole purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
The Special Action Account is held separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .

Each Member State shall , as a contribution to the Special Action Account , pay in its national currency an amount corresponding to the amount in US dollars indicated below for that Member State at the time of signature of this Agreement . Member States * Amount ( in millions of US dollars ) * Belgium * 15.90 * Denmark * 11.28 * Federal Republic of Germany * 119.08 * France * 56.48 * Ireland * 1.04 * Italy * 34.92 * Luxembourg * 0.50 * Netherlands * 30.80 * United Kingdom * 115.00 * 385.00 . *

Contributions shall be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest @-@ bearing notes of the Member State , payable on request in the currency of the State concerned to the Organisation acting as manager of the Special Action Account and deposited with the depositary institution of the Organisation in the country concerned .
( b ) Payment shall be made in two instalments , i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 % of the contribution within 30 days of the entry into force of this Agreement or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the administrator ;
( ii ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines for parliamentary approval of the annual budgets .
( c ) Any Member State may , if desired , make payments before the above dates .

The administrator , in accordance with the usual procedures of the Organization , makes approximately proportional drawings on the cash or promissory notes in order to cover the expenditure on the Special Action Loans and adequately compensate the Special Action Account .
ARTICLE II
Use of the Special Promotional Account

All amounts credited to the Special Action Account will be used exclusively by the administrator , in accordance with the provisions of the EEC , to grant Special Action Loans to member countries of the Organisation with low income and intangible needs , in particular the least developed ( 1 ) and most disadvantaged ( 1 ) developing countries whose development prospects have been substantially reduced by external factors that are facing general resource transfer problems and may have debt service difficulties as a result .
In granting these loans , in accordance with the conditions of the EEC , the administrator shall be guided by the following factors :
( i ) the relative poverty of the developing country concerned and its long @-@ term growth potential ;
( iii ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and foreseeable economic problems ;
( iv ) the development and future prospects of the country &apos;s export earnings ;
( v ) the country &apos;s capacity to ensure imports of goods essential to the development process ;
( vi ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further borrowing capacity to borrow on unfavourable terms ; and
( vii ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be resolved by contributions from other sources .

Each Special Action Loan is intended to finance a clearly defined and rapidly disbursable development programme or project ( including a sectoral project ) assessed , approved and managed , whether or not part of the Organisation &apos;s lending programme , in accordance with the procedures and practices applicable to development credits financed from the Organisation &apos;s ordinary resources , taking into account the objective of additionality referred to in point ( b ) of the preamble to this Agreement .
The funds of the Special Action Account may not be used in place of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which are bound by a loan or credit for a programme or project already approved by the Directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the date of entry into force of this Agreement .

With the exception of Section 4 , Special Action Loans are subject to the same repayment terms as those applicable to development loans generally granted by the Organisation and are therefore repayable in 50 years for ten free years .
Special action loans are not subject to interest .

Special action loans are granted in one or more Member States &apos; currencies and are repayable in those currencies .
Section 5
The administrator shall be entitled , in accordance with the usual procedures of the Organisation , to charge each beneficiary of a Special Action Loan , for the remuneration of the services provided by it under this Agreement , an annual administration fee of three quarters of one per cent ( 3 / 4 of one per cent ) of the amount of the loan capital not yet repaid at that time , in a currency acceptable to the Organisation .
Amounts for the payment of this fee are to be paid directly to the organisation which withholds them .

Each Special Action Loan must be identified by a separate loan agreement between the beneficiary country and the administrator , specifying in particular the origin of the funds .

The proceeds from each Special Action Loan may be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the Organisation and which may be the recipients of a Special Action Loan in accordance with what the administrator has determined at the time of granting the loan .

Capital repayments of Special Action Loans shall be made into the Special Action Account and the amount thereby repaid in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred back to the Member State concerned by the administrator as soon as possible after receipt of the Special Action Loans .
The organization is not liable for defaults in the repayment of special action loans .
ARTICLE III
Reports ; consultations

The administrator shall inform the EEC of the projects and programmes being prepared for examination by the Directors and approved by the Directors until all the Special Action Loans have been granted in full .
During the disbursement of the Special Action Loans , the administrator shall inform the EEC on a quarterly basis of the development of the Special Action Loans and the expenditure incurred for this purpose .
The administrator shall send to the EEC , as soon as possible after the end of the financial year , a detailed account of the Special Action Account with an opinion of the Organisation &apos;s external auditors on this account .
After full disbursement of the Special Action Loans , the administrator of the EEC shall submit as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the Special Action Account .

The administrator shall draw up and maintain appropriate records and accounts showing the contributions to the Special Action Account , the obligations to be financed from the funds in the account , the amounts received and paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States .

The EEC and the administrators shall cooperate closely to achieve the objectives of this Agreement .
To this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrators shall from time to time hold an exchange of views on the status of the Special Action Account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by Special Action Accounts and any other issues relating to the provisions of this Agreement , pending the full disbursement of the funds of the Special Action Account .
ARTICLE IV
Termination ; Distribution

If this Agreement does not enter into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , as may be agreed by the EEC and the Organisation , the Agreement and all obligations of the parties arising therefrom shall lapse with immediate effect .

Once the total principal amount of all Special Action Loans drawn on by the beneficiaries has been repaid and transferred back to the Member States in accordance with Article II ( 8 ) of this Agreement , this Agreement and all obligations of the parties arising therefrom shall be terminated with immediate effect .
ARTICLE V
Final Provisions

This Agreement shall be subject to approval by each Member State and the EEC in accordance with the procedural provisions of each Party .

The Governments of the Member States shall notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities of the completion of the procedures concerning them .

Brussels , the ...
Mr Ambassador .
Given that the Council Recommendation on Customs Cooperation of 18 June 1976 amending the tariff scheme for the classification of goods in customs tariffs and certain autonomous amendments to the Common Customs Tariff and the Swiss Customs Tariff apply as from 1 January 1978 , it is appropriate to amend the scheme of certain tariff names in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation signed on 22 July 1972 .
Furthermore , in order to simplify the procedure for the adjustment of tariff denominations in the event of new changes to the tariff of one of the Contracting Parties in the future , it seems appropriate to include an Article 12 bis in the Agreement .
The aforementioned changes are listed in the Annex .
I have the honour of confirming the Community &apos;s agreement to these amendments and I propose that the date of entry into force be 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm to me that your government agrees with the above .
Permit me , Mr Ambassador , to express my highest esteem .

On behalf of the Government of the Swiss Federation
AGREEMENT in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Settlements on the mobilisation of Member States &apos; claims under medium @-@ term financial assistance
A. Letter from the Bank for International Settlements
Mr President .
The BIS could enter into standby credit agreements with the central banks of creditor countries if the banks so request .
The agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the creditor country to the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.725 billion units of account , representing 50 % of all future deployment funds of the member states .
The details of the standby agreements would have to be settled between the BIS and the relevant central bank .
However , a number of conditions that the MIS would be willing to apply are already listed below .
For each standby loan , the BIS would initially undertake a two @-@ year commitment , with the possibility of extending it , but not exceeding five years in total .
The BIS would charge a credit opening commission on the opening of the loans and on any renewal thereof .
Furthermore , it would be agreed that the first drawings would not be made before the end of one month after the standby agreement in order to allow the Bank to make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
The drawings would be made in the currencies available to the BIS upon conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would cover periods to be negotiated taking into account the Bank &apos;s resources , probably three or six months .
The terms would be similar to those applied by the BIS to transactions under similar conditions at any given time , i.e. interest rates would be broadly in line with market rates .
Normally , interest rates would be marginally higher than Libor .
However , if the BIS has to raise the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate applied could reach a maximum equivalent to the Libor increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you could inform me of the agreement of the Council of the European Communities .
Permit me , Mr President , to express my highest esteem .
For the Bank for International Settlements
B. Letter from the Community
Director @-@ General .
I have the honour of confirming the receipt of your letter today with the following wording :
&quot; The BIS could conclude standby credit agreements with the central banks of creditor countries if the banks so request .
The agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the creditor country to the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.725 billion units of account , representing 50 % of all future deployment funds of the member states .
The details of the standby agreements would have to be settled between the BIS and the relevant central bank .
However , a number of conditions that the MIS would be willing to apply are already listed below .
For each standby loan , the BIS would initially undertake a two @-@ year commitment , with the possibility of extending it , but not exceeding five years in total .
The BIS would charge a credit opening commission on the opening of the loans and on any renewal thereof .
Furthermore , it would be agreed that the first drawings would not be made before the end of one month after the standby agreement in order to allow the Bank to make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
The drawings would be made in the currencies available to the BIS upon conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would cover periods to be negotiated taking into account the Bank &apos;s resources , probably three or six months .
The terms would be similar to those applied by the BIS to transactions under similar conditions at any given time , i.e. interest rates would be broadly in line with market rates .
Normally , interest rates would be marginally higher than Libor .
However , if the BIS has to raise the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate applied could reach a maximum equivalent to the Libor increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you could inform me of the agreement of the Council of the European Communities . &quot;
I am pleased to inform you of the agreement of the Council of the European Communities on the content of this letter .
Permit me , Mr Director @-@ General , to express my highest esteem .
For the Council of the European Communities :
