OBJECTIVES OF THE MEASURES IN QUESTION
Article 28
The purpose of safeguards procedures laid down in this Convention is to detect the timely discovery of diversion of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices for unknown purposes and to dissuasive such diversion from the risk of early detection .
Article 29
In order to achieve the objective set out in Article 28 , material accountancy shall be used as a safeguard measure of fundamental importance , containment and surveillance as a major complementary measure .
Article 30
The technical completion by the Agency of the audits shall be carried out by means of a declaration specifying , for each material balance area , the quantity of material not proven for a given period , including the accuracy limits of the measurements specified .
COMMUNITY SUBSIDY SYSTEM
Article 31
In carrying out its inspections , the organisation referred to in Article 3 shall make full use of the Community guarantee system .
Article 32
The accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear materials established by this Convention shall be based on a classification in material balance areas .
In applying safeguards measures , the Community shall use the following procedures and measures and , if necessary , make provision for them to be specified and relevant in the supplementary Arrangements :
( a ) a system of measurement to determine the quantities of nuclear material derived , produced , dispatched , lost , or otherwise removed from the herd and the quantities of stocks ;
( b ) the evaluation of the feasibility and accuracy of the measurements and the assessment of the measurement uncertainty ;
( c ) procedures for identifying , verifying and evaluating differences in measurements made by consignors and consignees ;
( d ) procedures for taking physical inventories ;

AGREEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Settlements concerning the mobilisation of claims held by Member States in the framework of the medium-term financial assistance
A. Letter from the Bank for International Settlements
Sir ,
BZ could conclude stand-alone credit agreements with the central banks of creditors if the banks so request .
The agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the creditor to the mechanism , up to a total limit of 2,725 billion units of account , representing 50 % of all future stand-by ceiling in the Member States .
The details of the standardisation agreements should be regulated between the BIZ and the relevant central bank .
However , the conditions currently stated below are certain conditions which would be acceptable to the use of BIZ .
For each stand-by loan , BIZ would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions without , however , exceeding a total of five years .
When opening the credits and extending them , BIZ would calculate a credit commission .
Moreover , it would be agreed that the first drawings will not be made before the end of one month after the conclusion of the Standing Agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
drawings were made in currencies available in the BIZ at the conclusion of the agreement and would be very likely to take place in USD ; they would cover periods to be negotiated taking into account the bank ’ s funds , which would be expected to be three months or six months .
The terms and conditions would be similar to those applied by BZ to transactions carried out under similar conditions at the time , i.e. interest rates would largely be in line with market rates .
Normally , interest rates are likely to be slightly higher than &quot; Liboron &quot; rates only .
However , if BZ had to procure the necessary resources itself on the market , the rate applicable could not exceed the rate corresponding to the colour of a suitable margin .
I should be obliged if you would inform you of the agreement of the Council of the European Communities to this effect .
Please accept , Sir , the assurance of my highest consideration .
