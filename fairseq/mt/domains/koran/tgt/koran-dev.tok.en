I shall fill the hearts of infidels with terror .
So smite them on their necks and every joint , ( and incapacitate them ) , &quot;
For they had opposed God and His Apostle ; but whosoever opposes God and his Apostle ( should know ) that God is severe in retribution .
For you is this ( punishment ) to taste , for the infidels the torment of Hell .
O believers , when you meet unbelievers on the field of battle , do not turn your backs to them .
For any one who turns his back on that day , except to manoeuvre or rally to his side , will bring the wrath of God on himself , and have Hell as abode ; and what an evil destination !
It was not you who killed them , but God did so .
You did not throw what you threw , ( sand into the eyes of the enemy at Badr ) , but God , to bring out the best in the faithful by doing them a favour of His own .
God is all-hearing and all-knowing .
That was that , but remember God will make the plots of the unbelievers contemptible .
You had asked for a judgement , so the judgement has come to you ( In the form of victory for the faithful ) .
So , if you desist it will be better for you . If you come back to it , We shall do the same , and your forces , however large , will not be of the least avail , for God is with those who believe .
O believers , obey God and His Messenger , and do not turn away from him when you hear ( him speak ) ;
And do not be like those who say : &quot; We have heard , &quot; but do not hear .
The worst of creatures in the eyes of God are those who are deaf and dumb and devoid of sense .
If God had seen any good in them He would surely have made them hear .
Now even if He makes them hear they will turn away ( in obduracy ) .
O believers , respond to the call of God and His Prophet when he calls you to what will give you life ( and preservation ) . Remember that God intervenes between man and his heart , and that you will be gathered before Him .
Beware of sedition , which does not affect the oppressors alone among you , and know that the punishment of God is severe .
Remember , when you were few and powerless in the land , afraid of despoliation at the hands of men . But then God sheltered and helped you to strength , and provided for you good things that you may perhaps be grateful .
O you who believe , do not be faithless to God and His Apostle , nor violate your trusts knowingly .
Know that your worldly possessions and your children are just a temptation , and that God has greater rewards with Him .
O believers , if you follow the path shown by God , He will give you a standard ( of right and wrong ) , and overlook your sins , and forgive you . God is abounding in benevolence .
Remember , when the infidels contrived to make you a prisoner or to murder or expel you , they plotted , but God also planned ; and God &apos;s plan is the best .
When Our messages were read out to them , they said : &quot; We have heard .
We could certainly compose ( writings ) like them if we choose . They are but only tales of long ago . &quot;
They had also said : &quot; If this be the truth from you , O God , then rain down on us stones from the skies , or inflict a grievous punishment upon us . &quot;
But God would not choose to punish them while you are in their midst , nor afflict them when they are seeking forgiveness .
But what is there so special they have that God should not punish them when they obstruct people from the Holy Mosque , though they are not its ( appointed ) guardians ?
Its guardians could be only those who are pious and devout . But most of them do not know .
Their worship in the House of God has been no more than whistling and clapping .
So they have to taste the punishment for disbelief .
Those who disbelieve spend their possessions on turning men away from God .
They will go on spending and rue it in the end , and will be subdued .
But those who remain disbelievers shall be gathered into Hell
That God may separate the bad from the good , and link the wicked together and cast them into Hell .
These are verily the people who will lose .
You tell the unbelievers in case they desist whatever has happened will be forgiven them . If they persist , they should remember the fate of those who have gone before them .
So , fight them till all opposition ends , and obedience is wholly God &apos;s .
If they desist then verily God sees all they do .
But if they are obstinate , know that God is your helper and protector : How excellent a helper , and how excellent a protector is He !
Know that one-fifth of what you acquire as booty ( of war ) is for God and His Apostle , and for relatives and orphans , the poor and wayfarers , if you truly believe in God and what We revealed to Our votary on the day of victory over the infidels when the two armies clashed ( at Badr ) . For God has the power to do any thing .
( That day ) when you were at one end of the valley , ( the unbelievers ) at the other , and the caravan below you ( on the lowland by the coast ) , you would surely have declined to fight if ( the Makkans ) had offered you battle .
( But the battle did take place ) that God may end the matter which had been accomplished , so that he who had to die may perish after a clear demonstration , and he who had to live may survive in the light of positive proof , for God hears all and knows everything .
God showed ( the Makkans ) to be few in your dream , for if He had shown them to be many you would surely have lost courage and disagreed about the ( wisdom ) of the battle . But God spared you this , for He surely knows what is in the hearts of men .
When you faced them He made ( the enemy ) seem few to you in numbers , and made you appear fewer in their eyes , ( it was ) so that God could accomplish what had been decreed ; for all things rest with God .
O believers , when you meet an army , stand firm , and think of God a great deal that you may be blessed with success .
Obey God and His Apostle , and do not disagree among yourselves or you will be unmanned and lose courage .
Persevere , for God is with those who endure .
Do not be like those who went out of their homes full of their own importance , ostentatiously , trying to hinder others from the way of God .
But God encompasses all they do .
Satan made their deeds look alluring to them , and said : &quot; None will prevail over you this day , for I shall be near at hand . &quot;
Yet when the two armies appeared face to face , he turned back and fled , saying : &quot; I am not with you , for I can see what you cannot perceive .
I fear God , for His punishment is severe . &quot;
The hypocrites , and those who had doubts in their hearts , said : &quot; Their faith has misled them . &quot;
But whoever places his trust in God will find God mighty and wise .
If you could only see the infidels as the angels draw away their souls and strike their faces and their backs , ( saying ) : &quot; Taste the torment of burning
For what you have brought upon yourselves . &quot; God is surely not unjust to His creatures , ( they are unjust to themselves ) .
Their case is like that of Pharaoh &apos;s people , and of those before them , who denied the revelations of God , and were punished for their sins by God , and God is all powerful and Severe His punishment .
God does not withdraw a favour bestowed upon a people unless they change themselves , for God hears all and knows everything .
This was the case with the people of Pharaoh and those before them , who rejected the signs of their Lord and were destroyed for their sins , and We drowned the people of Pharaoh as they were oppressors .
Verily the worst of creatures in the sight of God are those who deny ( the truth ) , and will not believe .
As for those with whom you have made a treaty and who abrogate it every time , and do not fear God ,
If you meet them in battle , inflict on them such a defeat as would be a lesson for those who come after them , and that they may be warned .
If you apprehend treachery from a people ( with whom you have a treaty ) , retaliate by breaking off ( relations ) with them , for God does not like those who are treacherous .
The infidels should not think that they can bypass ( the law of God ) .
Surely they cannot get away .
Prepare against them whatever arms and cavalry you can muster , that you may strike terror in ( the hearts of ) the enemies of God and your own , and others besides them not known to you , but known to God . Whatever you spend in the way of God will be paid back to you in full , and no wrong will be done to you .
But if they are inclined to peace , make peace with them , and have trust in God , for He hears all and knows everything .
If they try to cheat you , God is surely sufficient for you .
It is He who has strengthened you with His help and with believers
Whose hearts He cemented with love .
You could never have united their hearts even if you had spent whatever ( wealth ) is in the earth ; but God united them with love , for He is all-mighty and all-wise .
God is sufficient for you , O Prophet , and the faithful who follow you .
O Prophet , urge the faithful to fight .
If there are twenty among you with determination they will vanquish two hundred ; and if there are a hundred then they will vanquish a thousand unbelievers , for they are people devoid of understanding .
God has lightened your burden as He knows you are weak : So , if there are a hundred men of firm determination among you , they will vanquish two hundred ; and if there are a thousand of you they will vanquish two thousand by the will of God , for God is with those who are determined .
No apostle should take captives until he has battled and subdued the country .
You desire the vanities of this world , but God wills ( for you the reward ) of the world to come ; and God is all-mighty and all-wise .
Had this not been decreed by God in advance , you would have suffered a grievous punishment for what you took ( as booty ) .
But now use such of the spoils as are lawful and good , and fear God , for God is forgiving and kind .
O Prophet , tell the captives you have taken : &quot; If God finds some good in your hearts , He will reward you with something better than was taken away from you , and forgive your sins , for God is forgiving and kind . &quot;
If they try to deceive you , remember they have deceived God before .
So He gave you mastery over them , for God is all-knowing and all-wise .
Those who accepted the faith and set out of their homes , and fought in the way of God wealth and soul , and those who gave them shelter and helped them , are friends of one another .
You are not responsible for protecting those who embraced the faith but did not leave their homes , until they do so .
In ease they ask for your help in the name of faith , you are duty bound to help them , except against a people with whom you have a treaty ; for God sees all that you do .
Those who are infidels aid one another .
Unless you do the same there will be discord in the land and anarchy .
Those who accepted the faith and abandoned their homes , and struggled in the cause of God , and those who gave them shelter and helped them , are veritably true believers .
For them is forgiveness and noble sustenance .
Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought by your side , are your brothers ; yet those who are related by blood are closer to one another according to the decree of God .
Verily God knows everything .
IMMUNITY is granted those idolaters by God and his Apostle with whom you have a treaty .
( They can ) move about for four months freely in the land , but should know they cannot escape ( the law of ) God , and that God can put the unbelievers to shame .
A general proclamation is ( made ) this day of the Greater Pilgrimage on the part of God and His Apostle , that God is not bound ( by any contract ) to idolaters , nor is His Apostle .
It is , therefore , better for you to repent . If you do not , remember that you cannot elude ( the grip of ) God .
So announce to those who deny the truth the news of painful punishment ,
Except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty , who have not failed you in the least , nor helped anyone against you .
Fulfil your obligations to them during the term ( of the treaty ) .
God loves those who take heed for themselves .
But when these months , prohibited ( for fighting ) , are over , slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them , and take them captive or besiege them , and lie in wait for them at every likely place .
But if they repent and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat , then let them go their way , for God is forgiving and kind .
If an idolater seeks protection , then give him asylum that he may hear the word of God .
Then escort him to a place of safety , for they are people who do not know .
How could there be a treaty between idolaters and God and His Apostle , except those you covenanted by the Sacred Mosque ?
Therefore as long as they are honest with you be correct with them , for God loves those who are godly .
How ( can they be trusted ) ? If they prevail against you they will neither observe pacts nor good faith with you .
They flatter you with their tongues , but their hearts are averse to you , for most of them are iniquitous .
They barter away the words of God for a petty price , and obstruct ( others ) from His path .
How evil indeed are the things they do !
They have no regard for kinship or treaties with believers , for they are transgressors .
But if they repent and are firm in devotion and pay the zakat , then they are your brothers in faith .
We explain Our commands distinctly for those who understand .
If they break their pledge after giving their word and revile your faith , fight these specimens of faithlessness , for surely their oaths have no sanctity : They may haply desist .
Will you not fight those who broke their pledge and plotted to banish the Apostle , and who were the first to attack you ?
Are you afraid of them ?
If you are believers you should fear God more .
Fight them so that God may punish them at your hands , and put them to shame , and help you against them , and heal the wounds of the hearts of believers ,
And remove the anger from their breasts ; for God turns to whosoever desires .
God is all-knowing and all-wise .
Do you think you will get away before God knows who among you fought and did not take anyone but God , His Apostle and the faithful , as their friends ?
God is cognisant of all that you do .
The idolaters have no right to visit the mosques of God while bearing testimony to their disbelief .
Meaningless will be their acts , and in Hell they will bide for ever ,
Only those who believe in God and the Last Day , who fulfil their devotional obligations , pay the zakat , and fear no one but God , can visit the mosques of God . They may hope to be among the guided .
Do you think that giving a drink of water to the pilgrims and going on a visit to the Sacred Mosque , is the same as believing in God and the Last Day , and striving in the cause of God ?
In the eyes of God it is not the same ; and God does not show the unrighteous the way .
Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of God , wealth and soul , have a greater reward with God , and will be successful .
Their Lord announces to them news of His mercy , acceptance , and gardens of lasting bliss
Which they will enjoy for ever .
Indeed God has greater rewards with Him .
O you who believe , do not hold your fathers and brothers as friends if they hold disbelief more dear than faith ; and those of you who do so are iniquitous .
You tell them : &quot; If your fathers and sons , your brothers and wives and families and wealth , or the business you fear may fail , and the mansions that you love , are dearer to you than God , His Apostle , and struggling in His cause , then wait until God &apos;s command arrives , for God does not show transgressors the way . &quot;
Indeed God has helped you on many occasions , even during the battle of Hunain , when you were elated with joy at your numbers which did not prove of the least avail , so that the earth and its vast expanse became too narrow for you , and you turned back and retreated .
Then God sent down a sense of tranquility on His Apostle and the faithful ; and sent down troops invisible to punish the infidels .
This is the recompense of those who do not believe .
Yet God may turn ( even ) after this to whomsoever He please , for God is compassionate and kind .
O believers , the idolaters are unclean .
So they should not approach the Holy Mosque after this year .
In case you fear indigence ( from the stoppage of business with them ) , then God will enrich you of His bounty if He will , for God is all-knowing and all-wise .
Fight those people of the Book who do not believe in God and the Last Day , who do not prohibit what God and His Apostle have forbidden , nor accept divine law , until all of them pay protective tax in submission .
The Jews say : &quot; Ezra is the son of God ; &quot; the Christians say : &quot; Christ is the son of God . &quot;
That is what they say with their tongues following assertions made by unbelievers before them .
May they be damned by God : How perverse are they !
They consider their rabbis and monks and the Christ , son of Mary , to be gods apart from God , even though they had been enjoined to worship only one God , for there is no god but He .
Too holy is He for what they ascribe to Him !
They wish to extinguish the light of God by uttering blasphemies ; but God will not have it so , for He wills to perfect His light , however the unbelievers be averse .
It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the true faith in order to make it superior to other systems of belief , even though the idolaters may not like it .
O believers , many rabbis and priests devour the possessions of others wrongfully , and keep men away from the path of God .
To those who accumulate gold and silver , and do not spend in the way of God , announce the news of painful punishment .
On the day We shall heat up ( their gold ) on the fire of Hell and brand their foreheads , sides and backs ( and say to them ) : &quot; It is this you stored up for yourselves ; so now taste of what you had stored ! &quot;
The number of months with God is twelve in accordance with God &apos;s law since the day He created the heavens and the earth .
Of these four are holy .
This is the straight reckoning .
So do not exceed yourselves during them ; but fight the idolaters to the end as they fight you in like manner ; and remember , God is with those Who preserve themselves from evil and do the right .
Intercalating a month is adding to unbelief .
The unbelievers are misguided by this , for they take the same month to be sacred one year and sacrilegious the next , thus making the number of months sanctified by God accord with theirs in order to make what God has forbidden , lawful .
Attractive seem to them their evil deeds ; but God does not show the unbelievers the way .
What has happened to you , O believers , that when you are asked to set out in the cause of God your feet begin to drag ?
Do you find the life of the world so pleasing that you forget the life to come ?
Yet the profit of the life of this world is but meagre as compared to the life to come .
Unless you go out ( to strive ) , God will inflict grievous punishment on you , and bring other people in your place , and you will not be able to harm Him in the least , for God has the power over all things .
If you do not help ( the Prophet , remember ) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave ( and he was ) one of two . When both of them were in the cave , he said to his companion : &quot; Do not grieve , for God is with us . &quot;
Then God sent divine peace on him , and invisible armies for his help , and made the unbelievers &apos; purpose abject . Most exalted is God &apos;s word , for God is all-mighty and all-wise .
O believers , go out in the cause of God , ( whether ) light or heavy , and strive in the service of God , wealth and soul .
This is better for you if you understand .
( O Prophet ) , had the gain been close at hand , and easy the journey , they would surely have followed you ; but hard was the journey and long the going .
Even then they swear by God ( and say ) : &quot; If we had the strength we would surely have gone out with you . &quot;
They are only ruining themselves , for God is aware they lie .
May God forgive you .
Why did you allow them ( to stay behind ) without ascertaining who spoke the truth and who were liars ?
Those who believe in God and the Last Day , do not ask your leave to be excused from fighting wealth and soul ( in the cause of God ) , for God knows the pious and devout .
Only they ask ( for leave ) who do not believe in God and the Last Day , whose hearts are full of doubt ; and doubting they waver ( between gain and loss ) .
If they had intended to go out ( to fight ) they would surely have made preparations . But God did not like their setting forth , and they were held back and told : &quot; Stay at home with those who stay behind . &quot;
Had they gone out with you , they would only have been a hindrance and let loose confusion among you to create discord ; for there are some in your midst who spy for them . But God knows who are the wicked .
They had tried to create disorder before and intrigued against you , but truth came out in the end and God &apos;s will prevailed , even though they did not like it .
And ( many a one ) there is among them who says : &quot; Allow me ( to stay back at home ) , and put me not on trial . &quot;
Surely they have put themselves on trial already , and Hell will enclose the unbelievers from all sides .
If good comes your way they are vexed , but if calamity befalls you , they say : &quot; We had taken precautions in advance ; &quot; and pleased , turn away .
Tell them : &quot; Nothing can befall us except what God decrees .
Our protector is He , and in God should the faithful place their trust . &quot;
Say : &quot; Are you waiting for anything else but one of two good things for us , ( victory or martyrdom ) ? Yet what we are waiting for you is the punishment of God , direct or through us .
Tell them : &quot; You may spend ( in the way of God ) , whether willingly or with reluctance , it will not be accepted from you , for you are reprobates . &quot;
Nothing prevents the acceptance of what they spend except that they do not believe in God and His Apostle , and come to worship but languidly and spend only grudgingly .
Do not marvel at their wealth and children .
God intends to punish them through these in the world ; and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief .
They swear by God they are with you , though in fact they are not . They are only a frightened lot .
If they find a place of shelter or a cave or hole to hide , they will turn to it .
There are some among them who blame you ( of partiality ) in distributing the offerings made in the name of God .
In case they receive some of these they are pleased , if not , they are incensed .
They should rather have been pleased with what God and His Prophet had given them , and said : &quot; God is sufficient for us ; He will give us of His largesse as will His Apostle .
We supplicate no one but God . &quot;
Charities are meant for the indigent and needy , and those who collect and distribute them , and those whom you wish to win over , and for redeeming slaves ( and captives ) and those who are burdened with debt , and in the cause of God , and the wayfarers : So does God ordain .
God is all-knowing and all-wise .
There are some among them who talk ill of the Prophet by saying : &quot; He listens to everyone . &quot; Tell them : &quot; He listens for your good , and trusts in God and trusts the faithful , and he is a blessing for those who believe .
For those who offend the Apostle of God there is painful punishment . &quot;
They swear by God to please you ; but if they are believers it would have been worthier to have pleased God and His Apostle .
Have they not realised that anyone who opposes God and His Prophet , will abide in Hell for ever ?
And that is the worst disgrace .
The hypocrites fear lest a Surah is revealed concerning them , exposing what is in their hearts .
Say to them : &quot; Mock as much as you like ; God will surely expose what you dread . &quot;
But if you ask them , they will say : &quot; We were only gossiping and jesting . &quot;
You ask them : &quot; Were you jesting with God , His revelations and His messengers ? &quot;
Do not make excuses : You turned unbelievers after having come to faith .
If We pardon a section of you ( for being frivolous ) , We shall punish the other for being guilty ( of deliberate sin ) .
The hypocrites ( are the same ) whether men or women , the one of them being of the other .
They encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good , and tighten their purses ( when it comes to spending in the way of God ) .
Of God they are oblivious ; so He is oblivious of them .
The hypocrites are indeed transgressors .
God has reserved for hypocrites , whether men or women , and for unbelievers , the fire of Hell , where they will abide for ever .
This is sufficient for them : They have God &apos;s condemnation and lasting torment ,
Like those before you who were greater in strength , had more wealth and children than you , who enjoyed their lot in this world , as you have enjoyed your share like them .
You indulge in idle talk , as they had indulged in vain discourse .
Yet nothing of what they did remains in this world or will in the next , and they are the losers .
Has not the account of those before them come to them , -- of the people of Noah and &apos; Ad and Thamud , of Abraham and Midian , and all the habitations that were destroyed ?
Their apostles had come to them with clear proofs ; and God did not surely wrong them , they wronged themselves .
Those who believe , men and women , befriend one another , and enjoin what is right and prohibit what is wrong . They observe their devotional obligations , pay the zakat , and obey God and His Apostle .
God will be merciful to them , for God is all-mighty and all-wise .
God has promised men and women who believe gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever , and beautiful mansions in the Garden of Eden , and the blessings of God above all .
That will be happiness supreme .
Strive , O Prophet , against the unbelievers and the hypocrites , and deal with them firmly .
Their final abode is Hell : And what a wretched destination !
They swear by God : &quot; We never said this . &quot; But they surely said words disbelieving the truth , and they turned unbelievers after having come to faith , and designed what they could not accomplish .
They did it only out of vengeance for God and His Apostle had enriched them by their grace .
So , if they repent it is better for them . If they turn away then God would afflict them with painful punishment in this world and the next ; and none will they have on the face of the earth to protect or help them .
Some of them made a covenant with God : &quot; If You give us in Your bounty we shall give alms and be upright . &quot;
But when He gave them of His bounty they became greedy , and then turned away .
As a consequence of breaking their promise made to God , and telling lies , he filled their hearts with hypocrisy which will last till the day they come before Him .
Have they not realised that God knows their secrets and their confidential talk , and that God has the knowledge of unknown things ?
They who defame those of the believers who give alms willingly , and deride those who have nothing besides what they earn by their labour ( to give in charity ) , will be derided by God , and will suffer painful punishment .
Whether you plead forgiveness for them or not , God will not forgive them , even though you plead seventy times , for they disbelieved in God and His Apostle ; and God does not show transgressors the way .
Those who were left behind rejoiced that they stayed at home against the wishes of God &apos;s Apostle , being averse to fighting in the way of God with their wealth and lives , and said : &quot; Do not go in this heat . &quot;
Tell them : &quot; The heat of Hell is far more intense . &quot;
If only they had cared to instruct themselves !
So let them laugh a little , for weep they will , more as retribution for what they have done .
If you come back to them by ( the grace of ) God , and they seek your permission to go ( to fight ) , you should tell them : &quot; You will never go out nor fight the enemy with me any more .
You preferred to stay back on the first occasion , so stay at home with those who stay behind . &quot;
Do not invoke blessings on any of them who die , nor stand to pray at their graves , for they disbelieved in God and His Prophet , and died transgressors .
And let not their wealth and children astonish you .
God wishes to punish them through these in the world , and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief .
Whenever a Surah is revealed ( which says ) : &quot; Believe in God and fight along with His Prophet , &quot; the well-to-do among them ask for leave to stay at home , and say : &quot; Leave us with those who are left behind . &quot;
They prefer to be with women who ( are allowed to ) stay at home during war , and their hearts are sealed ; so they fail to understand .
But the Prophet and those who have embraced the faith with him , and have fought wealth and soul ( in the way of God ) , are blessed and will be successful .
God has provision for them of gardens with Streams of running water , where they will abide for ever .
This will be the supreme triumph .
Some Arabs of the desert came with ready excuses , asking for leave to stay behind . But those who had lied to God and His Prophet stayed at home doing nothing .
So the punishment for those who disbelieve among them will be painful .
No blame will attach to the old and the sick , or those without means to spend on good acts , if they stay behind provided they are sincere to God and His Apostle ; There is no way to blame those who are doers of good , for God is forgiving and kind .
Nor will they be blamed who came to you for transport , to whom you said : &quot; I cannot find any means of conveyance for you , &quot; and they went away in tears , grieving that they lacked the means to spend ( on carriage ) .
Blame will lie on those who are rich yet ask your leave to stay behind .
They prefer to stay with women who stay at home , and God seals their hearts ; so they do not understand .
When you come back they will offer excuses to you .
Tell them : &quot; Make no excuses ; we do not believe you .
God has informed us about you ; and God and His Apostle shall watch your conduct .
Then you will be brought to Him who knows what is hidden and what is manifest . He will tell you of what you did . &quot;
They will beg you in the name of God , on your return , to forgive them ; but you keep away from them : They are scum ; their abode is Hell : Requital for what they had done .
They will plead on oath that you accept them .
Even if you accept them , remember God does not accept people who are disobedient .
The village Arabs are more obstinate in disbelief and hypocrisy , and impervious to ordinances revealed to His Apostle by God ; yet God is aware of everything and is wise .
Some of these rustics take whatever they spend in the way of God as a penalty , and wait for an adverse turn in your fortune .
For them will be the adverse change , as God hears all and knows everything .
Yet some Arabs of the desert believe in God and the Last Day , and consider what they spend to be a means of bringing them nearer to God and the blessings of the Prophet .
This is certainly a means of achieving nearness ( to God ) , and God will admit them to His mercy , for God is forgiving and kind .
Those among the migrants ( from Makkah ) and helpers ( in Madina ) who were the first to believe , and those who followed them in goodness , have been accepted by God and they follow His way .
For them He has gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever ; and that is happiness supreme .
Some of the Arabs of the desert around you are hypocrites , and some of the people of Madina are stubborn in hypocrisy . You are not aware of them ; We know them , and will punish them twice , and they will be sent to a harrowing doom .
But there are others who admit their sins of mixing good deeds with evil .
It may be that God will accept their repentance , for God is forgiving and kind .
Accept the offerings they make from their wealth in order to cleanse and purify them for progress , and invoke blessings upon them .
Your blessings will surely bring them peace , for God hears all and knows everything .
Do they not know that God accepts the repentance of His creatures and receives what they offer in charity , and that He is forgiving and kind ?
Say to them : &quot; Act .
God will see your conduct , and so will His Apostle and the faithful ; for you will in the end go back to Him , who knows the unknown and the known , who will tell you of what you were doing . &quot;
There are still some others whose affairs await the dispensation of God .
He may punish or pardon them , for God is all-knowing and all-wise .
There are those who built a mosque on opposition and disbelief , and to cause rifts among the faithful , and to serve as an outpost for those who have warred against God and His Apostle before this .
Yet they will surely swear : &quot; We had only meant well . &quot; But God is witness that they are liars .
Never set foot in that place . Only a mosque whose foundations have been laid from the very first on godliness is worthy of your visiting it .
There you will find men who wish to be purified ; and God loves those who are pure .
Is the man who lays the foundations of his sanctum on his allegiance to God and the wish to seek His favour , better , or he who lays the foundations of his building on the edge of a bank eroded by water , which will collapse with him into the fire of Hell ?
But God does not guide the people who are wilfully unjust .
The edifice they have built will always fill their minds with perturbation ( which will not cease ) till their hearts are rent to pieces , for God is all-knowing and all-wise .
God has verily bought the souls and possessions of the faithful in exchange for a promise of Paradise . They fight in the cause of God , and kill and are killed .
This is a promise incumbent on Him , as in the Torah , so the Gospel and the Qur &apos;an .
And who is more true to his promise than God ? So rejoice at the bargain you have made with Him ; for this will be triumph supreme .
To those who repent and pay homage , give praise and are devout , who kneel in prayer and bow in supplication , who enjoin good deeds and prohibit the bad , and keep to the limits set by God , announce the news of rejoicing to the faithful .
It is not worthy of the Prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for those who are idolaters , even though they may be their relatives , after they have come to know that they are destined for Hell .
As for Abraham &apos;s prayer for his father , he was fulfilling a promise he had made to him . Yet when it became evident to him that ( his father ) was an enemy of God , he broke away from him , though Abraham was soft hearted and kind .
God never leads men astray after guiding them , until He makes quite clear to them what they should avoid , for God indeed knows each and everything .
Verily God &apos;s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth .
He alone is the giver of life and death ; and none do you have besides God as friend and helper .
God was kind to the Prophet , the emigrants , and the helpers of the faithful who followed him in the hour of distress .
When a section of them were about to lose courage He turned to them in His mercy , for He is compassionate and kind .
He has relented towards the three also ( who had refused to go to the battle of the Ditch ) whose case was left undecided , and even the earth with all its expanse had become narrow for them , and their lives were confined , and they came to realise there was no refuge for them except in God .
So He softened towards them that they may repent ; for God surely accepts repentance and is merciful .
O believers , do not stray from the path of God , and be with those who are truthful .
It was not worthy of the people of Madina , and the Arabs of the desert around them , to abandon the Prophet of God , and to care more for themselves than for him ; for there is no hardship or thirst or hunger that they know in the service of God , and no place they walk on where walking provokes the unbelievers , and no harm they receive from the enemy , but is put down as a good deed in their favour .
Surely God does not let the recompense of those who do good to go waste .
There is not a sum , large or small , that they spend , not a piece of land that they traverse ( in the service of God ) which is not put down in their favour , so that God could reward them for what they had done .
It is not possible for all believers to go out ( to fight ) .
So a part of each section ( of the population ) should go ( to fight ) in order that the others may acquire understanding of law and divinity , and warn their companions on return so that they may take heed for themselves .
O believers , fight the unbelievers around you , and let them realise that you are firm : Remember , God is with those who are pious and obedient to Him .
When a Surah is revealed some of them remark : &quot; Whose faith among you has it increased ? &quot;
It does increase the faith of those who believe , and they rejoice .
But it adds disbelief to disbelief for those whose hearts are filled with doubt , and they die disbelieving .
Do they not know that they are tried every year once or twice ?
Even then they do not repent and take heed .
Whenever a Surah is revealed they look at each other ( so as to ask ) : &quot; Is anyone looking at Us ? &quot; and then turn away .
Indeed God has turned their hearts away ( from the truth ) , for they cannot discern the law of heaven .
To you has come an Apostle from among you . Any sorrow that befalls you weighs upon him ; He is eager for your happiness , full of concern for the faithful , compassionate and kind .
So , if they turn away , say to them : &quot; God is sufficient for me .
There is no God but He ; I depend on Him alone , the Lord of the glorious Throne . &quot;
ALIF LAM RA . These are the verses of the authoritative Book .
Are the people astonished that a man who is one of them was commanded by Us to warn them and to bring glad tidings to those who believe that they have a true precedence with their Lord ?
( Yet ) the unbelievers say : &quot; He is a clear sorcerer . &quot;
Your Lord is God who created the heavens and the earth in six spans , then assumed His power , dispensing all affairs .
None can intercede with Him except by His leave .
He is God , your Lord , so worship Him .
Will you not be warned ?
To Him will you all return : God &apos;s promise is true .
It is He who originates creation , then will revert it , so that He may reward those who believe and do good things in all justice . But those who deny the truth will receive boiling water to drink and grievous punishment , for they disbelieved .
It is He who gave the sun its radiance , the moon its lustre , and appointed its stations so that you may compute years and numbers .
God did not create them but with deliberation .
He distinctly explains His signs for those who can understand .
In the alternation of night and day , and all that He has created in the heavens and the earth , are certainly signs for people who fear God .
As for those who do not hope to meet Us ( after death ) , and are content with the life of this world , who are oblivious of Our signs ,
Will have Hell as their abode for what they have earned .
But those who believe and act for a beneficial end will be guided by their Lord for their good faith .
At their feet shall flow streams of running water in gardens of delight .
Their invocation will be : &quot; All glory to you , O God , &quot; and &quot; Peace &quot; will be their salutation , and the end of their prayer ( will be ) : &quot; All praise be to God , the Lord of all the worlds . &quot;
If God were to hasten the evil , as men try to hasten the good , their term would come to end .
So We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander perplexed in transgression .
When man is afflicted with adversity he calls to Us , whether lying on his side , or sitting or standing . But when We take away his troubles , he moves away , as though he had never called to Us in affliction .
In the same way , attractive have been made their deeds to the prodigals .
How many generations did We lay low before you when they became wilfully unjust . Their apostles had brought clear proofs to them , yet they never believed .
So We punished the sinful people .
Then We appointed you leaders in the land after them to see how you behaved .
When Our clear messages are recited to them , those who do not hope to meet Us , say : &quot; Bring a different Qur &apos;an , or make amendments to this one . &quot;
Say : &quot; It is not for me to change it of my will .
I follow ( only ) what is revealed to me .
If I disobey my Lord , I fear the punishment of an awful Day . &quot;
Say : &quot; Had God pleased I would never have recited it to you , nor would He have given you comprehension of it .
( Remember that I am one of you ) and have lived a whole life with you before ( its revelation ) . Even then you do not understand . &quot;
Who is more unjust than he who imputes lies to God or denies His revelations ?
The sinners will surely not be reprieved .
They worship those besides God who cannot do them harm or bring them gain , and say : &quot; These are our intercessors with God . &quot;
Say : &quot; Do you want to inform God of things in the heavens and the earth He does not know ? &quot;
Glorious is He , and too exalted for what they associate with Him !
Men were once a community of one faith ; but they differed ( and followed different ways ) . Had it not been for the word proclaimed by your Lord before , their differences would have been resolved .
They say : &quot; How is it that no sign was sent by his Lord ( to His Prophet ) ? &quot;
Tell them : &quot; Unknown things are only known to God .
So watch and wait ( for the sign ) ; I am waiting and expecting with you . &quot;
When We let them taste Our mercy after affliction , they contrive against Our signs .
Say : &quot; God is swifter at contriving , &quot; for Our angels record everything you plan .
It is He who enables you to travel over land and sea .
When you sail in ships in a favourable breeze , you rejoice . But when a gale begins to blow and the waves dash against them from every side they realise that they have been caught in it , ( and ) they call on God in all faith : &quot; If You save us from this we shall ever be grateful . &quot;
But when He rescues them , they commit excesses in the land unjustly again .
Your rebellion , O people , shall recoil back on your own selves .
The joys of the world ( are only ephemeral ) : You have to come back to Us in the end . We shall then inform you what you were doing .
The life of the world is like the rain that waters the crops of the earth which are used as food by men and cattle . But when the earth is embellished and adorned with gold , and its tillers begin to feel that ( the crops ) are under control , Our command descends suddenly at night or in the day , and We mow them down as though there was nothing there yesterday .
This is how We distinctly explain Our signs to those who think .
God invites you to mansions of peace , and guides whosoever He will to the path that is straight
For those who do good there is goodness and more , and no blot or disgrace will cover their faces .
They are people of Paradise , where they will abide for ever .
But those who earn evil shall be punished to an equal degree as their evil , and they will be covered with shame , and will have none to protect them against God : Their faces shall be blackened as though with patches of the night .
They are the people of Hell , where they will abide for ever ,
The day We shall gather them all together We shall say to the idolaters : &quot; Take your stand with the compeers you worshipped as the equals of God . &quot;
We shall then create a rift between them , and the compeers will say : &quot; You did not worship us ;
For God is sufficient as witness between us and you we were not aware of your worship . &quot;
Then each will see what he had done in the past ; and they will turn to God , their true Lord , and all the lies they had fabricated will be of no avail to them .
Ask them : &quot; Who gives you food and sustenance from the skies and the earth ?
Or , who is the lord of ear and eye ?
And who brings forth the living from the dead , the dead from the living ?
And who directs all affairs ? &quot;
They will say : &quot; God . &quot;
So tell them : &quot; Why do you not fear Him ? &quot;
Such then is God , your true Lord ; and when truth is gone what is left but error ?
So why do you turn away ?
Thus the word of your Lord about those who disobey comes true , that they do not believe .
Ask them : &quot; Is there among the partners ( you ascribe to God ) one who first originates then reverts it ?
Say : &quot; It is God alone who first creates and then reverts it .
So where do you stray ? &quot;
Ask : &quot; Is there one among those you associate with God who can show the way to the truth ? &quot;
Say : &quot; It is God who shows the way to truth . &quot;
Then who is more worthy of being followed -- He who guides to the truth , or he who cannot find the path until shown the way ?
What has happened to you that you judge in such a wise ?
Many of them follow nothing but illusion ; yet illusion cannot replace the reality .
God verily knows what they do .
This Qur &apos;an is not such ( a writ ) as could be composed by anyone but God .
It confirms what has been revealed before , and is an exposition of ( Heaven &apos;s ) law . Without any doubt it &apos;s from the Lord of all the worlds .
Do they say ( of the Prophet ) that : &quot; He has composed it ? &quot;
Say to them : &quot; Bring a Surah like this , and call anyone apart from God you can ( to help you ) , if what you say is true . &quot;
In fact , they deny what is beyond the reach of their knowledge , whose explanation has not reached them yet .
So had those who have gone before them denied ; but look at the fate of the unjust
Some of them will believe in it , some will not . Your Lord knows the transgressors well .
If they ( still ) call you a liar , tell them : &quot; For me my actions , for you yours .
You are not answerable for my deeds , nor I for what you do . &quot;
Some of them listen to you : But can you make the deaf hear who do not understand a thing ?
Some of them look toward you : But can you show the blind the way even when they cannot see ?
Surely God does not wrong anyone ; they wrong themselves .
The day He will gather them together it will appear to them that they had lived ( in the world ) but an hour of a day to make each other &apos;s acquaintance .
Verily those who deny the meeting with God will be lost , and not find the way .
Whether We show you some of the promise ( of punishment in wait ) for them , or take you to Ourself , their returning is to Us in the end ; and God is a witness to all they do .
For every people there is an apostle ; and when their apostle is come the matter is decided between them equitably , and no one is wronged .
They say : &quot; When is this promise going to come , if what you say is true ? &quot;
Say : &quot; I have no power over my own gain or loss other than what God may please . &quot;
Every people have a certain term . When their time is come they can neither delay it an hour nor advance it a moment forward .
Say : &quot; Have you ever thought if His punishment befalls you at night or in the day , what would the sinners do to despatch it ?
Will you believe it when it comes to pass ?
Indeed , you will believe it then .
How impatient you were to hasten it !
Then will the sinners be told : &quot; Now taste everlasting torment .
Should you be rewarded for anything else but what you did ? &quot;
Yet they want to be informed if it is true .
Say : &quot; By my Lord , it is the truth .
You cannot invalidate it . &quot;
Even if every soul that has sinned possessed whatever is on the earth , it would surely offer it to ransom itself , and feel repentant on seeing the punishment .
Yet the sentence would be passed with justice , and not one will be wronged .
For all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God .
Remember , the promise of God is true .
But most of them do not know .
He is the giver of life and death , and to Him you will return .
O men , a warning has come to you from your Lord , a remedy for the ( doubts ) of the heart , and a guidance and grace for those who believe .
Say : &quot; It is the blessing and mercy of God ; so rejoice in it .
It is better than all that you amass . &quot;
Say : &quot; Have you thought of what God has sent you for food , of which you have labelled some as lawful and some forbidden ? &quot;
And ask : &quot; Has God commanded this , or you are imputing lies to God ? &quot;
What do those who invent lies of God think about the Day of Reckoning ?
( Will they escape the judgement ? ) In fact God is gracious to men ; but most of them are not grateful .
There is no state you are in , whether reading from the Qur &apos;an , or doing something else , but We are watching you as you are engaged in it .
There is not the weight of an atom on the earth and in the heavens that is hidden from your Lord , nor is there anything smaller or greater than this but is recorded in the perspicuous Book .
Remember , there is neither fear nor regret for the friends of God .
Those who believe and obey God ,
For them is good news in the life of the world and in the life to come . There is no changing the words of God .
You should not be grieved by what they say .
All glory is wholly for God : He is the one who hears and knows everything .
Remember , whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God .
Those who call on others they associate with God , follow nothing but conjecture , and only guess .
It is He who made the night for you to rest , and made the day enlightening .
Indeed there are signs in this for those who listen .
They say : &quot; God has begotten a son . &quot;
Immaculate is He and self-sufficient . &quot;
Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him .
You have no proof for this ( assertion ) : Why do you say things of God you do not know ?
Say : &quot; Those who fabricate lies about God will never succeed . &quot;
Let them profit by the world ( while they may ) : In the end they will come back to Us .
Then We shall make them taste severe punishment for having denied ( the truth ) .
Recount to them the story of Noah when he said to his people : &quot; O people , if you find my staying with you and warning through God &apos;s signs , unbearable to you , know that I have reposed my trust in God . So plan your move , and call your associates , and make certain of your plan ; then do whatever you intend against me , allowing me no respite .
If you turn away from me ( remember ) I do not ask any recompense from you .
My reward is with God ; I have been commanded to be one of those who submit to Him . &quot;
Even then they denied him ; so We saved him and those with him , in the ark , and established them in the land , and drowned those who denied Our signs .
So think of the fate of those who were warned ( and took no heed ) .
Afterwards We sent many messengers who brought clear proofs to their peoples .
But they were not prepared to believe what they had once denied .
That is how We seal the hearts of the iniquitous .
Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron with Our signs to the Pharaoh and his nobles ; but they behaved arrogantly , for they were a people full of guilt .
Thus , when the truth had come to them from Us , they said : &quot; Surely this is nothing but pure magic . &quot;
&quot; You say this of the truth , &quot; said Moses , &quot; after it has come to you .
Is this magic ?
But sorcerers do not ever prosper . &quot;
&quot; Have you come , &quot; said they , &quot; to turn us back from what we found our ancestors doing , so that the two of you may attain supremacy in the land ?
We shall not believe in what you say .
&quot; Bring the cleverest magicians to me , &quot; said the Pharaoh .
So when the magicians arrived , Moses said to them : &quot; Cast whatever ( spell ) you have to cast . &quot;
When they had cast ( their spell ) Moses said : &quot; What you have cast is only a charm which God will surely nullify .
God does not verily render the deeds of evil-doers righteous .
God vindicates the truth by His commands , however the sinners may dislike it . &quot;
But none of them put faith in Moses except some youths among his people who were nonetheless afraid lest the Pharaoh and his nobles should persecute them ; for the Pharaoh was mighty in the land , and guilty of excesses .
Moses said : &quot; O my people , if you do believe in God place your trust in Him if you are obedient . &quot;
They answered : &quot; We have placed our trust in God .
O Lord , do not make us a target of oppression for these tyrannical people ,
And deliver us by Your grace from a people who do not believe . &quot;
We commanded Moses and his brother : &quot; Build homes for your people in Egypt , and make your houses places of worship , perform your acts of prayer and give happy tidings to those who believe . &quot;
And Moses said : &quot; O Lord , have You bestowed on the Pharaoh and his nobles pomp and plenty in the life of this world that they might mislead people from Your path ?
Destroy their possessions , O Lord , and harden their hearts that they may not believe until they face the painful punishment . &quot;
Said ( the Lord ) : &quot; Your prayer is answered .
Therefore persist and do not follow the path of those who are ignorant . &quot;
And We brought the people of Israel across the sea , but the Pharaoh and his army pursued them wickedly and maliciously till he was on the point of drowning , and he said : &quot; I believe that there is no god but He in whom the people of Israel believe , and I submit to Him . &quot;
&quot; Yes , now &quot; ( was the answer ) , &quot; though before this you were disobedient and rebellious .
We shall preserve your body today that you may be a lesson for those who come after you ; as many a man is heedless of Our signs . &quot;
We gave the people of Israel a settled abode , and bestowed good things on them to eat and use . So they did not differ until they came to have knowledge .
Your Lord will assuredly settle their differences on the Day of Resurrection .
If you are in doubt of what We have sent down to you , then ask those who have been reading the Book ( for a long time ) before you .
The truth has indeed come to you from your Lord , so do not be one of those who doubt ,
And do not be one of those who deny the signs of God , or you will be among the losers .
Verily those against whom the word of your Lord is pronounced will never believe ,
Even though all the signs came to them , not till they face the grievous punishment .
Why has there been no habitation that believed and profited by their faith , except the people of Jonah ?
When they came to believe , We removed from them the affliction of shame in the world , and made them prosperous for a time .
If your Lord had willed , all the people on the earth would have come to believe , one and all .
Are you going to compel the people to believe except by God &apos;s dispensation ?
He puts doubt in ( the minds of ) those who do not think .
Say : &quot; Observe all there is in the heavens and the earth . &quot;
But signs or warnings will be of no avail to those who do not believe .
Can they expect anything but what the people before them had known ?
Say : &quot; Then wait . I am waiting with you . &quot;
Thus do We deliver our apostles and those who believe .
As a matter of duty We save the believers .
Say : &quot; O men , if you have doubt about my faith , then ( know ) I do not worship those you worship apart from God , but I worship God who makes you die ; and I am commanded to be a believer ,
And to set my face toward the way , as one upright , and not be one of those who associate others with God .
And not to invoke any other than God , who can neither help nor hurt me ; for if I do , I would surely be unjust .
Should God bring you harm there is none but He who could deliver you from it , and if He wish you good there is none who could take away His blessings : He showers them on those of His creatures as He please , and He is forgiving and kind . &quot;
Say : &quot; O men , the truth has come to you from your Lord , so he who follows the right path does so for himself , and he who goes astray errs against himself , and I am not a guardian over you .
Follow what is revealed to you , and persist until God pronounce His judgement ; for He is the best of all judges . &quot;
ALIF LAM RA . This is a Book whose verses are indeclinable and distinct , which comes from One who is most wise and all-knowing ,
( Proclaiming ) that you should worship none but God .
Verily I bring to you from Him a message of warning and rejoicing ,
And that you should seek His forgiveness and turn towards Him .
He will bestow the best things of life on you for a time ordained , and favour those with blessings who are worthy of grace .
But if you turn away , I fear the punishment of a terrible Day for you .
To God have you to go back , and He has power over everything .
Look , how they double up their breasts in order to hide from Him .
But when they cover themselves up with their garments , He knows what they hide and what they expose .
Indeed , He knows the secrets of the hearts .
There is not a creature that moves on the earth whose nourishment is not provided by God , whose place of sojourning and depositing is not known to Him .
All things conform to a manifest law .
It is He who created the heavens and the earth In six spans , and has control over the waters ( of life ) so that he may bring out the best that everyone of you could do .
Yet if you said to them : &quot; You shall certainly be raised from the dead , &quot; the unbelievers will say : &quot; This will be nothing but sorcery . &quot;
If We defer their punishment for a certain time , they will say : &quot; What is keeping it back ? &quot;
And yet , the day it comes , they will not be able to avert it ; and what they used to laugh at will encompass them .
If We allow man to enjoy Our favours , and then take them away from him , he becomes despondent and ungrateful .
If We let him taste Our favours after adversity , he says : &quot; Misfortune has left me , &quot; and begins to brag and exult ,
Except those who endure with patience and do the right , who will have pardon and a great reward .
You may haply omit some of what has been revealed to you , and may be disheartened because they say : &quot; Why was no treasure sent down to him , or an angel accompanied him ? &quot;
Yet you have been sent to warn alone , for God takes care of everything .
Do they say ( of the Prophet ) : &quot; He has forged ( the Qur &apos;an ) ? &quot;
Say : &quot; Then bring ten Surahs like it , and call anyone except God to help you , if what you say is true . &quot;
If they do not answer you , then know it has been revealed with the knowledge of God , and that there is no god but He .
( And say : ) &quot; Will you now submit ? &quot;
To those who desire the life of this world and its many allures , We shall pay them in full for their acts herein and will not withold any thing .
Yet these are the people for whom there is nothing but Fire in the world to come . Fruitless will be what they have fashioned , and whatever they have done will perish .
Will he who has a clear proof from his Lord , which acts as evidence from Him , before which the Book of Moses was a way-giver and a grace , ( not believe in it ) ?
Whoever among the partisans does not believe in it shall have Hell as the promised award .
So have no doubt about it , for surely it &apos;s the truth from your Lord , though most men may not believe .
Who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God ?
Such men shall be arraigned before their Lord , and the witnesses will testify : &quot; These are those who imputed lies to God . &quot;
Beware !
The scourge of God will fall on the unjust ,
Who obstruct others from the way of God and seek obliquity in it , and do not believe in the life to come .
They shall not weaken ( the power of ) God on earth , nor find any other protector but God .
Their punishment will be doubled , for they could neither hear nor see .
They are verily those who exceeded themselves , and the ( gods ) they invented abandoned them .
Undoubtedly they will be losers in the life to come .
But those who believe and do things good , and are humble before their Lord , are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever .
The semblance of these two groups is that of a man who is deaf and blind , and the other who can hear and see .
Can they be equal ?
Why do you not reflect ?
We sent Noah to his people ( and he said ) : &quot; I give you a clear warning .
Do not worship anyone but God ; for I fear the punishment of a dreadful day for you . &quot;
The leaders of the people who were unbelievers , replied : &quot; We see that you are but a man like us , and see that none among us follows you but the meanest and immature of judgement , and do not see any excellence in you above us . In fact , we think you are a liar . &quot;
He said : &quot; O my people , think . If I have a clear proof from my Lord , and He has bestowed on me His grace , though unknown to you , can we force it upon you when you are averse ?
I do not demand for it any wealth from you , O my people .
My reward is with God .
And I will not drive those away who believe .
They have also to meet their Lord .
But I see you are an ignorant people .
O my people , who will save me from God if I drive them away ?
Do you not understand ?
I say not that I have the treasures of God , or that I possess the knowledge of the unknown .
I do not claim to be an angel , nor can I say that God will not bestow any good on those you disdain , for God is cognisant of what is in their hearts . If I say this , I will surely be unjust . &quot;
They said : &quot; O Noah , you have argued with us , and disputed at length ; so bring that ( retribution ) you promise , if you speak the truth . &quot;
He replied : &quot; Only God will bring it on you if He please , and you cannot prevail against Him .
Even if I wish to advise you aright , my counsel will not profit you if God intend that you go astray , for He is your Lord and to Him you will return . &quot;
Do they say you have fabricated it ?
Tell them : &quot; If I have fabricated it , then mine is the guilt ; but I am clear of what you are guilty . &quot;
And Noah was informed through revelation : &quot; Apart from those who have come to believe already not one of your people is going to believe . So grieve not for what they are doing .
Build an ark under Our eye and as We instruct . Do not plead for those who have been wicked , for they shall certainly be drowned . &quot;
So he built the ark ; and when groups of his people passed by him , they scoffed at him .
He said to them : &quot; Though you laugh at us ( now ) , we shall laugh at you , as you are laughing at us .
You will soon come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame , and who suffers lasting torment . &quot;
When Our command was issued and the waters gushed forth from the source , We said : &quot; Take into ( the ark ) a pair of every species , and members of your family other than those against whom the sentence has been passed already , and those who come to believe . &quot;
But only a few believed in him .
And ( Noah ) said : &quot; Embark .
In the name of God be its course and mooring .
My Lord is surely forgiving and kind . &quot;
It sailed on waves like mountains ( high ) , and Noah called to his son who was separated from him : &quot; Embark with us , O my son , and be not one of those who do not believe . &quot;
&quot; I shall go up a mountain , &quot; he said , &quot; which will keep me from the water . &quot;
&quot; There is no getting away , &quot; said Noah , &quot; from the decree of God today , except for those on whom be His mercy . &quot;
And a wave came between them , and he was among those who were drowned .
Then it was said : &quot; O earth , swallow back your water ; and , O sky , desist . &quot;
And the water subsided , and the decree was accomplished .
The ark came to rest on Judi ( Mount Ararat ) , and it was said : &quot; Away with the cursed people ! &quot;
Noah called on his Lord and said : &quot; O Lord , my son is surely a member of my family , and verily Your promise is true , as You are the most just of all judges . &quot;
&quot; O Noah &quot; , He answered , &quot; truly he is not of your family . He is surely the outcome of an unrighteous act .
So ask Me not of what you do not know .
I warn you not to be one of the ignorant . &quot;
&quot; Preserve me , O Lord , &quot; said ( Noah ) , &quot; from asking You that of which I have no knowledge .
If You do not forgive me and have mercy on me I shall be among those who perish . &quot;
( And the Lord ) said : &quot; O Noah , disembark with peace and safety from Us and blessings on you and the people with you .
As for some ( of them ) , We shall bestow advantages for a time , then send a grievous punishment on them . &quot;
This is news of the Unknown We reveal to you , which neither you nor your people knew before .
So endure with patience .
The future is for those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path .
We sent to the people of &apos; Ad their brother Hud , who said : &quot; O my people , worship God ; you have no other god but He .
( As for the idols , ) you are only inventing lies .
O my people , I ask no recompense of you for it : My reward is with Him who created me .
Will you not , therefore , understand ?
O my people , beg your Lord to forgive you , and turn to Him in repentance . He will send down rain in torrents for you from the shies , and give you added strength .
So do not turn away from Him as sinners . &quot;
They said : &quot; O Hud , you have come to us with no proofs . We shall not abandon our gods because you say so , nor believe in you .
All we can say is that some of our gods have smitten you with evil . &quot;
He replied : &quot; I call God to witness , and you be witness too , that I am clear of what you associate ( in your affairs )
Apart from Him . Contrive against me as much as you like , and give me no respite .
I place my trust in God who is my Lord and your Lord .
There is no creature that moves on the earth who is not held by the forelock firmly by Him .
Verily the way of my Lord is straight .
If you turn away , then ( remember ) I have delivered to you the message I was sent with . My Lord will put other people in your place , and you will not be able to prevail against Him .
Indeed my Lord keeps a watch over all things . &quot;
So , when Our command was issued We rescued Hud by Our grace , and those who believed , with him , and saved them from a dreadful doom .
These were the people of &apos; Ad who denied the word of their Lord and rebelled against His apostles , and followed the bidding of every perverse tyrant .
So they were accursed in the world , and they will be damned on the Day of Doom . Beware !
The &apos; Ad turned away from their Lord .
Accursed are the people of &apos; Ad who were Hud &apos;s . To Thamud We Sent their brother Saleh .
&quot; O my people , &quot; he said , &quot; worship God ; you have no other god but He .
It is He who raised you from the earth and settled you upon it .
So beg your Lord to forgive you , and turn to Him in repentance . Surely my Lord is near and answers . &quot;
They said : &quot; O Saleh , we had placed our hopes in you , but you forbid us from worshipping that which our fathers worshipped , and we are suspicious of what you are calling us to . &quot;
He said : &quot; O my people , have you considered that if my Lord has clearly shown me the way , and I have His blessings too , who will save me then from God if I disobey ?
You will only add to my ruin .
O my people , this she-camel of God is a token for you . So leave her alone to graze on God &apos;s earth , and do not molest her , otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you . &quot;
But they hamstrung her . Then ( Saleh ) said : &quot; You have but three days to enjoy life in your homes .
Infallible is this promise .
So , when Our command ( of punishment ) came We delivered Saleh by Our grace , and those who believed , with him , from the disgrace of that day .
Verily your Lord is mighty and powerful .
The sinners were seized by a blast from heaven , and lay overturned in their homes in the morning ,
As though they had never lived there at all . Beware !
The people of Thamud turned away from their Lord . Beware !
Our angels came to Abraham with good news , and said : &quot; Peace on you .
&quot; Peace on you too , &quot; said Abraham , and hastened to bring a roasted calf .
When they did not stretch their hands towards it he became suspicious and afraid of them .
They said : &quot; Do not be afraid . We have been sent to the people of Lot . &quot;
His wife who stood near , laughed as We gave her the good news of Isaac , and after Isaac of Jacob .
She said : &quot; Woe betide me !
Will I give birth when I am old and this my husband be aged ?
This is indeed surprising ! &quot;
&quot; Why are you surprised at the command of God ?
God &apos;s mercy and blessings be upon you , O members of this household , &quot; they said .
&quot; Verily He is worthy of praise and glory . &quot;
When Abraham &apos;s fear was dispelled , and the good news had come to him , he pleaded for the people of Lot with Us .
Abraham was kind , compassionate , and penitent .
&quot; Desist from pleading , O Abraham , &quot; ( they said ) .
&quot; Your Lord &apos;s command has verily been issued , and a punishment that cannot be averted is bound to fall on them . &quot;
So when Our angels came to Lot , he grieved for them , and felt powerless to help them , and said : &quot; This is a day of sorrow .
His people came excited to him . They were addicted to sin already .
Said ( Lot ) : &quot; O my people , these daughters of mine are cleaner ( and lawful ) for you . Have fear of God , and do not shame me before my guests .
Is there no man of discernment among you ? &quot;
They said : &quot; You know we have no need for your daughters , and know well what we want . &quot;
&quot; I wish I had the power to resist you , &quot; said ( Lot ) , &quot; or powerful support . &quot;
( The angels ) said : &quot; O Lot , we have verily been sent by your Lord .
They will never be able to harm you .
So , leave late at night with your family , and none of you should turn back to look ; but your wife will suffer ( the fate ) they are going to suffer .
Their hour of doom is in the morning : Is not the morning nigh ? &quot;
So when the decreed moment arrived , We turned the habitations upside down , and rained upon them stones of hardened lava in quick succession ,
Impressed with ( the signs ) of your Lord .
And such ( punishment ) is not far for the ( other ) transgressers .
We sent to Midian their brother Shu &apos;aib .
He said : &quot; O my people , worship God ; you have no other god but He .
So do not give in short measure nor underweigh .
I see you are prosperous , but I fear the doom of an overwhelming Day for you .
So , O my people , weigh and measure with justness , and do not withhold things due to men , and do not spread corruption in the land , despoiling it .
That which is left to you by God is better , if you are true believers ; yet I am not a warden over you . &quot;
They said : &quot; O Shu &apos;aib , does your piety teach that we should abandon what our fathers worshipped , or desist from doing what we like with our goods ?
How gracious a man of discernment you are indeed ! &quot;
He said : &quot; O my people , think . I have a clear sign from my Lord , who has also given me a goodly provision , and I do not wish for myself what I forbid you : I only wish to reform you as best I can .
My success is from God alone .
In Him I have placed my trust , and to Him I turn .
&quot; O my people ( I fear ) lest your opposition to me should bring you the like of what befell the people of Noah or Hud or Saleh ; and the people of Lot are not distant from you .
&quot; Beg your Lord to forgive you , and turn to Him .
Indeed my Lord is compassionate and loving . &quot;
They said : &quot; O Shu &apos;aib , much of what you say is meaningless to us , and then ( for sure ) you are powerless among us .
But for your clan we would have stoned you to death .
You have no power over us .
He said : &quot; My clan seems mightier to you than God whom you neglect and push behind your backs .
Surely what you do is within the power of my Lord .
Do on your part what you can , O people , I will do what I will . You will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame , and who is the liar .
So watch ; I am watching with you . &quot;
And when Our word came to pass , We rescued Shu &apos;aib and those who believed , with him , by Our grace , but those who were wicked were seized by a punishment from heaven , and lay overturned in their homes in the morning .
As though they had not dwelt there at all .
Beware ! Condemmed were the people of Midian as those of Thamud had been before them !
We sent Moses with Our signs and full authority
To the Pharaoh and his nobles , but they followed the bidding of Pharaoh , though the bidding of Pharaoh was unrightful .
He shall be at the head of his people on the Day of Resurrection , and drive them into Hell like cattle driven to water -- what an evil watering-place to reach !
Damned will they be in this world , and on the Day of Doom how evil the gift that they will receive !
These are a few accounts of settlements that We narrate to you .
Some still survive , and some have been mowed down .
We did not wrong them ; they wronged themselves . When your Lord &apos;s chastisement descended upon them , their gods , on whom they called apart from God , were not of the least avail , and all they did was only to add to their destruction .
Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes human settlements in the acts of wickedness .
Surely His hold is grievous and terrible .
In this surely is a sign for him who fears the torment of the Hereafter , the day when mankind will be assembled together , which will be a day when all things would become evident .
We are deferring it only for a time ordained .
The day it comes no soul will dare say a word but by His leave ; and some will be wretched , some will be blessed .
And those who are doomed , will be in Hell : For them will be sighing and sobbing ,
Where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth endure , unless your Lord will otherwise .
Verily your Lord does as He wills .
Those who are blessed will be in Paradise , where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth survive , unless your Lord wills otherwise : This will be a gift uninterrupted .
So , you should not entertain any doubt about those whom they worship : They only worship what their fathers had worshipped before them . We shall verily give them their meed without diminution .
Verily We gave to Moses the Book , but there was disagreement about it . Had the decree of your Lord ( delaying it ) not been issued the matter would have been settled between them .
Surely your Lord will reward everyone in accordance with his deeds .
He is certainly aware of all they do .
So , you and those who turned to God with you , should walk along the straight path as you have been commanded , and do not transgress , for He verily sees whatsoever you do .
Do not lean towards the wicked , or you will be caught in the flames of Hell , and have none to befriend you other than God , nor will you be given help .
Stand up for the service of prayer at the two ends of day and the first watch of night .
Remember that good deeds nullify the bad .
This is a reminder for those who are observant .
Be steadfast , for verily God does not let the reward of those who are upright and do good to go waste .
If only there had been men endued with virtue in the ages before you , who could preserve men from doing evil in the world , other than the few We saved from among them .
Those who were wicked followed that which made them dissolute , and became sinners .
Your Lord would not surely destroy unjustly human habitations so long as the people are righteous .
But if your Lord had pleased He could have made all human beings into one community of belief . But they would still have differed from one another ,
Except those on whom your Lord had mercy for which He has created them .
But fulfilled shall be the word of your Lord . &quot; I will fill up Hell with jinns and men . &quot;
The histories of apostles that We relate to you are ( meant ) to strengthen your heart .
Through them has the truth come to you , and guidance , and reminder to those who believe .
Say to the infidels . &quot; Act as best you can , we are acting too ;
And wait ( for what is to come ) , we are also waiting ( to see ) . &quot;
To God belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth , and all things will go back to Him .
So worship Him and put your trust in Him ; your Lord is not heedless of what you do .
ALIF LAM RA . These are the verses of the immaculate Book .
We have sent it down as a clear discourse that you may understand .
Through the revelation of this Qur &apos;an We narrate the best of histories of which you were unaware before .
When Joseph told his father : &quot; O my father , I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon bowing before me in homage , &quot;
He said : &quot; O son , do not narrate your dream to your brothers , or they will plot against you . Surely Satan is man &apos;s acknowledged foe .
Your Lord will choose you and teach you to interpret events , and confer His favours on you and the house of Jacob , as He had done in the case of two ancestors of yours , Abraham and Isaac , before you .
Indeed your Lord is all-knowing and all-wise . &quot;
In the story of Joseph and his brothers are lessons for those who inquire .
&quot; Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we , &quot; ( said his half brothers ) &quot; even though we are a well-knit band .
Our father is surely in the wrong .
Let us kill Joseph or cast him in some distant land so that we may get our father &apos;s exclusive affection ; then play innocent . &quot;
One of them said : &quot; If you must do so , then do not kill Joseph , but throw him into an unused well . Some passing caravan may rescue him . &quot;
( Then going to their father ) they said : &quot; O father , why don &apos;t you trust us with Joseph ? We are in fact his well-wishers .
Let him go out with us tomorrow that he may enjoy and play . We shall take care of him . &quot;
He said : &quot; I am afraid of sending him with you lest a wolf should devour him when you are unmindful . &quot;
They replied : &quot; If a wolf should devour him when we are there , a well-knit band , we shall certainly be treacherous . &quot;
So , when they took him out they planned to throw him into an unused well . We revealed to Joseph : &quot; You will tell them ( one day ) of this deed when they will not apprehend it . &quot;
At nightfall they came to their father weeping ,
And said : &quot; We went racing with one another and left Joseph to guard our things when a wolf devoured him . But you will not believe us even though we tell the truth . &quot;
They showed him the shirt with false blood on it .
( Their father ) said : &quot; It is not so ; you have made up the story .
Yet endurance is best .
I seek the help of God alone for what you impute . &quot;
A caravan happened to pass , and sent the water-carrier to bring water from the well .
He let down his bucket ( and pulled Joseph up with it ) .
&quot; What luck , &quot; said the man ; &quot; here is a boy ; &quot; and they hid him as an item of merchandise ; but what they did was known to God .
And they sold him as worthless for a few paltry dirham .
The Egyptian who bought him instructed his wife : &quot; House him honourably .
He may be of use to us . We may even adopt him as a son . &quot;
So , We firmly established Joseph in the land , and taught him the interpretation of dreams .
God dominated in his affairs , though most men do not know .
When he reached the prime of life We gave him wisdom and knowledge .
Thus We reward those who are good .
But she in whose house he resided wished to seduce him and , closing the doors , said : &quot; Come into me .
&quot; God forbid ! &quot; he said ; &quot; he is my master who has approved my stay .
Surely those who act wrongly do not prosper . &quot;
But the woman desired him , and he would have desired her but for the indication he received from his Lord .
This was so that We may avert both evil and lechery from him , for he was one of Our chosen devotees .
Both of them raced to the door , and she ( grabbed and ) rent his shirt from behind .
They met her lord outside the door . &quot; There is no other penalty for a man , &quot; said she , &quot; who wanted to outrage your wife but imprisonment or grievous punishment . &quot;
( Joseph ) said : &quot; It was she who wanted to seduce me . &quot;
And a witness from her family testified : &quot; If the shirt is torn from the front then the woman is speaking the truth , and he is a liar .
But if the shirt is torn from behind then she is a liar , and he speaks the truth . &quot;
When the husband saw the shirt torn at the back , he said : &quot; Surely this is a woman &apos;s ruse , and the wiles of women are great .
Ignore this affair , O Joseph ; and you , O woman , ask forgiveness for your sin , for you were surely errant . &quot;
In the city the women gossiped : &quot; The minister &apos;s wife longs after her page . He has captured her heart .
We think she is in clear error . &quot;
When she heard their slanderings , she sent for them and prepared a banquet , and gave each of them a knife ( for paring fruit ) , and called ( to Joseph ) : &quot; Come out before them . &quot;
When they saw him , the women were so wonderstruck they cut their hands , and exclaimed : &quot; O Lord preserve us !
He is no mortal but an honourable angel . &quot;
She said : &quot; This is the one you blamed me for .
I did desire his person , but he preserved himself from sin .
Yet in case he does not do my bidding he will be put into prison and disgraced . &quot;
( Joseph ) prayed : &quot; O Lord , dearer is prison than what they invite me to . Unless You turn their guiles away from me I shall succumb to their charms and thus become a pagan . &quot;
His Lord heard his prayer , and averted the women &apos;s wiles from him .
He verily hears and knows everything .
And yet in spite of having seen these clear proofs they found it proper to incarcerate him for a time .
Two other youths were imprisoned along with him .
Said one of them : &quot; I dreamt that I was pressing grapes ; &quot; and the other : &quot; I dreamt that I was carrying bread on my head , and the birds were pecking at it .
You tell us the meaning of this . You seem to be a righteous man . &quot;
( Joseph ) answered : &quot; I will give you its interpretation before the food you are served arrives .
This knowledge is one of the things my Lord has taught me .
I have given up the religion of those who do not believe in God and deny the life to come .
I follow the faith of my fathers , of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob .
We cannot associate anyone with God .
This is among God &apos;s favours to us and to all mankind ; but most men are not grateful .
( Tell me ) O fellow-prisoners , are a number of gods better , or one God omnipotent ?
( What ) you worship besides Him are nothing but names that you and your fathers have assigned , for which no sanction has been sent down by God .
Authority belongs to God alone .
He commands that you worship none but Him .
This is the right way ; but most men are ignorant .
O fellow-prisoners , one of you will serve wine to your master , the other will be crucified and the birds will peck at his brain .
Determined is the matter of your inquiry . &quot;
And ( Joseph ) asked the man he knew would be released : &quot; Remember me to your lord ; &quot; but Satan made him forget to mention this to his lord , and Joseph remained in prison for a number of years .
( One day ) the king said ( to his courtiers ) : &quot; I saw seven fat cows in a dream being devoured by seven lean ones , and seven ears of corn that were green and seven others that were seared .
O courtiers , tell me the significance of my dream , if you know how to interpret them . &quot;
&quot; They were only confused dreams , &quot; they said ; &quot; we do not know how to interpret them . &quot;
Then the servant , who of the two had been released , remembering ( Joseph ) , said : &quot; I will give you its interpretation ; let me go for it . &quot;
( And coming to the prison ) he said : &quot; O Joseph the truthful , tell us ( the meaning of ) seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones , and seven green ears of corn and seven seared , that I may go back to the people and tell them . &quot;
He said : &quot; Sow as usual for seven years , and after reaping leave the corn in the ears , except the little you need for food .
Then there will come seven years of hardship which will consume the grain you had laid up against them , except a little you may have stored away .
This will be followed by a year of rain , and people shall press ( the grapes ) . &quot;
The king said : &quot; Bring him to me .
So when the messenger came to Joseph , he said : &quot; Go back to your lord and ask him : &apos; How fare the women who had cut their hands ? &apos; My Lord is cognisant of their guile . &quot;
The king asked the women : &quot; What was the affair of seducing Joseph ? &quot;
&quot; God preserve us , &quot; they said ; &quot; we know no evil against him . &quot;
The wife of the minister said : &quot; The truth has now come out .
It was I who desired to seduce him , but he is indeed a man of virtue . &quot; --
( At this Joseph remarked : ) &quot; From this ( the Minister ) should know that I did not betray him in his absence , and that God does not surely let the wiles of those who betray ever succeed .
But I do not wish to absolve myself , for the soul is prone to evil , unless my Lord have mercy .
Indeed my Lord is forgiving and kind . &quot; --
When the king heard this he said : &quot; Bring him to me . I shall take him in my special service . &quot;
When he had talked to him , he said : &quot; Today you are established in a rank of trust with us . &quot;
&quot; Appoint me over the granaries of the land , &quot; ( he said ) ; &quot; I shall be a knowledgeable keeper . &quot;
Thus We gave Joseph authority in the land so that he lived wherever he liked .
We bestow Our favours on whomsoever We please , and do not allow the reward of those who are good to go waste .
And certainly the recompense of the life to come is better for those who believe and follow the right path .
The brothers of Joseph came ( to Egypt ) and visited him . He recognised them , though they did not recognise him .
When he had supplied their provisions , he said to them : &quot; Bring your ( half ) brother with you .
Have you not seen that I have given full measure , and that I am the best of hosts ?
But if you do not bring him with you , then I shall have no grain for you , nor should you come back to me . &quot;
They said : &quot; We shall request his father , and will certainly do that . &quot;
Then he ordered his servants : &quot; Put their money back in their packs : They may find it on reaching home , and perhaps come again . &quot;
When they returned to their father , they said : &quot; O father , a further measure has been denied us . So send our brother with us that he may bring more grain .
He replied : &quot; Should I trust you with him as I did his brother ?
But God is the best of guardians , and most merciful of all . &quot;
When they unpacked their goods they said : &quot; O father , what more can we ask ?
Look , even our money has been returned .
We shall go and bring a camel-load more of grain for our family , and take good care of our brother .
That will be an easy measure . &quot;
He said : &quot; I will never send him with you until you swear by God that you will bring him back to me , unless all of you are overtaken ( by misfortune ) . &quot;
When they had given their promise , he said : &quot; God is witness to our conversation . &quot;
( As they were leaving ) their father said to them : &quot; O my sons , do not seek one approach but employ different ways ( of attaining your object ) . If anything should befall you from God I shall not be able to avert it , for all authority belongs to God .
I have placed my trust in Him , and the trusting should rely on Him alone . &quot;
When they entered as their father had advised them , nothing could avail them against ( the will of ) God , yet it confirmed a premonition Jacob had , for verily he had knowledge as We had taught him , though most men do not know .
When they came to Joseph he made his brother his guest , and said : &quot; I am your brother .
So do not grieve for what they had done . &quot;
When he had given them their provisions he put his goblet in his brother &apos;s saddle-bag .
Then a crier announced : &quot; O men of the caravan , you are thieves . &quot;
They turned to them and asked : &quot; What is it you have lost ? &quot;
&quot; We cannot find the master &apos;s goblet . Whoever comes up with it will be given a camel-load of grain ; I vouch for it . &quot;
They said : &quot; We swear by God . You know we did not come to commit any crime in the land , nor are we thieves . &quot;
&quot; What should be the punishment , &quot; they were asked , &quot; in case you are liars ? &quot;
&quot; The punishment for that ( should be ) , &quot; they said , &quot; that he in whose luggage it is found should be held as punishment .
This is how we repay the wrong-doers . &quot;
So he searched their saddle-bags before his brother &apos;s , then produced the cup from his brother &apos;s bag .
That is how We planned an excuse for Joseph , for under the law of the king he could not detain his brother unless God so willed .
We raise the status of whom We please . Over every man of knowledge there is one more knowing .
Said the brothers : &quot; If he has stolen ( no wonder ) , his brother had stolen before . &quot;
But Joseph kept this secret and did not disclose it to them , and said ( to himself ) : &quot; You are worse in the degree of evil , for God knows better of what you allege . &quot;
They said : &quot; O Minister , he has an aged father , so keep one of us in his place . We see you are a virtuous man . &quot;
&quot; May God forgive us , &quot; he said , &quot; if we hold any one but him with whom we found our property , or else we would be unjust . &quot;
When they despaired of ( persuading ) him , they went aside to confer .
The oldest of them said : &quot; You know that your father has pledged you in the name of God , and you have been guilty of iniquity in the case of Joseph before .
I will not leave this place unless my father permits or God decides for me , for He is the best of all judges .
So , go to your father and tell him : &apos; O father , your son has committed a theft . We bear witness to only what we know ; we could not prevent the unknown .
Enquire from the people of that city , or ask the men of the caravan with whom we have come . We are verily speaking the truth . &apos; &quot;
&quot; No , &quot; said ( the father ) .
&quot; You have made up the story ; but patience is best ; God may bring them back to me . He is all-knowing and all-wise . &quot;
He turned away from them and cried : &quot; Alas for Joseph ! &quot;
And his eyes turned white with grief which he bore in silence .
&quot; By God , &quot; said they , &quot; you will never stop thinking of Joseph till you are consumed or perish . &quot;
He replied : &quot; I cry my plaint and grief to God , and know from God what you do not know .
O sons , go in search of Joseph and his brother , and do not despair of the mercy of God . Only they despair of God &apos;s mercy who do not believe . &quot;
When they returned to him , they said ( to Joseph ) : &quot; O Minister , calamity has befallen us and our people . We have brought but a meagre sum , but give us full measure as alms bestowed .
God surely rewards those who give alms . &quot;
, He said : &quot; Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance ? &quot;
They said : &quot; Surely you are not Joseph ! &quot;
&quot; I am Joseph , &quot; he said , &quot; and this is my brother .
God has been gracious to us ; for God does not verily deprive those who fear Him and are patient of the recompense of those who are good . &quot;
They said : &quot; By God , God has favoured you above us , for we have indeed been sinners . &quot;
&quot; There is no blame on you today , &quot; he said , &quot; May God forgive you .
He is the most merciful of all .
Take my shirt and put it on my father &apos;s face ; his eyesight will be restored ; and bring your entire family to me . &quot;
The caravan departed ( from Egypt ) and Jacob said ( at home ) : &quot; Say not that I am in my dotage , but I get the smell of Joseph . &quot;
They said : &quot; By God , you are still persisting in your old delusion . &quot;
Then , as the harbinger of happy news arrived and put the garment over his face his eyesight was restored .
He said : &quot; Did I not tell you ? I know from God what you do not know . &quot;
Said ( the sons ) : &quot; O our father , pray for us that our sins be forgiven , for we are really sinners . &quot;
&quot; I will ask my Lord to forgive you , &quot; he replied , &quot; for He is forgiving and kind . &quot;
When they went back to Joseph he gave his father and mother a place of honour , and said : &quot; Enter Egypt in peace by the will of God . &quot;
He seated his parents by his side on the throne ; and they fell down before him in homage .
&quot; O my father , &quot; said Joseph , &quot; this is the meaning of my earlier dream .
My Lord has made it come true .
He was gracious in getting me out of the prison , and bringing you out of the desert to me after the discord created by Satan between me and my brothers , for my Lord is gracious to whomsoever He please . He is indeed all-knowing and all-wise .
O my Lord , you have given me dominion and taught me the interpretation of dreams ; O Creator of the heavens and the earth , You alone are my saviour in this world and the world to come ; let me die submitting to You , and place me among the upright . &quot;
This is news of the unknown We reveal to you , for you were not present when Joseph &apos;s brothers agreed on their course of action , and devised their plot .
Many men will not believe howsoever you wish ,
Even though you ask no recompense ( for it ) .
It is only a warning for all mankind .
How many a sign there is in the heavens and the earth which most men pass by and ignore ,
Not only do they not believe in God , but also associate others with Him .
Do they really believe that an all-embracing punishment of God will not come upon them , or the Day of Doom overtake them suddenly while they remain unaware ?
Say : &quot; My way , and that of my followers , is to call you to God with full perception .
All glory to God , I am not an idolater . &quot;
All the apostles We had sent before you were men of those regions , to whom We sent Our revelations .
Have they not travelled on the earth and seen what befell the people before them ?
Surely the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear straying from the right path .
Do you not understand ?
When the apostles despaired and thought they were made false promises , Our help arrived , and We delivered whom We pleased ; but never will Our punishment be averted from the sinners .
Verily in their accounts is a lesson for men of wisdom .
This is not a fictitious tale , but a verification of earlier Books , and a clear exposition of everything , and a guidance and grace for those who believe .
ALIF LAM MIM RA .
These are the verses of the Scripture .
Whatsoever is sent down to you from your Lord is the truth ; but most men do not believe .
It is God who raised the skies without support , as you can see , then assumed His throne , and enthralled the sun and the moon ( so that ) each runs to a predetermined course . He disposes all affairs , distinctly explaining every sign that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord .
It is He who stretched the earth and placed upon it stabilisers and rivers ; and made two of a pair of every fruit ; ( and ) He covers up the day with the night .
In these are signs for those who reflect .
On the earth are tracts adjoining one another , and vineyards , fields of corn and date-palm trees , some forked , some with single trunks , yet all irrigated by the self-same water , though We make some more excellent than the others in fruit .
There are surely signs in them for those who understand .
If you are surprised , then astonishing is the speech ( of those who say : ) &quot; Having turned to dust shall we be raised as a new creation ? &quot;
They are the ones who deny their Lord , and they will have collars around their necks . They are the inmates of Hell , where they will abide for ever .
They want you to hasten the evil before the good , even when there have been examples of retribution before them .
Though certainly your Lord forgives human beings for their iniquities , your Lord is severe of retribution .
The unbelievers say : &quot; Why no miracle was sent down to him by his Lord ? &quot;
But you are only a bearer of warnings , and a guide for every nation .
God is cognisant of what every female carries in her womb , or what the wombs want or exceed ( of their disburdening time ) .
With Him all things are in determined measure .
He is the knower of the known and the unknown , the mighty and most high .
He who keeps his secret among you is the same to Him as he who speaks out publicly , and he who hides himself in the night and walks freely in the day .
His angels keep watch over him in succession ( night and day ) , in front and behind , by God &apos;s command .
Verily God does not change the state of a people till they change themselves .
When God intends misfortune for a people no one can avert it , and no saviour will they have apart from Him .
It is He who makes the lightning flash for fear and hope , and raises massive clouds .
The thunder sings His praises , and the angels too , for awe of Him .
He sends thunder-bolts and strikes whosoever He will with them : Even then it is God they contend about ! But mighty is He in ( His ) power .
To call on Him is true ( supplication ) . For those they invoke other than Him do not answer them at all , except like a man who stretches his hands towards the water that it reach his mouth , but it will never reach it .
Not more than error are the prayers of infidels .
Whosoever is in the heavens and on earth bows to God in submission with a will or perforce , as do their shadows in the morning and evening .
Ask them : &quot; Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth ? &quot;
( They will ) say : &quot; God . &quot;
Say : &quot; Then why do you take protectors besides Him who have no power over their own gain or loss ? &quot;
Say : &quot; Can a blind man and one who can see be equal ?
Or , darkness and light be the same ?
Or , have those they have appointed equal of God created , as He has created , so that the ( two ) creations look alike to them ? &quot;
Say : &quot; God is the creator of everything . He is One , the omnipotent . &quot;
He sends down water from the skies , which flows in channels according to their capacity , with the scum borne on the surface of the torrent , as rises the scum when metals are heated on the fire for making ornaments and household utensils .
This is how God determines truth and falsehood .
The scum disappears like the foam on the bank , and that which is useful to man remains on the earth .
That is how God sets forth precepts of wisdom .
For those who obey their Lord is excellence . For those who fail to obey , the reckoning will be hard , even if they possess and give as ransom all that there is on the earth , and as much more ; and Hell will be their abode : How wretched is its wide expanse !
Can a man who knows what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth , and one who cannot see , be the same ?
They alone take warning who are wise ,
Who fulfil their covenant with God and do not break their agreement ,
Who keep together what God has ordained held together , and fear their Lord and dread the hardship of the Reckoning ,
Who persevere in seeking the way of their Lord , who fulfil their devotional obligations , and spend of what We have given them , secretly or openly , who repel evil with good : For them is the recompense of Paradise :
Perpetual gardens which they will enter with those of their fathers , spouses and children who were virtuous and at peace , with angels coming in through every door
Saying : &quot; ( Welcome , ) peace on you , for you persevered . &quot; How excellent the recompense of Paradise !
As for those who break God &apos;s covenant after validating it , and sever relations which God ordained cohered , and spread corruption in the land , there is condemnation for them and an evil abode .
God increases or decreases the fortunes of whosoever He will , and they rejoice in the life of this world .
Yet the life of this world is nothing but a merchandise as compared to the life of the next .
The unbelievers say : &quot; How is it that no miracle was sent down to him by his Lord ? &quot;
Say : &quot; God leads whosoever He wills astray , and guides whoever turns to Him in repentance .
Those who believe and find peace in their hearts from the contemplation of God : Surely there is peace of heart in the contemplation of God ! &quot;
Those who believe and do the right , have happiness , and an excellent resting place .
That is how We have sent you to a people before whom many a people have come and gone , so that you may announce to them whatever We have revealed to you . But they do not believe in Ar-Rahman .
Tell them : &quot; He is my Lord . There is no other god but He .
In Him have I placed my trust , and to Him is my reversion . &quot;
Had there been a Qur &apos;an which could have made the mountains move , or the earth to cleave asunder , or the dead to speak , yet all authority belongs to God .
Have the believers not learnt that if God had so willed He could have guided all mankind ?
As for unbelievers , they will be visited by misfortune endlessly for what they have done ; or it would sit in their homes till the promised threat of God comes to pass .
Surely God does not go back on His promise .
Many an apostle have they mocked before you ; but I allowed the unbelievers respite , then I seized them .
How severe was My punishment then !
Who is it who stands ( watch ) over every soul for what it does ?
Yet they ascribe compeers to God .
Say : &quot; Then name them .
Or are you announcing to God what He does not know on the earth ?
Or is it only empty talk ?
In fact , the unbelievers &apos; plots are made to look attractive to them , so that they are held back from the right path .
Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way .
For them is punishment in this world ; and the punishment of the world to come is far more severe . They will have no one to save them from God .
The likeness of Paradise promised the pious and devout is ( of a garden ) with streams of rippling water , everlasting fruits and shade .
This is the recompense of those who keep away from evil ; but the recompense of those who deny the truth is Hell .
Those to whom We have given the Scriptures rejoice in what We have sent down to you ; but some of their factions reject some of it .
Tell them : &quot; I am commanded to worship only God , and not to associate compeers with Him .
To Him I call you , and to Him is the destination . &quot;
That is how We have sent down this ( Qur &apos;an ) as a code of clear judgement .
But if you follow their caprices , now that you have been given knowledge , you will have no friend or protector against God .
We sent many apostles before you , and bestowed on them wives and children , but it was not for any apostle to come up with a miracle unless by the leave of God .
For every age there is a law .
God abrogates or confirms whatsoever He will , for He has with Him the Book of Books .
Whether We allow you to see ( the punishment ) We have promised them , or end your life before ( its execution ) , it is certainly for you to convey the message ; the reckoning is for Us to do .
Do they not see Us advancing from all sides into their land and reducing its frontiers ?
It is for God to judge ; and there is none to reverse His judgement .
He is swift at reckoning .
Surely those who had gone before them had also plotted ; but God &apos;s is all the planning , for He has knowledge of what each does .
The unbelievers will soon learn for whom is the guerdon of Paradise .
Yet those who are disbelievers say : &quot; You are not the apostle sent ( by God ) . &quot;
Tell them : &quot; God is sufficient as witness between me and you , and he who has knowledge of the Book . &quot;
ALIF LAM RA . A Book We have sent down to you that you may lead men out of darkness into light , by their Lord &apos;s command , to the path of the mighty , the worthy of praise .
God , to whom belongs all there is in the heavens and the earth .
Woe to the unbelievers for the terrible punishment ( that awaits ) .
Those who hold the life of this world dearer than that of the next , who obstruct the path of God and seek obliquity in it , have wandered far into error .
We never sent a messenger who did not speak the tongue of his people , that he may explain to them distinctly .
God leads whosoever He wills astray , and shows whoever He wills the way : He is all-mighty and all-wise .
Remember when We sent Moses with Our signs ( We said ) : &quot; Bring your people out of darkness into light , and remind them of the visitations of God .
Indeed there are signs in this for every steadfast , thankful soul &quot;
So Moses said to his people : &quot; Remember the favours of God when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh who afflicted you with oppression , slaying your sons but keeping alive your women , which was a great trial from your Lord . &quot;
Remember , your Lord proclaimed : &quot; I shall give you more if you are grateful ; but if you are thankless then surely My punishment is very great . &quot;
And Moses said : &quot; What if you and all the people of the world deny , God is unconcerned and worthy of praise . &quot;
Has not the news of those before you , the people of Noah and &apos; Ad and Thamud , and those who came after them , come to you ?
None knows ( about ) them except God .
Their apostles came to them with clear proofs , but they tried to silence them and said : &quot; We do not believe in what you have been sent with , and we are in doubt of what you call us to , about which we are in disquiet . &apos; 
Said their apostles : &quot; Can there be doubt about God , the originator of the heavens and the earth ?
He calls you to forgive some of your sins , and give you respite for a time ordained . &quot;
They said : &quot; You are only men like us , and yet you wish to turn us away from what our fathers worshipped .
Bring to us then a clear proof . &quot;
Their apostles said to them : &quot; Indeed we are men like you , but God bestows His favours on whomsoever He wills among His creatures .
It is not in our power to bring a miracle for you without the leave of God .
The believers should only place their trust in God .
And why should we not repose our trust in God when He has shown us our paths of duty to Him ?
We shall bear with fortitude the hardships you inflict upon us . The trusting place their trust in God . &quot;
The unbelievers said to their apostles : &quot; We shall drive you out of our land , or else you come back to our fold . &quot;
Their Lord then communicated to them : &quot; We shall annihilate these wicked people ,
And establish you in their place .
This is for him who fears My station , and dreads My commination . &quot;
Then ( the apostles ) asked of God &apos;s assistance , and every arrogant tyrant was frustrated :
Before him is Hell , and he will get putrid liquid to drink .
He will sip it , yet will not be able to gulp it down .
Death will crowd in upon him from every side , but die he will not .
A terrible torment trails him .
Like ashes are the deeds of those who deny their Lord , which the wind blows away on a windy day .
They shall have no power over what they earned .
This is the farthest limit of going astray .
Do you not see that God has created the heavens and the earth with ultimate reason ?
If He so wills He could take you away from the earth and raise a new creation ( in your place ) .
This is well within the power of God .
When they will all appear before God together , the weak will say to those who were arrogant : &quot; We were your followers , so can you now save us a little from God &apos;s punishment ? &quot;
They will say : &quot; If we had been guided by God we would surely have shown you the way .
To lament or endure is all the same to us now . No getting away is there for us . &quot;
When the reckoning is over Satan will say : &quot; The promise that was made to you by God was indeed a true promise ; but I went back on the promise I had made , for I had no power over you except to call you ; and you responded to my call .
So blame me not , but blame yourselves .
Neither can I help you nor can you give me help .
I disavow your having associated me earlier ( with God ) .
The punishment for those who are wicked is painful indeed . &quot;
Those who believed and did the right , will be admitted to gardens with rivers flowing by , where they will abide by the leave of their Lord , with &apos; Peace &apos; as their salutation .
Do you not see how God compares a noble act to a healthy tree whose roots are firm and branches in the sky , which yields
By the leave of its Lord its fruit in all seasons , God presents words of wisdom to men that they might reflect .
An evil act is like a rotten tree torn out of the earth with no ( base or ) firmness .
With immutuble words God makes the faithful dauntless in the life of the world and the life to come , but leads the unjust into error , for God does as He pleases .
Have you not looked at those who repaid God &apos;s favours with ingratitude ; who pulled their people down to ruin ,
Hell , where they will roast in the fire ? And what an evil repository !
They have appointed equals of God to mislead people from His path .
Tell them : &quot; Enjoy yourselves ( so long as you may ) . In the end you have to go to Hell . &quot;
Tell those of My creatures who believe : &quot; Observe your devotional obligations and give of what We have given you in charity , secretly or openly , before the Day arrives when there will be no buying or selling or befriending . &quot;
It is God who created the heavens and the earth , and sent down rain from the sky producing fruits for your food thereby , and made you master of the ships that ply in the oceans by His command , subjected the rivers to your control ,
And subjugated the sun and moon for you so that they perform their tasks diligently ; and subdued the night and day for your service .
He gave you whatsoever you asked . If you try to count the favours of God you will not be able to calculate .
Man is most unjust indeed , full of ingratitude .
Remember when Abraham prayed : &quot; O Lord , make this a city of peace , and preserve me and my progeny from worshipping idols :
Many a man have they led astray , O Lord .
So he who follows me is truly of me ; but as for him who disobeys me , surely You are forgiving and kind .
I have settled some of my children , O Lord , in a barren valley near Your sacred House , so that , O our Lord , they may be constant in devotion .
So put in the hearts of men some kindness for them , and provide fruits for them : They may haply be grateful .
O Lord , You have knowledge of what we hide and what we reveal , for nothing on the earth or in the skies is hidden from God .
All praise be to God who bestowed on me Ishmael and Isaac in old age .
Verily my Lord listens to prayer .
Grant , O Lord , that I and my offspring may remain constant in devotion .
Grant , O Lord , my supplication .
O Lord , forgive me , my parents and the faithful on the Day the reckoning is done . &quot;
Think not God is oblivious of the deeds of the wicked .
He has only allowed them respite till the Day on which all eyes would stare aghast ,
( And ) they would hasten forward , heads lifted upwards , gazes fixed , and emptied out their hearts .
Warn the people of that Day when the punishment would be inflicted upon them .
Then will the wicked say : &quot; O our Lord , give us respite a while more .
We shall heed Your call and follow the apostles . &quot; ( But they will be told , ) : &quot; Are you not those who used to swear : &apos; There is no reverse for us ? &apos;
Yet you dwelt in the dwellings of those who had exceeded themselves , and it was evident to you how We had dealt with them ; and We held out examples before you . &quot;
Still they are plotting their plots , but evident are their plots to God , even though they are so adroit as to make the mountains move .
Think not that God would go back on His promise ( made ) to the apostles . Indeed God is mighty , the Lord of retribution .
The day when the earth will he replaced by some other than the earth , as will be the skies , and every one will appear before God the one and omnipotent ,
You will see the wicked on that day bound together in chains .
Of molten pitch shall be their garments , their faces covered with flames ,
That God may reward each soul for its deeds .
Indeed God is swift at reckoning !
This is a message for mankind that they may take a warning from it , and may know that He is the one and only God , and that men of wisdom may reflect .
ALIF LAM RA . These are the verses of the Book and the perspicuous oration .
The unbelievers would haply like to wish that they had submitted ( and become Muslim ) .
Leave them to feast and revel , beguiled by hope ; they will come to know soon .
Not one habitation have We destroyed but at the time determined for it .
No people can hasten or delay the term already fixed for them .
And yet they say : &quot; You , to whom this Exposition has been sent are surely possessed of the Devil .
If you are a man of truth , why can &apos;t you bring the angels to us ? &quot;
But then We never send the angels down save with the purpose ( of enforcing their doom ) , after which they will not be given more respite .
We have sent down this Exposition , and We will guard it .
We had also sent apostles to people of earlier persuasions .
But never once an apostle came to them at whom they did not scoff .
We place in the hearts of sinners ( disbelief ) .
So , they will not believe in it : The example of former people is there .
Even if We open a door in the heavens and they ascend through it in broad daylight ,
They will say all the same : &quot; Our eyes were dazed ( and clouded over ) . We were a people ensorcelled . &quot;
We have placed the signs of the Zodiac in the sky , and decked it out for those who can see ;
And We have preserved it from every accursed devil ,
Except the ones who listen on the sly , yet they are chased away by a shooting flame .
We stretched the earth and placed upon it firm stabilisers , and made all things grow upon it balanced evenly .
We have provided on it sustenance for you , and for those you cannot provide .
Of all things there are We have the stores , and send them down in determined measure .
We send rain-impregnated winds , and water from the sky which you drink , but you are not the keepers of its store .
It is We who give life and We who give death , and We are the One who will abide .
We surely know those of you who go forward and those of you who lag behind .
Your Lord will surely gather them together : Certainly He is all-wise and all-knowing .
Man We fashioned from fermented clay dried tingling hard ,
As We fashioned jinns before from intense radiated heat .
But when your Lord said to the angels : &quot; I am verily going to create a human being from fermented clay dried tingling hard ;
And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My spirit , bow before him in homage ; &quot;
The angels bowed in homage in a body
Except Iblis . He refused to bow with the adorers .
&quot; How is it , O Iblis , &quot; said ( the Lord ) , &quot; you did not join those who bowed in homage ? &quot;
&quot; How could I bow , &quot; said he , &quot; before a mortal whom You created from fermented clay dried tingling hard ? &quot;
&quot; Go hence , execrable , &quot; ( said the Lord ) , &quot; from this place ,
Condemned till the day of Doom ! &quot;
&quot; O my Lord , &quot; said he , &quot; give me respite till the day the dead are raised . &quot;
&quot; You are among the reprieved , &quot; ( said the Lord ) ,
&quot; Till the predetermined time . &quot;
&quot; O my Lord , &quot; he said , &quot; since You have led me into error I &apos;ll beguile them with the pleasures of the world and lead them astray ,
Except the chosen ones among Your creatures . &quot;
( To which God ) said : &quot; This way is right by Me .
No power shall you have over ( all ) My creatures except those who fall into error and follow you ,
For whom the ordained place is surely Hell ,
Which has several gates , and each gate is marked for every section of them . &quot;
Verily those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path shall be in the midst of gardens and springs of water .
&quot; Enter in peace and tranquility , &quot; ( they will be told ) .
We shall cast out any grudge they may have in their hearts . ( There ) they will sit on couches face to face like brothers together .
No weariness will come upon them , nor will they be sent away from there .
Announce to My creatures that I am indeed forgiving and kind ,
But My punishment is surely a painful one .
Inform them about the matter of Abraham &apos;s guests .
When they came to him and said : &quot; Peace , &quot; he answered : &quot; Truly we are afraid of you . &quot;
&quot; Have no fear , &quot; they said . &quot; We bring you news of a son full of wisdom . &quot;
&quot; You bring me the good news now , &quot; he said , &quot; when old age has come upon me .
What good news are you giving me then ? &quot;
&quot; We have given you the happy tidings of a truth , &quot; they replied . &quot; So do not be one of those who despair . &quot;
&quot; Who would despair of the mercy of his Lord , &quot; he answered , &quot; but those who go astray . &quot;
And asked them : &quot; What matter , O angels , brings you here ? &quot;
&quot; We have been sent , &quot; they said , &quot; to ( punish ) a sinful people ,
&quot; Except the family of Lot whom we shall save
&quot; Other than his wife who , it is decreed , will remain with those who will stay behind . &quot;
When the messengers came to the family of Lot ,
He said : &quot; You are people I do not know . &quot;
&quot; We have come to you with news , &quot; they said , &quot; of what your people doubt ;
&quot; Yet we bring to you the truth , and we are truthful .
&quot; So leave with your family late in the night , yourself remaining in the rear , and let none turn back to look , and go where you will be commanded . &quot;
We issued this command to him , for they were going to be destroyed in the morning .
Then came the people of the city , exulting at the news .
Said Lot : &quot; These are my guests ; do not put me to shame ,
&quot; And do not disgrace me . Have some fear of God . &quot;
&quot; Did we not restrain you , &quot; they said , &quot; from ( entertaining ) creatures from the outside world ? &quot;
&quot; Here are my daughters , &quot; said Lot , &quot; if you are so active . &quot;
Verily by your life they were utterly confused in their ( lustful ) drunkenness .
So they were seized by the mighty blast at break of day ;
And We turned the city upside down , and rained on them stones of hardened lava .
Herein are really signs for those who discern .
This ( city ) lies on a road that still survives .
Indeed there is a portent in this for those who believe .
The dwellers of the Wood ( near Midian ) were also wicked .
So We punished them too .
They are both situated by the highway , clearly visible .
The people of Al-Hijr denied Our apostles ;
And though We had given them Our signs they turned away from them .
They used to hew dwellings in the mountains to live in security .
But they were seized by the mighty blast towards the morning ;
And all that they had done ( for security ) availed them nothing .
We have not created but with reason the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them . The Hour ( of the great change ) is certain to come .
So turn away ( from them ) with a grace .
Surely your Lord is the Creator and knows ( everything ) .
We have indeed given you the seven oft-repeated ( examples ) , and the majestic Qur &apos;an .
So covet not things We have bestowed on a portion of them to enjoy , and do not grieve for them , and protect those who believe ;
And say : &quot; I am a distinct warner , &quot;
Like ( those ) We had sent to those schismatics who slandered their Books
And severed their Scripture into fragments .
By your Lord We shall question them one and all
About their deeds .
So declare to them what We have enjoined , and turn away from idolaters .
We are surely sufficient to deal with those who scoff at you ,
Who place other gods besides God . They will come to know soon .
We are well aware that you are disheartened by what they say .
But you should glorify your Lord with praises , and be among those who bow in submission ;
And go on worshipping your Lord till the certainty ( of death ) comes upon you .
THE DECREE of GOD will surely come ; so do not try to hasten it : Too glorious and high is He for what they associate with Him .
He sends the angels with revelation by His command , to any of His creatures as He please , ( saying ) : &quot; Warn that there is no god but I , so fear Me . &quot;
He created the heavens and the earth with reason .
Too glorious and high is He for what they associate with Him .
Man He created from a drop of semen ; and still he becomes an open contender .
He created the cattle from whom you get warm clothing and ( other ) advantages , and some you eat .
There is life and cheer for you as you drive them home in the evening , and lead them out in the morning to graze .
They carry your burdens to lands so distant you could not have reached without much hardship .
Indeed your Lord is compassionate and kind .
He created horses , mules and donkeys for riding and for splendour .
He created other things too which you do not know .
To God leads the right path , though some deviate .
If He willed He could guide you all to the right way .
It is He who sends down water from the sky of which you drink , and which nourishes the plants you feed your cattle ,
With which He makes crops grow , and olives , dates and grapes and fruits of every kind for you . In this is a sign for those who think .
He harnessed the day and night for you , as also the sun , the moon and the stars , by His command .
In this are signs for men who understand .
And other things of different shades has He produced on the earth for you .
In this are signs for those who reflect .
It is He who has subdued the sea that you may eat fresh meat from it , and obtain ornaments to wear .
You see the ships plough through it that you may seek of His bounties and , perhaps , be grateful .
He placed stablisers in the earth so that while it revolves you live undisturbed , and rivers and tracks so that you may find your way ;
As well as many other signs , as by the stars ( you ) find direction .
So , could one who creates be like one who cannot ?
Will you not then contemplate ?
If you count the favours of God you will not be able to calculate .
Assuredly God is forgiving and kind .
God knows what you hide and disclose .
, As for those they call besides God , they cannot create a thing , and have themselves been created .
Dead , without life they are , and do not know when they will be raised .
Your God is one God .
But the hearts of those who believe not in the life to come are filled with denial , and they are puffed up with pride .
Surely God knows what they hide and what they disclose .
He certainly does not love the proud .
For when they are asked : &quot; What has your Lord sent down ? &quot; they say : &quot; Tales of long ago . &quot;
On the Day of Resurrection they will carry their own burden and some of the load of those they have led astray without any knowledge .
Oh , how evil a burden they will carry !
Those who have gone before them had also conspired ; then God uprooted their structure from its foundation ; the roof fell over them from above , and punishment came upon them from somewhere they did not suspect .
On the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and ask : &quot; Where are My compeers for whom you contended ? &quot;
Those endowed with knowledge will say : &quot; Shame and evil surely are for unbelievers today . &quot;
They whose souls are drawn out by the angels while they are sinning , shall offer submission : &quot; We did no evil . &quot;
But God knows well what you did .
So enter the gates of Hell , and dwell there for ever .
How dreadful a dwelling for the haughty !
When those who took heed for themselves would be asked : &quot; What did your Lord send down ? &quot; They will answer : &quot; The best . &quot;
For those who do good there is good in the world , but certainly the abode of the next is better .
How excellent the home of the virtuous !
They will enter perennial gardens with streams of water and all they wish .
Thus will the pious and devout be rewarded .
When the angels receive the souls of those who are blameless they will say : &quot; Peace on you .
Enter Paradise as recompense for what you did . &quot;
What ! Do the ( unbelievers ) expect that the angels should descend , or the sentence of your Lord come to pass ?
So had the people done before them ; yet God did not wrong them , they wronged themselves .
The evil they perpetrated overtook them , and what they mocked has turned upon them .
The idolaters say : &quot; If God had willed we would not have worshipped anything apart from Him , nor would our fathers have done , nor would we have forbidden any thing without His ( leave ) . &quot;
So had the people done before them .
Therefore it is binding on the prophets to convey the message in clearest terms .
To every community We have sent an apostle . ( saying : ) &quot; Worship God , and keep away from all other deities . &quot;
Thus some of them were guided by God , and ruin was justified on some .
Travel over the earth and see what befell those who accused ( the apostles ) of lies .
Even if you are eager to guide them , God does not surely guide those who have gone astray : They will have no one to help them .
They swear emphatically in the name of God that God will not raise the dead .
On the contrary , it is a promise incumbent on Him , though most men do not understand ,
For ( they fear ) He might make what they differed about plain to them , and that the infidels may realise that they were liars .
Yet when We will a thing We have only to say : &quot; Be &quot; , and it is .
Those who left their homes in the cause of God after having been oppressed , will be given by Us a better place in the world , and if they knew , the guerdon of the next would be greater
( For ) those who persevere and place their trust in their Lord .
We sent before you none ( as apostles ) but men , to whom We sent revelations . In case you are unaware , enquire of those who are keepers of the Oracles of God .
We had Sent them with miracles and Books ; and We have sent to you this Reminder so that you may explain distinctly to men what was sent down to them : They may haply reflect .
Have the plotters of mischief become unafraid that God will not split the earth to swallow them , or that punishment will not fall upon them from somewhere they do not ( even ) suspect ?
Or that He will not seize them as they move about , and they will not be able to elude ( His grasp ) ;
Or He may seize them by diminishing their portion .
Yet your Lord is compassionate and kind .
Do they not see the shadows of all things God has created incline to the right and the left , bowing in obeisance to God ?
All things that move on the earth and in the heavens , and the angels , bow in homage to God , and do not behave with pride .
They have fear of God for His power over them , and act as commanded .
God says : &quot; Do not take to two gods , for there is only one God .
So fear Me . &quot;
Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him , and His the judgement for ever .
So will you fear any other than God ?
Whatsoever the blessings you enjoy are surely from God , and when in trouble you turn to Him in supplication .
Yet when He has delivered you from affliction , some of you ascribe companions to your Lord
So as to deny what We have bestowed on them .
Well , enjoy yourselves , you will come to know soon .
They set aside a portion of the food We have given them for those they do not know .
By God , you will surely have to answer for all you contrive !
They attribute daughters to God , the glorious , but for themselves whatsoever they please .
Yet when news of the birth of a daughter reaches one of them , his face is darkened , and he is overwhelmed with silent grief ,
And hides from people for shame at the news , ( at a loss ) whether he should keep her with shame , or bury her in the ground .
How bad is the judgement that they make !
The semblance of those who believe not in the life to come is that of the meanest ; but the semblance of God is the most sublime , for He is all-mighty and all-wise .
If God were to punish men for their inequity He would not leave a single moving thing on earth . Yet He gives them latitude for a time ordained .
Yet they attribute to God what they find detestable ; and their tongues assert the lie that for them is only good .
On the contrary , there is Fire for them , and they will be thrown into it .
By God , We sent apostles to many a people before you , but Satan made their acts seem attractive to them , and he is their friend this day , and a painful torment awaits them .
We have sent down this Book to you that you may explain to them what it is that they are differing about , and as guidance and a grace for those who believe .
God sends down water from the skies and quickens the dead earth to a new birth .
Here is a sign for those who listen .
And surely in cattle there is a lesson for you : We give you a drink from the extract of food in their bellies and blood-purest milk so delicious to drink ;
And in fruits of the date-palm and the vine , from which you obtain inebriating drinks and excellent food .
In this indeed are signs for those who understand .
Your Lord predisposed the bees to make their hives in mountains , trees and trellices ,
And suck from all fruits and flit about the unrestricted paths of their Lord .
A drink of various hues comes out of their bellies which contains medicine for men .
In this is a sign for those who reflect .
It is God who creates you , then makes you die ; and some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they had known before . God is indeed all-knowing and all-powerful .
God has favoured some of you over others in the means of subsistence .
But those who have been favoured with more do not give of their means to their dependents so that they may become equal with them .
Do they then deny God &apos;s beneficence ?
God has provided mates for you of your own kind , and has bestowed on you sons and daughters from your mates , and has given you good things for food .
Will they even then believe in the false and deny God &apos;s grace ?
Yet they worship those apart from God who cannot provide for them any sustenance from the heavens or the earth , nor will they have power to do so .
So do not invent similitudes for God .
Indeed God knows , and you do not know .
God presents the example of a man who is a hired servant with no power over anything , and another on whom We have bestowed a handsome fortune , who spends from it in private and in public : Can they be equal ?
Praised be God !
But most men do not understand .
God presents another example of two men , one dumb and unable to do a thing and is a burden on his master . Wherever he is sent he returns without any good ( result ) .
To God belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth , and the Hour of Doom is a matter of the winking of an eye , even less , for God has certainly power over all things .
God produced you from your mothers &apos; wombs knowing nothing , but gave you ears and eyes and hearts so that you may be grateful .
Do you not see the birds held high between the heavens and the earth ?
Nothing holds them ( aloft ) but God .
There are verily signs in this for those who believe .
God has given you homes to live in , and tents ( made ) from the hides of cattle convenient for days of travelling and halting ; and from their wool and fur and hair you make domestic articles and goods that last a certain time .
God has given you of things created , shade , and places of shelter in the mountains , and clothes for protection against the heat , and coats ( of mail ) for defence during war .
He thus bestows His favours on you so that you may be grateful to Him .
If they still turn away , your duty is to warn them in clear terms .
They do know the favours of God , and yet they deny them , for most of them are not grateful .
The day We shall call a witness from every people , the unbelievers will not be allowed to make excuses .
And when the wicked shall face the torment it will not be decreased , nor will they be reprieved .
When the idolaters see their partners they will call out : &quot; O our Lord , these are the partners we invoked instead of You ; &quot; but they will retort : &quot; You are liars . &quot;
They will offer submission to God that Day , and the lies they fabricated will not be of the least avail .
For those who deny the truth and obstruct ( others ) from the way of God , We shall add torment to torment as they were perpetrating corruption .
Remind them of the Day when We shall call from every people a witness against them , and make you a witness over them , for We have revealed to you the Book as an exposition of everything , and as guidance and grace and happy tidings for those who submit .
Verily God has enjoined justice , the doing of good , and the giving of gifts to your relatives ; and forbidden indecency , impropriety and oppression .
He warns you so that you may remember .
Fulfil your covenant with God , having made the covenant , and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them , as you have made God a witness over you .
Indeed God knows what you do .
And do not be like her who untwists her yarn having spun it into durable thread .
Do not use your oaths deceitfully because one party has ascendency over you .
God surely tries you in this way : He will make it clear to you on the Day of Resurrection what you were differing about .
If God had pleased He would surely have made you a single community of belief ; but He leads whosoever He wills astray , and guides whosoever He please . But you will surely be questioned about what you used to do .
So do not make your oaths a means of deceiving one another , lest your foot should slip after having found its hold , and you taste of evil for having hindered ( others ) from the way of God , and suffer a grievous punishment .
And do not trade God &apos;s covenant for a paltry price .
Remember , what is with God is better for you , if only you knew !
For what you possess will pass , but what is with God will abide .
We shall certainly award those who persevere a recompense in keeping with their deeds .
We shall invest whosoever works for good , whether man or woman , with a pleasant life , and reward them in accordance with the best of what they have done .
So , when you recite the Qur &apos;an seek refuge in God from Satan the execrable .
He does not have power over those who believe and place their trust in their Lord .
His power is only over those who take him as their patron , and those who ascribe equals ( to God ) .
When We replace a message with another -- and God knows best what He reveals -- they say : &quot; You have made it up ; &quot; yet most of them do not know .
You say : &quot; It has been sent by divine grace from your Lord with truth to strengthen those who believe , and as guidance and good news for those who have submitted ( to God ) . &quot;
Yet We know what they say : &quot; It is only a man who instructs him . &quot;
The speech of the man they imply is obscure while this is clear Arabic .
Those who do not believe in the words of God are verily not guided by God . For them is severe punishment .
They alone invent lies who do not believe in the words of God , and they are liars .
Whosoever denies having once believed -- unless he is forced to do so while his heart enjoys the peace of faith -- and opens his mind to disbelief will suffer the wrath of God . Their punishment will be great ,
For they loved the life of this world more than the life to come ; and God does not guide those who do not believe .
They are the ones whose hearts and ears and eyes have been sealed by God ; and these are the heedless .
They will surely be losers in the life to come ,
But ( to ) those who were victimised and left their homes and then fought and endured patiently , your Lord will surely be forgiving and kind .
On the day when every soul will come pleading for itself , and every soul will be recompensed for what it had done , no one will be wronged .
God presents the example of a town which enjoyed peace and security , its provisions coming from everywhere in abundance , but it denied the favours of God ; so God acquainted it with intimate hunger and fear ( as punishment ) for what they had done .
An apostle came to them who was one of them , but they called him a liar . Then they were seized by torment for they were sinners .
Eat the good and lawful of things that God has given you , and be grateful for the bounty of God , if you really worship Him .
He has forbidden carrion and blood and the flesh of the swine , and what has been killed in the name of any other but God ; but if one is driven by necessity ( to eat it ) without craving or reverting to it , then God is forgiving and kind .
Do not utter the lies your tongues make up : &quot; This is lawful , and this is forbidden , &quot; in order to impute lies to God ; for they who impute lies to God will not find fulfilment .
For them there is some enjoyment , but the punishment is painful .
We have already told you what We have forbidden the Jews .
We did not wrong them , they wronged themselves .
To those who do wrong out of ignorance , then repent and correct themselves , your Lord is indeed forgiving and kind .
Abraham was certainly a model of faith , obedient to God and upright , and not one of idolaters ,
Grateful to Him for His favours ; so He chose him and guided him to the path that is straight ,
And gave him what is good in the world , and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous and the good .
So We commanded you to follow the way of Abraham the upright who was not of idolaters .
As for the Sabbath , it was imposed on those who had differed about it ; and your Lord will tell them on the Day of Resurrection what it was they had differed about .
Call them to the path of your Lord with wisdom and words of good advice ; and reason with them in the best way possible . Your Lord surely knows who strays from His path , and He knows those who are guided the right way .
If you have to retaliate , do so to the extent you have been injured ; but if you forbear it is best for those who bear with fortitude .
Endure with patience , for your endurance is not without the help of God .
Do not grieve for them , and do not be distressed by their plots .
God is verily with those who are pious and devout , and those who are doers of good .
GLORY TO HIM who took His votary to a wide and open land from the Sacred Mosque ( at Makkah ) to the distant Mosque whose precincts We have blessed , that We may show him some of Our signs .
Verily He is all-hearing and all-seeing .
We gave Moses the Book , and made it a guidance for the children of Israel that they should not take another protector apart from Me .
O you , the offspring of those We bore ( in the ark ) with Noah , he was indeed a grateful votary .
We announced to the children of Israel in the Book : &quot; You will surely create disorder twice in the land , and become exceedingly arrogant . &quot;
So , when the time of the first prediction came , We sent against you Our creatures full of martial might , who ransacked your cities ; and the prediction was fulfilled .
Then We gave you a chance against them , and strengthened you with wealth and children , and increased your numbers ( and said ) :
&quot; If you do good , you will do so for your own good ; if you do ill , you will do it for your own loss . &quot;
So , when the time of the second prediction comes , ( We shall rouse another people ) to shame you , and enter the Temple as they had done the first time , and to destroy what they conquered utterly .
But if you repeat it , We shall do the same . We have constituted Hell as prison for unbelievers .
Verily this Qur &apos;an directs you to the path that is straight , and gives happy tidings to those who believe and do the right : For them is a great reward .
As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter , We have prepared a painful punishment .
Man prays for evil as he prays for good , for man is hasty .
We have created night and day as two signs , then We efface the sign of the night , and make the sign of the day resplendent that you may seek the bounty of your Lord , and know the computation of years and numbers .
We have expounded most distinctly everything .
Round each man &apos;s neck We have hung his ledger of deeds , and on the Day of Resurrection will present it as a book spread out ( and say ) :
&quot; Read your ledger ; this day you are sufficient to take your own account .
&quot; He who finds the right path does so for himself ; and he who goes astray does so to his own loss ; and no one who carries a burden bears another &apos;s load .
We never punish till We have sent a messenger .
&quot; And when We destroy a human habitation We send Our command to ( warn ) its people living a life of ease ; and when they disobey , the sentence against them is justified , and We destroy them utterly .
&quot; How many generations have We laid low after Noah , for your Lord knows and notices well enough the sins of His creatures .
&quot; Whosoever desires what hastes away , We hasten to give him ( in this life ) as much as We please to whosoever We will ; but afterwards there is Hell for him in which he will burn , disgraced and ostracised .
&quot; But he who desires the Hereafter , and strives for it with a will , and is a believer , will be favoured for his endeavour .
&quot; We bestow from the gifts of your Lord on these and on those , for the gifts of your Lord are not restricted .
&quot; See , how We favour one over the other ; and in life to come are higher ranks and favours greater still .
&quot; Do not set up another god with God , or you will remain disgraced and destitute .
&quot; So your Lord has decreed : Do not worship anyone but Him , and be good to your parents .
If one or both of them grow old in your presence , do not say fie to them , nor reprove them , but say gentle words to them
&quot; And look after them with kindness and love , and say : &quot; O Lord , have mercy on them as they nourished me when I was small . &quot;
Your Lord knows what is in your heart . If you are righteous , then He is indeed forgiving to those who turn ( to Him ) in repentance .
So give to your relatives what is their due , and to those who are needy , and the wayfarers ; and do not dissipate ( your wealth ) extravagantly .
Those who dissipate ( their wealth ) are the brethren of the devils , and the Devil was ungrateful to his Lord .
If you neglect ( your parents ) while seeking the bounty of your Lord , of which you are hopeful , speak to them softly .
Do not be niggardly , nor extravagant that you may later feel reprehensive and constrained .
Certainly your Lord provides with open hands whosoever He will , but according to capacity , for He knows and watches His creatures .
Do not abandon your children out of fear of poverty . We will provide for them and for you .
Killing them is certainly a great wrong .
And do not go near fornication , as it is immoral and an evil way .
And do not take a life , which God has forbidden , except in a just cause .
We have given the right ( of redress ) to the heir of the person who is killed , but he should not exceed the limits ( of justice ) by slaying ( the killer ) , for he will be judged ( by the same law ) .
And do not touch the property of the orphans except for bettering it , until they come of age ; and fulfil the promise made : You will surely be questioned about the promise .
Give full measure when you are measuring , and weigh on a balanced scale . This is better , and excellent its consequence .
Do not follow that of which you have no knowledge .
Verily the ear , the eye , the heart , each will be questioned .
And do not strut about the land with insolence : Surely you cannot cleave the earth , nor attain the height of mountains in stature .
All these are evil and odious to your Lord .
This is some of the wisdom your Lord has revealed to you .
So do not take another god apart from God , or you will be cast into Hell , reproved , ostracised .
Has God chosen to give you sons , and taken for Himself daughters from among the angels ?
You utter grievous things indeed !
We have explained ( the truth ) in various ways in this Qur &apos;an , that they may be warned ; but it only increased their refractoriness .
Say : &quot; Had there been other gods with Him , as they assert , they would surely have sought a way ( of opposition ) against the Lord of the Throne . &quot;
Too glorious and high is He , too exalted for what they say !
The seven skies , the earth , and all that lies within them , sing hallelujas to Him . There is nothing that does not chant His praises , but you do not understand their hymns of praise .
He is verily clement and forgiving .
When you recite the Qur &apos;an , We place a hidden veil between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter ;
And We put covers over their hearts and deafness in their ears that they should not understand it .
So when you invoke your Lord alone in the Qur &apos;an they turn their backs and walk away .
We know well with what ( intent ) they hear you , for when they confer privately the wicked say : &quot; You follow but a man deluded . &quot;
See , what comparisons they coin for you , and go astray , and thus cannot find the way .
Yet they say : &quot; When we are turned to bones and bits , shall we be raised as a new creation ? &quot;
Tell them : &quot; ( Even if ) you turn to stones or steel ,
Or some other created thing which may seem to you most difficult ( to create ) ! &quot;
They will then say : &quot; Who will revert us back ? &quot;
Say : &quot; He who originated you in the first place . &quot;
They will shake their heads at you and say : &quot; When will that be ? &quot;
Say : &quot; In the near future , perhaps ,
&quot; On the day when He will call you , and you will answer with His praises and imagine you did not tarry but a while . &quot;
Tell My creatures only to speak words that are good .
Verily Satan sows dissensions : Satan is indeed the acknowledged enemy of mankind .
Your Lord knows you better : He may have mercy on you if He please , or punish you if He will .
Yet We have not sent you as warden over them .
Your Lord knows whoever is in the heavens and the earth .
We exalted some of the prophets over the others ; and to David We gave the Book of Psalms .
Say : &quot; Call those whom you imagine to be gods besides Him ; yet they have no power to relieve you of any distress or to avert it . &quot;
Those they invoke themselves seek the way to their Lord , ( striving ) which one of them shall be nearest ( to Him ) ; and hope for His grace , and dread His punishment .
Indeed , the punishment of your Lord is to be feared !
There is not a habitation We shall not destroy before the Day of Resurrection , or not inflict severe punishment upon it .
This is in accordance with the law ( of God ) .
Nothing could stop Us from sending signs except that the earlier people had rejected them as lies .
We sent to Thamud the she-camel as a token to make it clear to them , but they treated her cruelly ; and We send signs only to deter .
When We said to you : &quot; Verily your Lord circumscribes mankind , &quot; and showed you the vision and the accursed tree of the Qur &apos;an , it was as a bone of contention for men .
Thus do We ( instil ) fear in them ; but they only transgress the more .
When We asked the angels to bow before Adam , they all bowed but Iblis , who said : &quot; Can I bow before him whom You created from clay ? &quot;
( And ) said : &quot; Look !
This is what you have honoured above me !
If You defer ( my term ) till the Day of Resurrection , I will bring his progeny into complete subjugation , barring a few . &quot;
( And God ) said : &quot; Away !
Whosoever of them follows you will surely have Hell with you as requital -- an ample recompense .
Mislead any of them you may with your voice , attack them with your cavalry and soldiers on foot , share their wealth and children with them , and make promises to them . &quot; -- But the promises of Satan are nothing but deceit .
&quot; You will surely have no power over My devotees : Your Lord is sufficient as their protector . &quot;
It is your Lord who drives your ships across the seas that you may seek of His bounty .
He is verily kind to you .
When a calamity befalls you on the sea , all those you invoke fail you except Him .
But when He brings you safely to the shore , you turn away , for man is most ungrateful .
Have you then become so sure that He will not cleave the earth and sink you in it by the shore , or send a gale against you , when you will not find any protector .
Or you feel so secure that He will not send you back ( to sea ) again or send a gravel-hurtling storm against you , and drown you for your ingratitude ?
Then you will not find any avenger against Us .
Indeed We have honoured the children of Adam , and carried them over land and sea , provided them with good things for their sustenance , and exalted them over many of Our creatures .
The day We shall summon all men with their leaders , whosoever is given his record in his right hand will be able to read his account , and none will be wronged the breadth of a thread .
But whoso has been blind in this world shall be blind in the world to come , even farther astray from the path .
They had almost led you away from what has been revealed to you , that you may invent things about Us besides those revealed , when they would have taken you as friend .
If We had not kept you constant you had almost leaned towards them .
In that case We would have made you taste a double anguish of life and a double anguish of death , and then you would not have been able to find a helper against Us for yourself .
They had nearly expelled you from the land and driven you away from it . But then , they too would have stayed but a little after you .
This has been Our way with the apostles whom We sent before you . You will not find any variation in Our line of action .
Observe the service of prayer from the sun &apos;s declining from the meridian to the darkening of the night , and the recitation at dawn .
Indeed the Recitation at dawn is palpably evident .
Say a supererogatory prayer at the hour of the first watch : Your Lord may raise you to a most exalted station .
And pray : &quot; O my Lord , let my entry be with honour , and let my exit be with honour , and grant me power from You which would help ( sustain ) me . &quot;
And say : &quot; Truth has come and falsehood nullified . &quot; Verily falsehood is perishable .
What We have sent down of the Qur &apos;an is a healing and a grace for the faithful , and adds only loss for the sinners .
When We are gracious to man he turns away and moves aside ; yet when evil befalls him he begins to despair .
Say : &quot; Each one acts according to his disposition , but your Lord knows well who follow the right path . &quot;
They ask you about revelation .
Say , revelation is by the command of your Lord , and that you have been given but little knowledge .
If We pleased We could take away what We have revealed to you . Then you will not find any one to plead for it with Us ,
Unless your Lord have mercy .
His blessings on you are great indeed .
Say : &quot; Surely if men and jinns get together to produce the like of this ( Qur &apos;an ) , they will not be able to produce the like of it , however they might assist one another .
We have given examples of every kind to men in this Qur &apos;an in various ways , and even then most men disdain everything but unbelief ,
And say : &quot; We will not believe you until you make a spring of water gush forth from the earth for us ;
Or , until you acquire an orchard of date-palm trees and grapes , and produce rivers flowing through it ;
Or , let chunks of sky fall over us , as you assert ( you will ) ; or , bring God and the angels as a surety ;
Or , you come to possess a house of gold ; or ascend to the skies , though we shall not believe in your having ascended till you bring down a book for us which we could read . &quot;
Say : &quot; Glory to my Lord .
I am only man and a messenger . &quot;
Nothing prevented men from believing when guidance came to them , other than ( what ) they said : &quot; Has God sent ( only ) a man as messenger ? &quot;
Say : &quot; If angels had peopled the earth and walked about in peace and quiet , We would surely have sent to them an angel as messenger .
Tell them : &quot; God is sufficient witness between me and you , for He knows His creatures well , and is well-informed . &quot;
He is guided whom God guides . As for him He allows to go astray , you will not find a protector other than Him .
We shall raise them on the Day of Resurrection in their own image , blind and dumb and deaf : Their habitation will be Hell .
Every time ( its fire ) subsides We will intensify its flame .
This will be their retribution for having denied Our signs and said : &quot; Once we are turned to bones and bits , can we be raised as a new creation ? &quot;
Do they not perceive that God , who created the heavens and the earth , has the power to create the like of them ?
There is no doubt that . He has fixed a term for them .
Even then the wicked disdain everything but unbelief .
Say : &quot; Even if you owned the stores of the mercy of my Lord , you would have held them back for fear of spending them , for man is niggardly . &quot;
We gave Moses nine clear signs ; so ask the children of Israel .
When ( Moses ) came to them the Pharaoh said : &quot; I think , O Moses , you have been deluded . &quot;
He replied : &quot; You know that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent these ( signs ) as cogent proof . I truly think , O Pharaoh , your days are done . &quot;
Then he sought to turn them out of the land , but We drowned him and all his followers .
After this We told the children of Israel : &quot; Dwell in the land . When the promise of reckoning comes , We shall bring you together from a motley crowd .
We have sent it down with truth , and with truth has ( the Qur &apos;an ) come down .
And We have sent you only to give good news and to warn .
We have divided the Qur &apos;an into parts that you may recite it to men slowly , with deliberation . That is why We sent it down by degrees .
Say : &quot; Believe in it or do not believe : Those who were given knowledge before it bow in adoration when it is read out to them ,
And say : &quot; Glory be to our Lord .
The promise of our Lord has indeed been fulfilled . &quot;
And weeping they kneel down , and this increases their humility .
Say : &quot; Call Him Allah or call Him Ar-Rahman ; whatever the name you call Him by , all His names are beautiful . &quot;
Do not say your prayers too loudly or in too low a voice , but follow a middle coarse .
And say : &quot; All praise be to God who has neither begotten a son nor has a partner in His kingdom ; nor has He need of any one to protect Him from ignominy .
So extol Him by extolling His majesty . &quot;
ALL PRAISE BE to God who has revealed to His votary the Book which is free of all obliquity ,
Immutable , so that it may warn of a severe punishment from Him ; and give happy tidings to those who believe and do the right that there is a better reward ( of Paradise ) for them ,
Where they will abide for ever ;
And that it may warn those who say : &quot; God has begotten a son . &quot;
They have no knowledge of this , as their fathers did not have .
How terrible are the words they utter !
They speak nothing but lies .
Will you kill yourself for grief of them if they do not believe in this presentation ?
We have made whatever exists on the earth its adornment to test and try them ( and ) know who acts better ;
For We shall certainly turn it to barren dust .
Do you think the men of the cave and Ar-Raqim were so strange among Our signs ?
When those young men took shelter in the cave , and prayed : &quot; O Lord , grant us Your favour and dispose our affair aright , &quot;
We sealed off their ears in the cave for a number of years ,
Then roused them to ascertain which of the two groups could account for the period they had stayed .
We narrate their story to you in all truth . They were a few young men who believed in their Lord ; so We gave them greater guidance .
And strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said : &quot; Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth .
We shall invoke no god beside Him , for we shall have uttered a blasphemy then .
As for these our people here , they have taken to other gods apart from Him .
Then why do they not bring a clear authority for them ?
Who is more wicked than he who fabricates a lie against God ? &quot;
( And they said to each other : ) &quot; Now that you have withdrawn from them and what they worship beside God , it is better to take refuge in the cave . Your Lord may bestow of His mercy on you , and facilitate your affair . &quot;
You may well have seen when the sun came up it moved away to the right of the cave , and when it went down it turned away to the left , and they stayed in its open space .
This was among the signs of God .
Whoever is guided by God follows the right path ; and whosoever goes astray will not find a guide to show him the way .
You may have thought that they were awake , yet they were asleep . We made them turn right and left , while their dog lay with his forelegs stretched across the threshold .
If you had looked at them you would have surely turned away and fled with horror at the sight .
Even so We roused them that they may question one another .
One of them asked : &quot; How long have you stayed here ? &quot;
They said : &quot; A day or less than a day . &quot;
&quot; Your Lord knows best , &quot; they said , &quot; how long you have stayed .
So send one of you to the town with this money of yours to look for wholesome food and bring it for you ; but he should be careful not to let your presence known .
If they come to know of you they will stone you to death , or force you to go back to their creed ; then you will never succeed . &quot;
Thus did We inform the people about them that they may know the promise of God is true , and there is no doubt that the Hour will come .
As they were arguing among themselves as to what should be done with them , ( some ) said : &quot; Erect a monument over them .
Their Lord is best cognisant of them . &quot;
Those who prevailed , said : &quot; We shall build a place of worship over their ( sepulchre ) . &quot;
Some will say : &quot; They were three , and their dog was the fourth ; &quot; and some will also say : &quot; They were five and their dog was the sixth , &quot; -- guessing in the dark . And some will even say : &quot; They were seven , and their dog the eighth . &quot;
Say : &quot; My Lord alone knows best their number ; none but only a few know of them . &quot;
So do not argue about it with them but lightly , and do not enquire about them from any one of them .
Do not say of any thing : &quot; I will do it tomorrow , &quot;
Without ( adding ) , &quot; if God may please ; &quot; and think of your Lord in ease you forget , and say : &quot; Perhaps my Lord will show me a nearer way to rectitude . &quot;
( It is said ) they stayed in the cave three hundred years and nine .
You say : &quot; God only knows how long they stayed .
He alone knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth .
How distinctly He sees and hears !
They have no other guardian but Him , and He does not share His authority with any one . &quot;
Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord .
There is no one who can change the word of God ; and you will not find refuge except in Him .
Persevere with those who call on their Lord morning and evening , seeking His magnificence . Do not turn your eyes away from them , seeking the splendours of this world , and do not follow him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance , who follows his own lust and exceeds the bound .
Say : &quot; The truth is from your Lord : So believe if you like , or do not believe if you will . &quot;
We have prepared for the sinners a fire which will envelope them in its tent .
If they ask for water they will be helped to liquid like molten brass that would scald their mouths .
How evil the drink , and evil the resting-place !
But surely We do not let the reward of those who believe and do the right to go waste .
There will be gardens of Eden for them , with rivers flowing by , where they will be decked in bracelets of gold , with silken robes of green and of brocades to wear , reclining on couches .
How excellent the guerdon , and excellent the resting-place !
Tell them the parable of two men . We gave one two gardens of grapes surrounded by date-palm trees , with corn fields in between .
Each of the gardens yielded its fruit and did not withhold the least ; and We made a stream flow in between them .
So he became rich .
Arguing one day with his friend he said : &quot; I have more wealth than you and more powerful kinsmen . &quot;
And he walked into his garden , and , ( forgetting ) his limit , said : &quot; I cannot imagine that this will ever be ruined ,
Nor can I think that the Hour ( of Doom ) will come , And even if I am brought back to my Lord , I will surely find a better place there than this . &quot;
Disputing with him , his companion said : &quot; Do you disbelieve in Him who created you from dust , then a drop of semen , then formed you into a man ?
And He is God , my Lord , and I do not associate any one with my Lord .
When you entered your garden , why did you not say : &apos; As God may please ; &apos; for no one has power except given by God ? Though you see me poorer in wealth and children than you ,
Yet , my Lord may haply give me a garden better than yours , and He may send a thunder-bolt , from the skies and in the morning it will be a barren plain ;
Or else of a morning its water may sink underground , and you will not find a trace of it . &quot;
And his vines were overtaken ( with disaster ) , and he began to wring his hands ( at the loss ) of what he had spent on them , for the vines had fallen upon their trellises ; and he said : &quot; Would to God that I had not associated any one with my Lord . &quot;
He had no body to help him other than God , nor was he able to save himself .
The jurisdiction in this province belongs to God .
His is the best reward , and His the best requital .
Present to them the example of the life of this world so like the water We send down from the skies that mingles with the earth to nourish its vegetation , which then on the morrow turns to stubble and is blown away by the wind .
God has power over everything .
Wealth and children are only the gloss of this world , but good deeds that abide are better with your Lord for recompense , and better for expectation .
The day We shall move the mountains , and you see the earth an open plain , We shall gather them together , leaving none behind .
They will be arraigned before their Lord row on row , ( and He will say ) : &quot; Well , you have come to Us as We had first created you , even though you imagined We had fixed no time for this meeting . &quot;
The ledger ( of their deeds ) would be placed before them . Then you will see the sinners terrified at its contents , and say : &quot; Alas , what a written revelation this , which has not left unaccounted the smallest or the greatest thing ! &quot;
They will find in it whatsoever they had done .
Your Lord does not wrong any one .
When We said to the angels : &quot; Bow before Adam in adoration , &quot; they all bowed but Iblis .
He was one of the jinni and rebelled against his Lord &apos;s command .
And yet you take him and his offspring as your friends instead of Me , even though they are your enemies .
How sad a substitute for the evil-doers !
I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth , nor their own creation . I would not take as helpers those who lead ( men ) astray .
The day He will say : &quot; Call those you had called My compeers , &quot; they will call them , but will get no response , and We shall place a gulf between them .
The sinners will see the Fire and know that they will be thrown into it and will not find a way of escape from it .
We have explained in various ways all things to men in this Qur &apos;an ; but of all things man is most contentious .
There is nothing to prevent men from believing when the guidance has come to them , and asking for their Lord &apos;s forgiveness , unless they want the example of earlier people visited upon them , or the punishment to appear right before their eyes .
We never send apostles but to convey happy tidings , and to warn .
But those who disbelieve contend with false arguments to nullify the truth .
They make a mockery of My revelations and of what they had been warned .
Who is more unjust than he who , on being reminded of his Lord &apos;s revelations , turns away from them , and forgets the evil deeds he had committed in the past .
Verily We have placed a covering on their hearts so that they do not understand , and a deafness in their ears so that however you may call them to guidance they will never be guided aright .
But your Lord is forgiving , full of benevolence .
If He had pleased to punish them for their doings He would have punished them immediately .
But a term is fixed for them from which they will find no escape .
As for these habitations , We destroyed them only when they transgressed ; even so We had fixed a time for their annihilation .
When Moses said to his servant ( Joshua ) : &quot; I will not give up till I reach the confluence of two oceans , or I will journey on and on . &quot;
When they reached the confluence they forgot the fish ( they had brought as food ) which swiftly made its way into the sea .
When they had gone past ( the confluence ) , Moses said to his servant : &quot; Give me my breakfast .
I am exhausted from this journey . &quot;
He said : &quot; You see , I forgot the fish on the rock where we had stopped . Only Satan made me forget to mention this ; but the wonder is the fish escaped to the sea . &quot;
Moses said : &quot; But that is exactly what we were seeking . &quot;
So they retraced their steps .
Then they found one of Our votaries , whom We had blessed and given knowledge from Us .
Moses said to him : &quot; May I attend upon you that you may instruct me in the knowledge you have been taught of the right way ? &quot;
He said : &quot; You will not be able to bear with me .
&quot; How can you bear that which is beyond your comprehension ? &quot;
&quot; You will find me patient if God wills , &quot; said Moses ; &quot; and I will not disobey you in any thing . &quot;
&quot; If you must follow me , &quot; he said , &quot; do not ask me any thing until I speak of it to you myself . &quot;
So they set out till they ( came to the quay ) and went on board a ship in which he made a hole , ( and Moses said : ) &quot; You have made a hole in the boat to drown its passengers ?
You have done a strange thing ! &quot;
&quot; Did I not tell you , &quot; he replied , &quot; that you will not be able to bear with me ? &quot;
( Moses ) said : &quot; Do not hold me for having forgotten , and do not reprove me and make my task difficult . &quot;
The two went on till they came to a boy , whom he killed .
Moses exclaimed : &quot; You have killed an innocent soul who had taken no life .
You have done a most abominable thing ! &quot;
He said : &quot; Did I not tell you you will not be able to bear with me ? &quot;
Moses said : &quot; If I ask you any thing again then do not keep me with you . You have my apology . &quot;
The two went on till they came upon some villagers , and asked the people for food , but they refused to entertain them .
There they found a wall that was crumbling , which he repaired .
Moses remarked : &quot; You could have demanded wages for it if you liked . &quot;
&quot; This is the parting of our &quot; ways , &quot; he said .
&quot; But I will now explain the things you could not bear :
That boat belonged to poor people who used to toil on the sea . I damaged it because there was a king after them who used to seize every ship by force .
As for the boy , his parents were believers , but we feared that he would harass them with defiance and disbelief .
We hoped their Lord would give them a substitute better than him in virtue and goodness .
Their father was an upright man . So your Lord willed that on reaching the age of maturity they should dig out their treasure as a favour from their Lord .
So , I did not do that of my own accord . This is the explanation of things you could not bear with patience . &quot;
They ask you about Dhu &apos;l-Qarnain .
Say : &quot; I will cite before you his commemoration . &quot; We gave him authority in the land and means of accomplishing every end .
So he followed a certain road
Till he reached the point of the setting sun , and saw it set behind a muddy lake , and near it found a people .
We said : &quot; O Dhu &apos;l-Qarnain , you may either punish them or treat them with kindness . &quot;
He said : &quot; I shall punish whosoever is wicked . He will then be sent back to his Lord who will inflict on him a terrible punishment .
But he who believes and does the right will have an excellent reward , and we shall make things easy for him . &quot;
He then followed ( another ) road
Till he reached the point of the rising sun , and saw it rise over a people for whom We had provided no shelter against it .
It was so , for We were fully informed about him .
He then followed ( another ) road
Till he reached a place between two mountains , and found this side of it a people who understood but little of what was spoken .
They said : &apos; O Dhu &apos;l-Qarnain , Gog and Magog are oppressing the land . May we pay you some tribute so that you could build a rampart between us and them ? &quot;
He said : &quot; The ability my Lord has given me is better .
So help me with your manual labour ; I will build a wall between you and them .
Bring me ingots of iron , &quot; ( which they did ) until the space between two mountain sides was filled up .
&quot; Blow your bellows , &quot; he said ; ( and they blew ) until it was red hot . &quot; Bring me molten brass , &quot; he said , &quot; that I may pour over it . &quot;
Thus ( Gog and Magog ) could neither climb over it nor dig a hole through ( the rampart ) .
&quot; This is the benevolence of my Lord , &quot; he said ; &quot; but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass , He will reduce it to a mound of dust ; and the promise of my Lord is true . &quot;
We shall leave them on that day surging like waves pressing one against the other , and the trumpet blast will be sounded , when We shall gather them all together .
Then We shall bring Hell right before the infidels
Whose eyes were veiled against My warning , and they could not hear .
Do the unbelievers think they can make My own creatures their protectors against Me ?
We have prepared Hell for the hospitality of infidels .
Say : &quot; Shall I tell you whose labour will be wasted ?
Theirs whose effort is misspent in pursuit of the pleasures of the world , even though they think they are doing good things . &quot;
They are those who reject the signs of their Lord , and the meeting with Him .
So their good deeds will be fruitless , and on the Day of Judgement We shall not appoint any weighing for them .
Their requital will be Hell , because they disbelieved and mocked My signs and messengers .
But surely those who believe and do the right will have gardens of Paradise as gift ,
Where they will abide for ever , never wanting a change .
Say : &quot; If the ocean turned to ink for writing down the colloquy of my Lord , the ocean itself would be exhausted ere the words ( and wonders ) of my Lord come to end , even if we brought another like it for replenishment . &quot;
Say : &quot; I am only a man like you , but it has been communicated to me that your Lord is one and single God , and that whosoever hopes to meet his Lord should do what is right , and not associate any one in the worship of his Lord . &quot;
KAF HA YA &apos; AIN SAD .
Commemorate the beneficence of your Lord on Zachariah , His devotee ,
When he called to his Lord inwardly ,
And said : &quot; O my Lord , my bones decay , my head is white and hoary , yet in calling You , O Lord , I have never been deprived .
But I fear my relatives after me ; and my wife is barren .
So grant me a successor as a favour from You
Who will be heir to me , and heir to the house of Jacob ; and make him obedient to You , O Lord . &quot;
&quot; O Zachariah , &quot; ( it was ) said , &quot; We give you good news of a son by name of John . &apos; 
To none have We attributed the name before . &quot;
&quot; How can I have a son , O Lord &quot; he said , &quot; when my wife is barren and I am old and decrepit ? &quot;
( The angel ) answered : &quot; Thus will it be . Your Lord said : &apos; This is easy for Me ; for when I brought you into being you were nothing . &apos; 
He said : &quot; O Lord , give me a token . &quot;
&quot; Though sound , &quot; He answered , &quot; you will not talk to any one for three nights running . &quot;
So he came from the chamber to his people , and suggested to them ( by signs ) to sing the praises of the Lord morning and evening .
( We said : ) &quot; O John , hold fast to the Book ; &quot; and We gave him wisdom right from boyhood ,
And compassion from Us , and goodness .
So he was devout ,
And kind to his parents , neither arrogant nor disobedient .
So peace on him the day he was born , the day he will die , and the day that he will be raised from the dead .
Commemorate Mary in the Book .
When she withdrew from her family to a place in the East
And took cover from them , We sent a spirit of Ours to her who appeared before her in the concrete form of a man .
&quot; I seek refuge in the Merciful from you , if you fear Him , &quot; she said .
He replied : &quot; I am only a messenger from your Lord ( sent ) to bestow a good son on you . &quot;
&quot; How can I have a son , &quot; she said , &quot; when no man has touched me , nor am I sinful ? &quot;
Your Lord said : &apos; It is easy for Me , &apos; and that : &apos; We shall make him a sign for men and a blessing from Us . &apos; This is a thing already decreed . &quot;
When she conceived him she went away to a distant place .
The birth pangs led her to the trunk of a date-palm tree .
&quot; Would that I had died before this , &quot; she said , &quot; and become a thing forgotten , unremembered . &quot;
Then ( a voice ) called to her from below : &quot; Grieve not ; your Lord has made a rivulet gush forth right below you .
Shake the trunk of the date-palm tree , and it will drop ripe dates for you .
Eat and drink , and be at peace .
If you see any man , tell him : &apos; I have verily vowed a fast to Ar-Rahman and cannot speak to any one this day . &apos; 
Then she brought the child to her people .
They exclaimed : &quot; O Mary , you have done a most astonishing thing !
O sister of Aaron , your father was not a wicked person , nor your mother sinful ! &quot;
But she pointed towards him .
&quot; How can we talk to one , &quot; they said , &quot; who is only an infant in the cradle ? &quot;
&quot; I am a servant of God , &quot; he answered . &quot; He has given me a Book and made me a prophet ,
And blessed me wherever I may be , and enjoined on me worship and zakat for as long as I live ,
And be dutiful to my mother . He has not made me haughty or rebellious .
There was peace on me the day I was born , and will be the day I die , and on the day I will be raised from the dead . &quot;
This was Jesus , son of Mary : A true account they contend about .
It does not behove God to have a son .
Too immaculate is He !
When He decrees a thing He has only to say : &quot; Be &quot; , and it is .
( Jesus only said : ) &quot; Surely God is my Lord and your Lord , so worship Him .
This is the straight path . &quot;
Yet the sectarians differed among themselves . Alas for the unbelievers when they see the Terrible Day !
How keenly would they hear and see when they come before Us then , even though today the evil-doers are lost in palpable error .
Warn them of that day of pining when all matters will have been settled , though they would still be unaware and unbelieving ( of the truth ) .
Verily We shall inherit the earth and whosoever is on it , and to Us they will return .
Commemorate Abraham in the Book : He was upright , a prophet .
Remember , when he said to his father : &quot; O my father , why do you worship that which can neither hear nor see nor even profit you the least ?
O my father , to me has come such knowledge as never came to you . So follow me that I may show you the right path .
Why do you worship Satan , O father ? Verily Satan was disobedient to Ar-Rahman .
O my father , I fear lest a punishment from Ar-Rahman should befall you , and you should become a friend of the Devil . &quot;
He said : &quot; Are you averse to my gods , O Abraham ?
If you do not desist , I shall have you stoned to death .
So go away for a while from me . &quot;
He answered : &quot; Peace be on you .
I will seek forgiveness of my Lord for you . He has been gracious to me .
I will leave you and those you invoke apart from God , and pray to my Lord . Haply in praying to my Lord I will not be deprived . &quot;
Thus , when he left them and the ( idols ) they worshipped , We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob , and made each of them a prophet ,
And bestowed on them some of Our blessings , and gave them high renown .
Commemorate Moses in the Book .
He was a chosen one , both an apostle and a prophet .
We called him from the right side of the Mount , and brought him close for communion ;
And bestowed on him his brother Aaron , a prophet , through Our benevolence .
Commemorate Ishmael in the Book .
He was true of his promise , and a messenger , a prophet .
He enjoined on his household worship and zakat , and he was obedient to his Lord .
Commemorate Enoch in the Book .
He was a truthful person and a prophet ,
And We raised him to an exalted station .
These are ( some of ) those who were favoured by God among the prophets of the progeny of Adam , and of those We bore in the ark with Noah , and the offspring of Abraham and Israel , and of those We guided and We chose , for they bowed weeping in adoration when the revelations of Ar-Rahman were recited to them .
But they are succeeded by a generation who neglect their devotional obligations and follow only earthly pleasures ; but they will reach the wrong road and meet destruction ,
Except those who repent and come to believe and do the right .
These will enter Paradise and will not be wronged the least
In the gardens of Eden promised by Ar-Rahman to His creatures in the unknown ( future ) .
Verily His promise will come to pass .
They will hear no vain talk there , but only salutations of peace , and they will have their sustenance morning and evening . &quot;
This is the Paradise those of Our creatures will inherit who take heed and fear the displeasure of God .
&quot; We do not come down , &quot; ( will the angels say ) &quot; but only by your Lord &apos;s command . &quot;
To Him belongs whatever lies before us and behind us , and the space in between . Your Lord does not ever forget :
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them .
Therefore worship Him , and be constant in His worship .
Do you know any namesake of His ?
Yet man says : &quot; When I am dead , will I come to life again ? &quot;
Does man not remember that before We created him he was nothing ?
By your Lord , We shall gather them and the devils together , then bring them crawling on their knees around Hell .
We shall pull out of every section those who were most perversely rebellious against Ar-Rahman .
We know best who deserve to be burnt in ( the Fire ) .
There is not one among you who will not reach it . Your Lord has made this incumbent on Himself .
We shall deliver those who took heed for themselves , and leave the evil-doers kneeling there .
When Our lucid revelations are read out to them , the infidels say to those who believe : &quot; Which of the two groups is better in standing , and whose company is more excellent ? &quot;
How many generations that had far more wealth and ostentation have We laid low before them !
Say : &quot; Ar-Rahman extends the life of those who are astray until they come to realise what had been promised them was either ( physical ) affliction or ( the terror ) of Resurrection . Then will they know who is worse in position , and who is weak in supporters .
God gives greater guidance to those who are guided ; and good deeds that endure are better with your Lord for reward , and better for consequence .
Have you seen him who denies Our revelations , and says : &quot; I will certainly be given wealth and children . &quot;
Has he peeped into the Unknown , or obtained a promise from Ar-Rahman ?
Never so . We shall certainly write down what he says , and prolong the extent of his punishment .
All that he claims will revert to Us , and he will come before Us all alone .
They have taken other gods apart from God that they might be a strength to them .
Never . They will deny their devotion and become their adversaries .
Do you not see that We have set the devils against the infidels to rouse and instigate them ?
So , do not be hasty with them . We are counting their number ( of days ) .
The day We shall usher the righteous before Ar-Rahman like envoys into the presence of a king ,
And drive the wicked into Hell like cattle driven to water ,
None will have power to intercede for them except one who obtains a promise from Ar-Rahman .
They say : &quot; God has begotten a son . &quot;
You have uttered a grievous thing
Which would cleave the skies asunder , rend the earth , and split the mountains ,
For they have attributed a son to Ar-Rahman ,
When it does not behove the Merciful to have a son .
There is no one in the heavens and the earth but comes before Ar-Rahman in all obedience .
He has counted them and calculated their number .
Every one of them will come before Him all alone on the Day of Resurrection .
Surely Ar-Rahman will show love for those who believe and do the right .
So We have made this ( Qur &apos;an ) easy in your tongue that you may give good news to those who take heed , and warn the people who are contentious .
How many generations have We laid low before them .
Do you see any sign of them , or hear the least whisper of them ?
TA HA .
We have not sent down the Qur &apos;an to you that you should be burdened ,
But as admonition for him who fears --
A revelation from Him who created the earth and the high ascending skies ,
The ever-merciful , established on the throne ( of authority ) .
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth and in between them , belongs to Him , as whatever lies under the earth .
Whether you say a thing aloud or inaudibly , He has knowledge of the secret and the hidden .
God : There is no god but He .
To Him belong the attributes most beautiful .
Has the story of Moses come to you ?
I have seen a fire . I may haply be able to bring an ember from it , or find direction by the fire . &quot;
When he approached it , a voice called out :
&quot; O Moses , I am verily your Lord , so take off your shoes , for you are in the holy plain of Towa .
I have chosen you , so listen to what is revealed to you .
I am God , and there is no god but I , so serve Me , and observe acts of prayer to remember Me .
Verily the Hour ( of the great change ) is about to come .
I keep it secret that every soul may be rewarded for its endeavour .
So do not let those who do not believe in it and follow their vain desires , turn you away from it .
What is that in your right band , O Moses ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s my staff , &quot; he answered ; &quot; I lean on it , and fell leaves for my goats with it , and I have other uses for it . &quot;
&quot; Throw it down , O Moses , &quot; said ( the Voice ) .
So he threw it down , and lo , it became a running serpent .
&quot; Catch it , &quot; said He , &quot; and have no fear ; We shall revert it to its former state .
And face what is to come with patience , your hand will not be tarnished with blame : Another sign
That We may go on showing you Our greater signs .
Go to the Pharaoh as he has become exceedingly rebellious . &quot;
Moses said : &quot; O my Lord , enlarge my breast ,
And make my mission easy .
Remove the defect of my tongue
That they may understand my speech ,
And give me as assistant from my family
Aaron my brother
To strengthen me
And share my task ,
That we may sing Your praises much ,
And remember you a great deal .
Surely You know us well . &quot;
He answered : &quot; Granted is your prayer , O Moses .
We have bestowed Our favour on you before this
When We told your mother what We relate :
&apos;Put him in a wooden box and cast it in the river . The river will cast it on the bank .
An enemy of Ours , and his , will retrieve it . &apos; We bestowed Our love on you that you may be reared under Our eyes .
Then your sister followed you , and said ( to the people who had retrieved the child ) : &apos; Should I guide you to a person who can nurse him ? &apos;
We thus brought you back to your mother that her heart may be cheered , and she may not grieve .
( Remember ) when you killed a man We saved you from anguish ; and tested and steeled you ( in other ways ) .
Afterwards you sojourned for several years with the people of Midian ; then you came up to the measure ,
And I chose you for Myself .
Go with My signs , you and your brother , and do not be lax in remembering Me .
Then go to the Pharaoh as he has become exceedingly rebellious .
Speak to him gently . He may possibly take heed or may come to have fear . &quot;
They said : &quot; O our Lord , we are really frightened lest he behave insolently with us or become violent . &quot;
( The Lord ) said : &quot; Be not afraid .
I am verily with you , and I hear and see .
So go to him and say : &apos; The two of us have indeed been sent by your Lord . So let the children of Israel come with us , and do not oppress them .
We have come to you with a token from your Lord . Peace on him who follows the way of guidance .
It has been revealed to us that punishment will befall him who denies and turns away .
He asked : &quot; Who then is that Lord of yours , O Moses ? &quot;
( Moses ) said : &quot; Our Lord is He who gave everything its natural form and directed it . &quot;
( The Pharaoh ) said : &quot; And what about the former generations ? &quot;
( Moses ) replied : &quot; Knowledge of that is with my Lord ( recorded ) in the Book .
My Lord neither errs nor forgets . &quot;
It is He who made the earth a bed for you , and traced for you paths upon it , and sends down water from the sky , and brings out through it every kind of vegetation
To eat and feed your cattle .
Surely there are signs in these for those who are wise .
We created you from the earth and will revert you back to it ; and raise you up from it a second time .
So We showed him all Our signs , but he denied them and refused ,
And said : &quot; Have you come to us , O Moses , to drive us out of our land with your witchery ?
We shall certainly meet you with like magic . So make an appointment when we and you could meet on common ground , which neither we nor you should fail to keep . &quot;
Said ( Moses ) : &quot; Let your meeting be on the day of the Feast , and let people assemble in broad daylight . &quot;
After this the Pharaoh withdrew and settled his stratagem , then came back .
Moses said to them : &quot; Woe betide you . Do not fabricate a lie against God , or He will destroy you with some affliction .
For he who fabricates lies is doomed to failure . &quot;
So they discussed their strategy among themselves and conferred privately ,
( And ) said : &quot; These two are surely magicians . They want to deprive you of your land with their magic , and eradicate your distinct way ( of life ) .
So prepare your strategy and come forward .
He alone shall win today who is superior . &quot;
They said : &quot; Either you cast ( your spell ) , O Moses , or we shall cast it first . &quot;
Moses said : &quot; No .
You cast it first &quot; Then it seemed to Moses that by their magic their cords and rods were flying ;
And Moses felt afraid within himself .
We said to him : &quot; Fear not . You will certainly be victorious .
Throw down what is in your right hand : It will swallow up what they have conjured . For what they have fashioned is only a trick of the sorcerer ; and a sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may come . &quot;
The magicians , ( seeing the miracle ) , fell down in prostration , saying : &quot; We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron . &quot;
( The Pharaoh ) said : &quot; You have come to believe without my dispensation .
Surely he is your chief who taught you magic .
I will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunks of date-palm trees . You will come to know whose punishment is harder and protracted . &quot;
They replied : &quot; We cannot choose you in the face of the clear testimony we have received , and over Him who created us . So do what you are determined to do .
All that you would do will only be confined to our life on earth .
We have certainly come to believe in our Lord that He may forgive our trespasses and the magic you have forced us to perform , for God is nobler and abiding . &quot;
Surely for him who comes before his Lord a sinner shall be Hell , where he will neither die nor live .
But whoever comes before Him a believer having done good deeds , will be raised to higher stations --
Gardens of Eden with rippling streams , where he will live for ever .
This is the recompense of those who achieve integrity .
We commanded Moses : &quot; Journey by night with Our creatures , and strike a dry path for them through the sea .
Do not fear being overtaken , nor have dread of any thing . &quot;
Then the Pharaoh followed them with his army , but the sea overpowered and engulfed them .
The Pharaoh had led his people astray , and did not rightly guide them .
O children of Israel , We delivered you from your enemy , and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount , and sent down for you manna and quails ,
( And said ) : &quot; Eat of the good things We have given you for food , and do not exceed the bounds ( of law ) in this , or My wrath will surely fall upon you ; and he who incurs My wrath will fall into the abyss .
Yet I am gracious to him who repents and believes , and does the right , and follows the straight path .
What made you hurry away , O Moses , from your people ? &quot;
He said : &quot; They are right behind me . I have hastened to You , O Lord , so that You may be pleased . &quot;
He said : &quot; We have put your people on trial in your absence ; and Sameri has led them astray . &quot;
So Moses returned to his people full of anger and regret .
&quot; O my people , &quot; he said , &quot; did not your Lord make you a better promise ?
Did the time of covenant seem too long to you ? Or did you wish the wrath of your Lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me ? &quot;
They said : &quot; We did not break our promise to you of our own will , but we were made to carry the loads of ornaments belonging to the people , which we threw ( into the fire ) , and so did Sameri .
Then he produced the image of a calf which mooed like a cow .
And they said : &apos; This is your god and the god of Moses ( whom ) he has neglected . &quot;
Did they not see that it did not give them any answer , nor had it power to do them harm or bring them gain ?
Aaron had indeed told them earlier : &quot; O my people , you are being only misled with this .
Surely your Lord is Ar-Rahman . So follow me and obey my command . &quot;
They said &quot; So long as Moses does not come back we are not going to give it up , and we will remain devoted to it . &quot;
But ( Moses ) said : &quot; O Aaron , when you saw that they had gone astray , what hindered you
From coming after me ?
Did you not disobey my command ? &quot; ( And Moses pulled him by the hair ) .
&quot; O son of my mother , &quot; ( Aaron cried ) , do not pull me by my beard or my hair !
I was really afraid you may say that I had created a rift among the children of Israel , and did not pay heed to your command . &quot;
Moses asked : &quot; O Sameri , what was the matter ? &quot;
He said : &quot; I saw what they did not see .
I picked up a handful of dust from the messenger &apos;s tracks and threw it in , for the idea seemed attractive to me . &quot;
( Moses ) said : &quot; Go hence !
All your life you are ( cursed ) to say : &apos; Do not touch me ; and a threat hangs over you which you will not be able to escape .
Look at your god to whom you are so attached : We shall verily burn it , and disperse its ashes into the sea .
Your god is only God . There is no other god but He .
His knowledge extends over everything . &quot;
Thus do We narrate some account to you of what has gone before , and We have truly given you a Reminder of Our own .
Whoever turns away from it will surely carry a burden on the Day of Judgement ,
And will live for ever under it . How evil the burden they will carry on the Day of Doom !
The day the trumpet blast is sounded We shall raise the sinners blind ,
Whispering to one another : &quot; You have tarried but ten days . &quot;
We know well what they will say when the most upright among them will say : &quot; You did not tarry more than a day . &quot;
They will ask you about the mountains .
Tell them : &quot; My Lord will uproot them from the base ,
And turn them into a level plain ,
Over which you will see no curves or elevations .
That day they will follow the summoner from whom there will be no receding ; and their voices will be hushed before Ar-Rahman , and you will not hear a sound but faint shuffling .
On that day no intercession will matter other than his whom Ar-Rahman grants permission and accepts .
He knows what is before them and hidden from them , but they cannot grasp it with their knowledge .
All heads will be bowed before the Living , the Eternal ; and whosoever bears a load of iniquity will be full of despair .
But he who has done good things and believes , will have no fear of either being wronged or deprived .
That is why We have sent it down as an eloquent Qur &apos;an , and explained in different ways the intimidations through it that they may haply take heed , or perhaps it may lead them to contemplate .
Exalted then be God , the real King ; and do not try to anticipate the Qur &apos;an before the completion of its revelation , but pray : &quot; O Lord , give me greater knowledge . &quot;
We had commanded Adam before , but he disregarded it : We found him lacking in resolution .
When We said to the angels : &apos; &apos; Bow before Adam , &apos; &apos; they all bowed but Iblis , who refused .
So We said ; &quot; O Adam , he is truly your enemy and your wife &apos;s . Do not let him have you turned out of Paradise and come to grief .
Verily you will have no hunger or nakedness there ,
Nor thirst nor exposure to the sun . &quot;
But then Satan tempted him by saying : &quot; O Adam , should I show you the tree of immortality , and a kingdom that will never know any wane ? &quot;
And both ate of ( its fruit ) , and their hidden parts were exposed to one another , and they patched the leaves of the garden ( to hide them ) .
Adam disobeyed his Lord , and went astray .
Then his Lord chose him and relented towards him , and showed him the way ;
( And ) said : &quot; Go down hence together , one the enemy of the other .
Then will guidance come to you from Me ; and whoever follows My direction will neither be disgraced nor be miserable .
But he who fails to heed My warning will have his means restricted ; and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him blind . &quot;
He will ask : &quot; O Lord , why have you raised me blind when I was able to see ? &quot;
( God ) will say : &quot; Because Our signs came to you , but you disregarded them . So shall We disregard you this day . &quot;
And that is how We requite him who is extravagant and does not believe the signs of his Lord ; and surely the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and persistent .
Did they not learn from the many generations that We destroyed before them , whose habitations they now frequent ?
Verily there are signs in this for men of understanding .
If the decree ( of respite ) had not been pronounced by your Lord , ( the inevitable judgement would have ensued ) ; but a term is fixed ( for everything ) .
So you bear with patience what they say , and sing the praises of your Lord before the rising and setting of the sun , and honour Him in the watches of the night , and then at the two ends of day , that you may find acceptance .
Do not covet what We have granted myriads of people of the pomp and glitter of this world to tempt them .
The means your Lord has given you are better far and more enduring .
Enjoin on your people service to God , and be yourself constant in it .
We do not ask you to provide : It is We who provide for you .
The reward is for piety and fear of God .
Yet they say : &quot; Why does he not bring a sign from his Lord ? &quot;
Have not clear proofs come to them in what is contained in the earlier Books ?
If We had destroyed them by some calamity sooner than this , they would have surely said : &quot; O Lord , if You had sent to us a messenger we would have followed Your command before being humbled and disgraced . &quot;
Say : &quot; Each one awaits the consequence ; so you wait . You will come to know soon who are the men of the straight path and who have come to guidance .
NEAR HAS COME the reckoning for men , but they turn away in remissness .
Never does a new reminder come to them from their Lord but they listen to it with dalliance .
Their minds are lost in frivolous pastimes ; and the evil-doers discuss secretly : &quot; Is he not but only a man like you ?
Then why are you taken in by magic seeingly ? &quot;
He said : &quot; My Lord knows whatever is spoken in the heavens and the earth . He hears all and knows everything . &quot;
Yet they say : &quot; These are only confused dreams , &quot; or rather : &quot; He has invented them ; &quot; or : &quot; He is only a poet .
Let him therefore bring a miracle to us as the earlier ( apostles ) were sent with . &quot;
Not one habitation that We destroyed before them had believed .
So how can they believe ?
Never did We send a message before you but through a man , whom We inspired . If you do not know , then ask the keepers of the oracles of God .
We did not make their bodies immune to hunger , nor were they immortal .
Then We made Our promise good to them and delivered whomsoever We pleased , and destroyed the transgressors .
We have sent down to you a Book which has a reminder for you . Do you not understand ?
How many habitations that were sinful have We demolished utterly , and raised other people after them .
Whensoever they sensed Our punishment they fled from them .
&quot; Do not flee ; go back to your halls of pleasure and your habitations , so that you may be interrogated . &quot;
&quot; Woe , alas , &quot; they said , &quot; we were really sinful . &quot;
And this remained their lament till We mowed them down and made them extinct .
We have not created the heavens and the earth , and all that lies between them , out of fun .
If We had pleased to make a plaything We could have made it Ourself , if We had cared to do so .
In fact We strike the truth against the false , which shatters it , and it disappears .
Woe to you for what you attribute ( to Him ) !
Whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him ; and those who are near Him do not disdain to worship Him or weary ( of His service ) ,
Nor cease to endeavour praising Him night and day .
Or have they taken gods from the earth who can raise the dead ?
Had there been gods apart from God , both ( the heavens and the earth ) would have been despoiled .
Much too glorious is God , the Lord of the mighty throne , for things they assert !
He cannot be questioned about what He does , but they will be questioned .
Have they taken gods besides God ?
Say : &quot; Then bring your proof .
Here is the Book of those who are with me , and the Book of those who have gone before me . &quot;
But most men do not know the truth and turn away .
We have not sent an apostle before you without instructing him that there is no god but I , so worship Me .
