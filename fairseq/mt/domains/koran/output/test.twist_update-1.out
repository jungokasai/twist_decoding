In the name of Allah , the Beneficent , the Merciful .
Praise be to Allah , the Lord of the Worlds ,
The Compassionate , the Merciful .
Sovereign of the Day of Recompense .
You ( alone ) we worship , and You ( Alone ) we ask for help ( for each and everything ) .
Guide us to the straight path ,
The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor , not of those who have incurred Your wrath , nor of those who have gone astray .
Alif-Lam-Meem . ( Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah , and to whomever He reveals , know their precise meanings . )
This is the Book ( the Quran ) , in which there is no doubt , a guide for the Muttaqun ( pious - see V. 2 : 2 ) .
Who believe in the unseen , and perform the prayer , and expend of that We have provided them ;
And those who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you , and they are certain of the Hereafter .
Those follow their Lord ’ s guidance , and it is they who are the felicitous .
As for the faithless , it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them , they will not believe .
Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing , and over their eyes is a veil , and for them is a great punishment .
Some people say , &quot; We believe in God and the Last Day , &quot; but they are not believers .
They seek to deceive Allah and the believers , but they deceive not except themselves .
In their hearts is a disease , and Allah increaseth their disease , and unto them shall be a torment afflictive , for they have been lying .
And when it is said to them , &quot; Do not cause corruption upon the earth , &quot; they say , &quot; Indeed , we are the doers of good . &quot;
Indeed , it is they who are the corrupters , but they do not desist .
And when it is said to them , “ Believe as the people believe , ” they say , “ Shall we believe as fools believe ? ”
Unquestionably , it is they who are the fools , but they know &#91; it &#93; not .
And when they meet the believers , they say : We believe ; but when they are alone with their Shaitans , they say : Surely we are with you , we were only mocking .
Allah mocks at them and leaves them to wander blindly in the wrong .
These are they who have exchanged guidance for guidance , so their trade did not profit them , nor are they guided .
Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire , then , when it lighted all around him , Allah took away their light and left them in darkness , where they saw nothing .
Deaf , dumb , blind ; so they will not return .
Or like a rainstorm from the sky , wherein is darkness , thunder , and lightning . They thrust their fingers in their ears at the sound of every thunderclaps for fear of death .
And Allah is ever , over the disbelievers , Perfect in Ability .
The lightning almost snatches away their sight : whenever it gives them light , they walk in it , and when the darkness falls upon them , they stand still .
And had Allah willed , He could have taken away their hearing and their sight ; verily Allah is over everything Potent .
O mankind , worship your Lord , who created you and those before you , that you may become righteous -
Who has made the earth a resting place for you and the sky a canopy , and sent down water from the sky with which He brought forth fruits as a reward for you , so that Allah does not knoweth ,
And if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to Our servant , then produce a chapter like it , and call upon your witnesses besides Allah , if you are truthful .
But if you do not - and you will not - then fear the Fire , whose fuel is people and stones , prepared for the disbelievers .
And give glad tidings ( O Muhammad SAW ) to those who believe ( in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism ) and do righteous good deeds , that for them will be Gardens under which rivers flow ( Paradise ) .
And therein they shall be purified , and therein they shall be abiders .
Verily Allah is not ashamed to propound a similitude , be it of a gnat or of aught above it ; then as for those who believe , they know that it is the truth from their Lord .
As for those who disbelieve , they say , “ What did God intend by this parable ? ”
He misleads many thereby , and guides many thereby ; but He misleads thereby only the evildoers ,
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it , and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined ( as regards Allah &apos;s Religion of Islamic Monotheism ) , and do mischief on earth , it is they who are the losers .
How can you disbelieve in God , seeing you were lifeless and He gave you life , then He shall make you die , then He shall give you life , then unto Him you shall be returned ?
He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth ; then when He directed Himself to the heavens and made them seven heavens ; and He is Aware of all things .
And when thy Lord said unto the angels : Lo ! I am about to place in the earth a viceroy , they said : Wilt Thou place therein one who will do corruption therein and shed blood , while we , hymn Thy praise and glorify Thee ?
He said , “ I know what you do not know . ”
And He brought Adam the names , all of them , then presented them to the angels , and said , “ Call me the names of these , if you are truthful . ”
They said : Glory be to Thee ! we have no knowledge save that which Thou hast taught us ; surely Thou art the Knower , the Wise .
He said , “ O Adam , tell them their names . ”
And when he had named them their names He said : Did I not say that I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth , and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal ?
And when We said to the angels , &apos; Bow yourselves to Adam &apos; ; so they bowed themselves , save Iblis ; he refused , and waxed proud , and become one of the unbelievers .
And We said : O Adam ! dwell thou and thine spouse in the Garden , and eat ye twain plenteously thereof as ye list , but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrong-doers .
But Satan caused them to slip therefrom and brought them out of that in which they were ; and We said , &apos; Get you down , you two !
And We said : get ye down , one of you an enemy unto anot her , and for you on the earth shall be a habitation and provision for a season .
Then Adam learnt from his Lord certain words ( of revelation ) , so He forgave him . Verily , He is the Oft-Forgiving , the Most Merciful .
We said , “ Go down from here , all of you . ”
But when My guidance comes to you , those who follow My guidance will have no fear , nor will they grieve .
But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations , such are rightful owners of the Fire ; they will abide therein .
O Children of Israel ! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you , and fulfil My covenant , and I shall fulfil My covenant unto you .
So be wary of Me &#91; alone &#93; .
And believe in that which I have sent down confirming that which is with you , and be not the first to disbelieve therein , and barter not My revelations for a small price , and Me alone shall ye fear .
And do not conceal the truth among yourselves , and do not conceal the truth while you know &#91; it &#93; .
And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and bow down with those who have sense .
Do you command people to maintain justice , and forget yourselves , while you recite the Scripture ?
Do you not exercise your reason ?
And seek help through patience and prayer ; indeed , it is difficult except for the humbly submissive &#91; to Allah &#93;
who know that they will meet their Lord and that to Him they will return .
O Children of Israel , remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I have preferred you over all the worlds .
And fear the Day when no soul will avail another soul in the least , nor will any intercession be accepted from it , nor will they be helped .
And remember that We saved you from the people of Pharaoh , who afflicted you with the worst torment , slaughtering your sons and sparing your women ; and in that was a great trial from your Lord .
Remember that We divided the sea for you and saved you , but We drowned the people of Pharaoh before your eyes .
Remember that We appointed for Moses forty nights , and in his absence you took to worshiping the calf , and thus committing injustice .
Then We pardoned you ; haply you will be thankful .
Remember that We gave Moses the Book , and the Criterion , so that you might be guided .
And recall what time Musa said unto his people : my people ! verily ye have wronged yourselves by your taking the calf , wherefore turn penitently unto your Maker , and slay yourselves .
Then He turned to you ( in forgiveness ) : for He is Oft-Forgiving , Most Merciful . &quot;
And when you said : O Musa ! we will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly , so the thunderbolt took you while you looked on .
Then We raised you up after your death , so that you might give thanks .
And We shaded you with clouds , and We sent down to you manna and quails , &#91; saying &#93; , &quot; Eat from the good things with which We have provided you , &quot; but they did not harm Us , but they harmed themselves .
And recall what time We said : enter this township and eat plenteously therefrom as ye list , and enter the gate prostrating , and say : forgiveness ; We will forgive you your trespasses .
We shall forgive you your sins and shall bestow further favours on those who do good . &quot;
But the wrongdoers changed the saying with other than what they were told , so We sent down upon the wrongdoers a plague from the sky , because of the transgressions they used to commit .
And when Moses prayed for water for his people , We said : Strike the rock with thy staff , and there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs .
Each tribe knew its drinking-place . Eat and drink of that which Allah hath provided , and commit no mischief on the earth .
And when you said : O Musa ! we cannot endure one kind of food , therefore call on your Lord to bring forth for us of what the earth grows , of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions ; he said : What ! will you exchange that which is meaner for what is better ?
Go down to any town and you will get what you ask for . &quot;
That was because they disbelieved in the Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) of Allah and killed the Prophets without right . That was because they disobeyed and transgressed .
Lo ! those who believe , and those who are Jews , and Christians , and Sabaeans - whosoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right , their reward is with their Lord , and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve .
And when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you , ( saying ) : Hold fast to that which We have given you , and remember that which is therein , that haply ye may ward off ( evil ) .
Then you turned away . Had it not been for the grace of God and His mercy upon you , you would surely have been among the losers .
And certainly you know those of you who violated the Sabbath , so We said to them : Be ( as ) apes , despised and hated .
And We made it an example to the former times and a lesson for the righteous .
And when Musa said to his people : Surely Allah commands you to slaughter a cow , they said : Are you making fun of us ?
He said , “ God forbid that I should be so ignorant . ”
They said : Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what ( cow ) she is .
He said , “ He says she is a heifer , neither too old , nor too young , but in between .
So do what you are commanded . &quot;
They said : Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what colour she should be .
He said , “ He says she is a yellow heifer , of bright colour , pleasing to the beholders . ”
They said : Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what ( cow ) she is .
To us all cows are alike . If God wills , we shall be guided . &quot;
He said , &apos; He says she shall be a cow not broken to plough the earth or to irrigate the tillage , one that ploughs not any thing . &apos;
They said , &apos; Now thou hast brought the truth &apos; ; and so they sacrificed her , though they had not done so .
And recall what time ye slew a person among yourselves and then disputed respecting it , when Allah was to bring to light that which ye were wont to hide .
So We said : &quot; Strike the ( body ) with a piece of it . &quot;
Thus God brings the dead to life , and shows you His signs ; haply you will understand .
Then your hearts hardened thereafter , so that they were as stones or even harder ; verily of stones there are some from which gush forth rivers ; and of them are some that cleave asunder and water issueth therefrom .
And there are some of them who fall down in awe of Allah , and Allah is not unaware of what you do .
Do you then hope that they will believe in you when some of them have already heard the Word of Allah and then they would changed it after they had understood it ?
And when they meet those who believe , they say : We believe ; and when they are alone one with another they say : Do you speak to them of what Allah has revealed to you that they may contend with you about it before your Lord ?
Do you not exercise your reason ? &quot;
And when they know not that Allah knoweth what they conceal and what they reveal .
And among them are unlettered ones who know not the Book , but vain desires ; and they do but guess .
So woe to those who write the Book with their hands , and then say , &apos; This is from God , &apos; that they may sell it for a little price ; so woe to them for what their hands have written , and woe to them for what they have been earning .
And they say , “ The Fire will not touch us , except for a number of days . ”
Say : Have you received a promise from Allah ?
Say , “ Have you received a promise from God — God never breaks His promise — or are you saying about God what you do not know ? ”
Yea ! whosoever earnoth vice and his sin hath encompassed him , those shall be the fellows of the Fire ; therein they shall be abiders .
But those who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise ; they will abide therein eternally .
And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel , ( saying ) : Worship none but Allah and be good to parents and to kindred and to orphans and the needy , and speak kindly to men and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate , except a few of you turn away .
And when We made a covenant with you : You shall not shed your blood or turn yourselves out of your dwellings , and you shall say , and you bear witness .
Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of you from their homes , and transgress against them in sin and transgression .
And if they come to you as captives , you ransom them , although their expulsion was forbidden you .
Do you believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve another part ?
What shall be the recompense of those of you who do that except disgrace in this world , and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be sent back to the severest of punishment , and Allah is not heedless of what you do .
These are they who have purchased the life of this world for the Hereafter ; wherefore the torment shall not be lightened for them , nor shall they be succoured .
Certainly We gave Moses the Book and followed him with the apostles , and We gave Jesus , the son of Mary , manifest proofs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit .
But whenever a Messenger comes to you with that which does not suit your fancies you grew arrogant , calling some liars , and some you killed .
And they say : Our hearts are hardened .
Allah has cursed them because of their disbelief , so little is that which they believe .
And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which is with them - although before that they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but when there came to them that which they recognized , they disbelieved in it .
So God ’ s curse is upon the disbelievers .
Evil is that for which they sell their souls , and disbelieve in that which Allah has sent down , grudging that Allah should send down of His bounty upon whom He wills of His servants .
So they have incurred wrath upon wrath . For the unbelievers there is a humiliating punishment .
When it is said to them , “ Believe in what God has revealed , ” they say , “ We believe in what was revealed to us , ” and they reject what has been sent down after it , though it is the truth confirming what is with them .
Say : Why then did you kill the prophets of Allah before , if you are believers ?
And Moses came unto you with clear proofs ( of Allah &apos;s Sovereignty ) , yet ye chose the calf ( for worship ) after him , and ye were wrong-doers .
And when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you ( saying ) : Hold fast that which We have given you , and hear , they say : We hear and we disobey .
And they were made to sink into their hearts with the calf because of their disbelief .
Say : Evil is that which your faith enjoineth on you , if ye are believers .
Say : If the abode of the Hereafter is with Allah only for you and not for others of mankind , then long for death if you are truthful .
But they will never long for it , because of what their hands have sent ahead , and Allah knows best the wrongdoers .
And thou wilt find them the greediest of mankind for life , of all things , nigher than the idolaters .
Each one of them would fain life for a thousand years , but such a long life would not save him from the torment , and Allah is the Beholder of that which they work .
Say , “ Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel — he has brought it down to your heart with God ’ s revelations , confirming what preceded it , and guidance and good news for the believers . ”
Whoever is an enemy to God , His angels , His messengers , Gabriel , and Michael — God is an enemy to the disbelievers . ”
And indeed We have sent down to you clear Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) , and none deny them but the Fasiqun ( rebellious , disobedient to Allah ) .
Is it not ( the case ) that whenever they make a covenant , a party of them throw it aside ? Most of them do not believe .
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah confirming what was with them , a party of them threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know .
And they followed what the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon . Solomon disbelieved not , but the devils disbelieved , teaching the people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babylon , Harut and Marut , but the two ( angels ) never taught anyone ( such things ) till they had said , &quot; We are only for trial , so do not believe . &quot;
And from these two ( angles ) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife .
But they did not harm anyone except with Allah &apos;s authority .
And they learn what harms them and does not benefit them .
And certainly they know that whoever purchased it shall have no portion in the hereafter ; surely evil is that for which they have sold their souls , if they but knew !
And if they had believed and feared Allah , then the reward from Allah would have been better , if they only knew .
O you who believe ! do not say Raina , and say Unzurna and listen , and for the unbelievers there is a painful chastisement .
Those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture ( Jews and Christians ) and Al-Mushrikun ( the disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah , idolaters , polytheists , pagans , idolaters , etc . ) like that any good should be sent down unto you from your Lord , but Allah chooses for His Mercy whom He will , and Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding .
When We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten , We bring one better than it , or one similar to it .
Do you not know that Allah has power over all things ?
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth , and besides Allah you have no guardian or helper ?
Or do you want to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before ?
And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way .
Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed , out of envy from themselves , after the truth has become manifest to them .
But pardon and overlook , until God brings His command ; surely God is powerful over everything .
And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and whatever good you send before for yourselves , you shall find it with Allah .
Indeed , Allah is Seeing of what you do .
And they say , “ None will enter Paradise unless he is a Jew or a Christian ” ; these are their own wishful fancies .
Say : Bring your proof if you are truthful .
And whoever submits his face ( himself ) to Allah ( i.e. follows Allah &apos;s Religion of Islamic Monotheism ) and he is a Muhsin ( good-doer - see V. 2 : 2 ) , his reward is with his Lord ( i.e. Paradise ) , on such shall be no fear , nor shall they grieve .
And the Jews say : The Nazarenes are not grounded on aught ; and the Nazarenes say : the Jews are not grounded on aught ; and they both recite the Book even so saying the men of knowledge not .
Then Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ .
And who is more unjust than he who prevents ( men ) from the masjids of Allah , that His name may be remembered in them , and that he may not enter them except in fear ?
For them there is disgrace in this world , and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment .
And to Allah belong the east and the west ; so wherever you turn , there is the face of Allah , surely Allah is Ample-giving , Knowing .
And they say : Allah hath taken unto Himself a son .
Glory be to Him !
Lo ! verily His is whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth ; all are unto Him devoutly obedient .
The Originator of the heavens and the earth ; when He decrees a thing , He only says to it , &quot; Be , &quot; and it is .
And those who have no knowledge say : Why does not Allah speak to us and not bring to us a sign ?
So said the people before them words of similar import ; their hearts are alike .
We have certainly made the signs clear for a people who are certain &#91; in faith &#93; .
We have sent you with the truth , a bearer of good news and a warner , and you are not responsible for the inmates of Hell .
Never will the Jews be pleased with you , nor the Christians , unless you follow their creed .
Say : &apos; God &apos;s guidance is the true guidance ; and if thou followest their caprices , after the knowledge that has come to thee , thou shalt have against God neither protector nor helper . &apos;
Those to whom We have given the Book recite it as it ought to be followed -- those believe in it ; those who disbelieve in it -- they are the losers .
O Children of Israel , remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I have preferred you over the worlds .
And fear the Day when no soul will avail another soul in the least , and no ransom will be accepted from it , nor will any intercession benefit it , nor will they be helped .
And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain words , and he fulfilled them , He said , “ I will make you a leader of humanity . ”
Said Abraham , &apos; And of my seed ? &apos; He said , &apos; My covenant shall not reach the evildoers . &apos;
And when We made the House ( the Ka &apos;bah ) a visitation for mankind and a sanctuary , ( saying ) : Take the place where Abraham stood ( for prayer ) ; and We covenanted with Abraham and Isma &apos;il ( Ishmael ) , that they should sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it ( the Ka &apos;bah ) , and those who stay in it for devotion , and those who bow down and prostrate themselves ( in worship ) .
And when Abraham said , &apos; My Lord , make this a secure sanctuary , and give to such of them as believe in God and the Last Day , He said , &apos; And whoso disbelieves , I shall give him enjoyment for a little ; then I shall give him enjoyment of the chastisement of the Fire , and evil is the homecoming . &apos;
And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House , he said , &apos; Our Lord , receive this from us ; Thou art the All-hearing , the All-knowing .
And make us submissive unto Thee , and of our seed a nation submissive unto Thee .
And show us Your worship , and turn towards us ; indeed You only are the Most Acceptor of Repentance , the Most Merciful . ”
“ Our Lord ! And raise up a Noble Messenger from among them , who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom , and purify them ; indeed You only are the Almighty , the Wise . ”
And who turns away from the religion of Abraham , except he who fools himself ?
And assuredly We chose him in the world , and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous .
When his Lord said to him , “ Pray to you ” , he said , “ I have submitted to the Lord Of The Creation . ”
And Abraham instructed his sons to do this and so did Jacob , &#91; saying &#93; , &quot; O my sons , indeed Allah has chosen for you the religion , so do not die except as Muslims . &quot;
Were you witnesses when death approached Jacob , and he said to his sons , “ What will you worship , if I am prevented ? ” They said , “ We worship your God , the God of your forefathers , Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , the One God ; and to Him we have submitted . ”
That was a nation that has passed ; for them is what they have earned , and for you is what you have earned .
And you will not be asked about what they used to do .
And they say , &quot; Be Jews or Christians , then you will be &#91; rightly &#93; guided . &quot;
Say , ‘ Yes !
The religion of Abraham , the upright , who was not one of the idolaters . &apos;
Say , &quot; We believe in God and what has been revealed to us , and in what was revealed to Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob and the Tribes , and in what was given to Moses , Jesus , and the prophets from their Lord .
We make no distinction between any of them , and to Him we have submitted . &quot;
So if they believe in the like of that which ye believe , then they are rightly guided ; but if they turn away , then they are in schism ; but Allah will suffice thee as against them , and He is the Hearer , the Knower .
This is the way of God . And who is better in his position than God ?
And to Him do we worship . &quot;
Say : Do you dispute with us about Allah , and He is our Lord and your Lord ?
And we have our deeds , and you have your deeds , and to Him we are sincere .
Or do you say that Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , and the Tribes were Jews or Christians ? &apos;
Say : Do you know better , or does Allah ?
And who is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony that he has from Allah ?
And Allah is not unaware of what you do .
That was a nation that has passed ; for them is what they have earned , and for you is what you have earned .
And you will not be asked about what they used to do .
The foolish among the people will say , ‘ What has turned them away from the Quran , while they were turning away from it before ? ’
Say : To Allah belong the East and the West ; He guides whom He pleases to the right path .
Thus We have made you a middle nation , that you may be witnesses over the people , and that the Messenger may be a witness for you .
And We did not appoint the Qur ’ an which you were before except in order that We may distinguish him who follows the Noble Messenger from him who turns back upon his heels ; and indeed it was a hard task except for those whom Allah guided .
And Allah is not one to let your religion go astray ; verily Allah is unto mankind Tender , Merciful .
We certainly see you turning your face about in the sky , and We will surely turn you to a Quran that will please you .
So turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque , and wherever you are , turn your faces toward it .
Those who have been given the Book know it is the truth from their Lord ; and God is not heedless of the things they do .
Even if you bring those who were given the Book every &#91; kind of &#93; sign , they will not follow your qiblah , nor will you follow their qiblah , nor will any of them adopt the qiblah of the other .
If thou followest their caprices , after the knowledge that has come to thee , then thou wilt surely be among the evildoers .
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own sons , and to hide the truth from them .
This is the truth from your Lord , so do not be among the doubters .
Everyone has a direction towards which he turns .
Wherever you are , Allah will bring you all together . Indeed , Allah is over all things competent .
And from whencesoever thou goest forth , turn thy face toward the Sacred Mosque , and verily it is the truth from thy Lord .
And Allah is not unaware of what you do .
And wherever you come from , turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque ; and wherever you are , turn your faces towards it , so that people may not have any argument against you , except those of them that are wrongdoers ; so do not fear them , but fear Me .
and that I may perfect My blessing upon you , and that you may be guided . &apos;
And how We have sent among you a Messenger from among you , reciting to you Our verses and purifying you and teaching you the Book and wisdom and teaching you that which you did not know .
So remember Me , that I may remember you . And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me .
O you who believe ! seek help in patience and prayer ; surely Allah is with the patient .
And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah : dead ; they are alive , but ye perceive not .
And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger , and loss of wealth and lives and fruits ; but give good tidings to the patient ,
who , when affliction visits them , say , &apos; Surely we belong to God , and to Him we are turning . &apos;
Those are the ones upon whom their Lord will have blessings and mercy , and it is they who are the &#91; rightly &#93; guided .
Safa and Marwa are among the waymarks of God ; so whosoever makes the Pilgrimage to the House , or the Visitation , it is no fault in him to circumambulate between them ; and whosoever volunteers good , God is All-thankful , All-knowing .
Those who conceal what We have revealed of clear proofs and guidance , after We have clarified them in the Book for mankind — God cursed them in the Book , and the curse of those who curse .
Except those who repent and amend and make manifest ( the truth ) , these it is to whom I turn ( mercifully ) ; surely I am the Oft-returning ( to mercy ) , the Merciful .
Lo ! those who disbelieve and die in their disbelief , on them is the curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined .
Abiding in it ; their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be respited .
Your God is One God ; there is no god but He , the All-compassionate , the All-compassionate .
Verily , in the creation of the heavens and the earth , and in the alternation of the night and the day , and in the ships that sail through the sea with that which benefits mankind , and in the water ( rain ) which Allah has sent down from the sky , and with it revives the earth after its death , and the moving ( living ) creatures of all kinds that He has scattered therein , and the veering of the winds and the clouds made subservient between heaven and earth are signs for a people who understand .
Yet there are some who set up compeers apart from God , loving God as God should be loved .
And those who believe love Allah more , and when those who do wrong behold the doom , that all power belongeth wholly to Allah , and that Allah is severe in requiting ( evil ) .
When those who were followed disown those who followed ( them ) , and they behold the doom , and the last remnant was cut off from them .
And those who followed will say , &quot; If only we could return &#91; to the worldly life &#93; , we would disown them as they disown us . &quot;
Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets to them , and they will not emerge from the Fire .
O mankind ! Eat of that which is lawful and clean in the earth , and follow not the footsteps of the Satan ; verily he is Unto you an enemy manifest .
He only prompts you to evil and indecency , and that you say about God what you do not know .
And when it is said to them , &quot; Follow what Allah has revealed , &quot; they say , &quot; We will follow that upon which we found our fathers , &quot; even if their fathers were not understanding and were not guided .
The likeness of those who disbelieve is as the likeness of one who shouts to that which hears nothing except a shout and a voice .
They are deaf , dumb , blind , so they do not understand .
O you who believe ! Eat of the good things with which We have provided you , and give thanks to Allah , if it is He Whom you serve .
He has forbidden you only carrion , blood , the flesh of swine , what has been hallowed to other than Allah .
But if one is forced by necessity , without wilful disobedience , nor transgressing due limits , - then is he to whom Allah is Oft-forgiving , Most Merciful .
Those who conceal what Allah has revealed of the Book and sell it for a small price , they eat nothing but fire into their bellies , and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection , nor will He purify them , and for them is a painful punishment .
They are the ones who bought error for guidance , and punishment for forgiveness : how patient of them to face the Fire !
That is because Allah has revealed the Book with the truth , and indeed those who dispute about the Book are in extreme defiance .
Righteousness is not whether you face towards the East or the West ; but righteousness is this that one should believe in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the Prophets and and give away wealth , out of love for Him to relatives and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and for the beggars and for ( the emancipation of ) the captives , and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and those who keep their promise when they make a promise , and the patient in distress and adversity and adversity and adversity and adversity and in time of conflict ; these are they who are true ( to themselves ) and these it is they who guard ( against evil ) .
O ye who believe ! the law of equality is prescribed for you in cases of murder : the free for the free , the slave for the slave , the female for the female .
But if any remission is made by his brother , then grant any reasonable demand , and compensate him with handsome gratitude .
This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord .
So whoever transgresses thereafter , for him is a painful punishment .
And there is life for you in retaliation , O men of understanding .
It is expected that you will fear God .
It is prescribed for you that when death approaches one of you , if he leaves wealth , he shall make a bequest for his parents and relatives in an honourable manner .
This is an obligation on the righteous .
Then whoever changes it after he has heard it , the sin shall be on those who alter it ; surely Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
But if one fears from the testator some unjust act or wrong-doing , and makes peace between the parties , there shall be no sin on him ; surely God is All-forgiving , All-compassionate .
O you who believe ! fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you , that you may guard ( against evil ) .
For a certain number of days ; but whoever among you is sick or on a journey , then ( he shall fast ) a ( like ) number of other days ; and those who are able to fast ( it ) shall fast a ransom the feeding of a needy person .
But he who does good of his own accord shall be better for him .
But to fast is better for you , if only you knew .
The month of Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed ; a guidance for mankind and clear proofs of the guidance and the distinction ; so whoever of you is present in the month , let him fast .
And whoever is ill or on a journey , then ( let him fast ) a number of other days ; Allah desires ease for you , He does not desire that you should complete the term , and that you may magnify Allah that He has guided you , in order that you may give thanks .
And when My servants ask you about Me , then surely I am very near ; I answer the call of the caller when he calls on Me .
So let them respond to Me and believe in Me ; perhaps they will be &#91; rightly &#93; guided .
It is lawful for you to have carnal relations with your wives on the night of the fast . They are the same for you to have rest and to protect you from them .
Allah knows that you have been defrauding yourselves , so He has turned to you clemently , and pardoned you .
So now consort with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you .
Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black .
It is not lawful to have carnal relations with your wives during i &apos;tikaf in the mosque in the mosques of Allah , so do not approach them .
Thus does Allah make clear His Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqun ( the pious - see V. 2 : 2 ) .
And do not swallow up your property among yourselves unjustly , and do not proffer it to the property of men , that you may wrongfully devour a part of the property of men , while you know .
They ask you about the phases of the moon .
Say : &apos; They are times fixed for people and for the pilgrimage . &apos;
And it is not righteousness that you enter houses from their backs , but righteousness is &#91; in &#93; one who fears Allah .
Enter houses through their proper doors and fear God .
You may well be successful .
And fight in the way of Allah with those who fight against you , but do not transgress ; surely Allah does not love the transgressors .
And kill them wherever you overtake them , and expel them from where they have expelled you ; and persecution is worse than killing .
And do not fight them near the Sacred Mosque until they fight you there .
But if they fight you , then slay them ; such is the recompense of the unbelievers .
But if they cease , then Allah is indeed all-forgiving , all-merciful .
Fight them until persecution is no more , and religion is for Allah .
Then if they desist , there shall be no violence save against the wrong-doers .
The sacred month is for the sacred month , and for the sacred month ; and whoever acts hostile to you , then he oppressed the like of it , and be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah , and know that Allah is with those who guard ( against evil ) .
Spend in the way of Allah and do not cast yourselves with your own hands into ruin , and be virtuous .
Verily , Allah loves Al-Muhsinun ( the good-doers - see V. 2 : 112 ) .
Complete the hajj and the ‘ umrah for Allah ’ s sake .
But if you are prevented ( from completing it ) , then offer whatever offering you can afford , and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination .
But if any of you is ill , or has an ailment of his head , then redemption by fasting or charity , or offer sacrifice , or offer sacrifice .
And when you are secure , then whoever performs &apos; Umrah in the Hajj &#91; pilgrimage &#93; &apos; umrah &#91; during the Hajj season &#93; , then &#91; offer &#93; what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals .
Anyone who lacks the means must fast for three days during the Hajj and seven when you return , ten days in all .
That is for him whose family is not present at the Holy Mosque .
And fear Allah , and know that Allah is severe in penalty .
The months of Hajj are well known to all ; whoever makes up his mind to perform Hajj during these fixed months , let him totally abstain from all sorts of sexual indulgence , wickedness or sin , or wrangling during the Hajj .
Whatever good you do , God knows it .
And take provision for the journey ; but the best provision is godfearing .
So fear Me , O you who possess intellect !
There is no fault in you if you seek the bounty of your Lord .
Then when ye hurry from Arafat , remember Allah at the Sacred Mosque , and remember Him as He hath guided you , though afore ye were of the erring ones .
Then surge on from where the people return from , and ask God for forgiveness .
Lo ! Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And when you have completed your rites , then remember Allah as you remember your forefathers or with &#91; greater &#93; greater remembrance .
Among the people there are those who say , ‘ Our Lord , give us good in this world , ’ and they have no share in the Hereafter .
And among them is he who says , “ Our Lord ! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter , and save us from the punishment of the Fire . ”
These will have a share of what they have earned , and Allah is swift at reckoning .
And remember Allah during the numbered days . Then whosoever hastens off in two days , there is no sin on him , and whosoever delayeth , on him there is no sin for him ; verily he is God-fearing .
And fear Allah , and know that you will be brought back to Him .
And among men there is he whose speech about this world pleases you , and he calls Allah to witness as to what is in his heart , and he is the most contentious of the adversaries .
When he turns away , he hastens about the earth to do corruption there and destroy the tillage and the stock ; and God loves not corruption ;
And when it is said to him , “ Fear Allah ” , he becomes more resolute in committing sin – therefore hell is sufficient for him ; and what a wretched resting place !
And among men is he who sells himself seeking the pleasure of Allah , and Allah is most kind to &#91; His &#93; servants .
O ye who believe !
Enter into peace , all together , and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan . He is your manifest enemy .
And if ye slip after the clear proofs have come unto you , then know that Allah is Mighty , Wise .
Are they waiting for God to come down to them in the shadows of the clouds , with the angels , and so the matter is settled ?
And to Allah will be returned &#91; all &#93; matters .
Ask the Children of Israel how many a clear sign We have given them .
And whoever changes the favor of Allah after it has come to him - then indeed , Allah is severe in penalty .
Beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve , and they ridicule those who believe .
But those who are Godwary will be above them on the Day of Resurrection , and Allah provides for whomever He wishes without any measure .
Mankind was one nation ; then God sent the Prophets , good tidings to bear , and warning ; and He sent down with them the Book with the truth , that He might judge between the people touching that whereon they were at variance ; and none but those who were given it , after the clear signs had come to them , being insolent one to another , by His leave ; and God guides whomsoever He will to the truth , touching which they were at variance ; and God guides whomsoever He will to a straight path .
Or do you think that you will enter Paradise without such ( trials ) as came to those who passed away before you ?
Affliction and adversity befell them and they were shaken until the apostle and those who believed with him said : When will the help of Allah come ?
Now surely the help of Allah is nigh .
They ask you what they should spend ( in charity ) .
Say : Whatever wealth you spend , it is for parents and near kindred and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer , and whatever good you do , surely Allah knows it well .
Fighting is ordained for you , even if you dislike it .
Yet it may be that you dislike something , which is good for you , and it may be that you love a thing which is bad for you .
And Allah knoweth , and ye know not .
They ask you about fighting in the sacred month .
Say , &quot; Fighting therein is great sin .
But to bar others from God &apos;s way , and disbelieve in Him , and to the Holy Mosque , and to expel its inhabitants from it is greater with God ; and persecution is more heinous than slaying . &apos;
And they will not cease to fight you until they turn you away from your religion , if they are able .
But whoever of you turns back from his faith and dies faithless — these are the ones whose works have failed in this world and the Hereafter .
They shall be the inmates of the Fire , and they shall remain in it &#91; forever &#93; .
Verily those who believe and have emigrated and striven hard in the way of Allah , those shall hope for the mercy of Allah , and Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
They ask you about intoxicants and gambling .
Say : &quot; In them is great sin , and ( some ) benefit for men , but their profit is greater than their benefit . &quot;
And they ask you what they should spend .
Say , &quot; The excess &#91; beyond needs &#93; . &quot;
Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you so that you may give thought .
On this world and the hereafter . They ask you concerning orphans Say : To set right for them is that ; and if you mix your affairs with theirs , they are your brethren ; and Allah knows the mischief-makers from him who means good , and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have brought you into a difficulty ; surely Allah is Mighty , Wise .
And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe .
A believing slave woman is better than an idolatress , though she should impress you .
And do not marry &#91; your daughters &#93; to idolaters until they believe .
A believing slave is better than an idolater , even though he may please you .
Those call to the Fire , but God calls to Paradise and pardon , by His leave , and He makes His signs clear to the people ; haply they will remember Him .
And they ask you about menstruation .
Say , “ It is hurtful .
So keep away from women during menstruation , and do not approach them until they are clean . When they have cleansed themselves , then approach them as God has commanded you .
God loves those who turn to Him in repentance and He loves those who purify themselves . &quot;
Your wives are as fields for you , so come into your fields as you will , and send &#91; good &#93; beforehand for yourselves .
And fear Allah , and know that you will meet Him .
( Muhammad ) , give the glad news ( of God &apos;s mercy ) to the believers .
And make not Allah &apos;s ( name ) an excuse in your oaths against doing good and acting rightly , and making peace among men ; and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Allah will not take you to task for the vain in your oaths , but He will take you to task for that which your hearts have earned , and Allah is Forgiving , Forbearing .
Those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives must wait four months ; so if they wish to renounce their oaths , Allah is Oft Forgiving , Most Merciful .
And if they resolve on divorce , then verily Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Divorced women should wait for three periods , and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day .
And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period , if they desire a reconciliation .
Women have rights similar to their obligations , according to what is fair , and men have a degree above them .
And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise .
Divorce is twice , then an honourable retention or setting free kindly .
And it is not lawful for you to take back anything of what you have given them , unless both fear that they will not be able to keep &#91; within &#93; the limits of Allah .
And if ye fear that they shall not be able to keep the limits of Allah , then it is no sin for either of them if they ransom themselves thereby .
These are the limits of Allah , so do not transgress them , and whoever transgresses the limits of Allah - it is those who are the wrongdoers .
And if he divorces her , then she is not lawful to him thereafter until she marries another husband .
If the latter divorces her , there is no blame on either of them if they return to each other , provided they think that they can keep God &apos;s bounds ; and these are the limits of God , which He makes clear for those who know .
And when you divorce women and they have &#91; nearly &#93; fulfilled their term , either retain them according to acceptable terms or release them according to acceptable terms , and do not keep them , intending harm , to transgress &#91; against them &#93; .
Whoever does that has wronged himself .
Do not make a mockery of God &apos;s revelations . Remember the favor of God which He has bestowed upon you , and what He revealed to you of the Book and Wisdom to exhort you .
And fear Allah and know that Allah is Knowing of all things .
When you divorce women , and they fulfil their term , do not prevent them from marrying their husbands , if they agree on reasonable basis .
This is an admonition for those of you who believe in Allah and the Last Day .
That is better for you and purer , and Allah knows and you do not know .
It is for the father to provide for them and clothe them with kindness , no soul shall be burdened beyond its capacity .
A mother shall not be harmed because of her child , nor shall he to whom the child is born because of his child .
If the couple desire weaning , by mutual consent and consultation , they commit no error by doing so .
And if you desire a wet nurse for your children , it is no fault in you provide you hand over what you have given honourably .
And fear God , and know that God sees the things you do .
And those of you who die leaving wives behind them , they ( the wives ) shall wait ( as regards their marriage ) for four months and ten days , then when they have fulfilled their term , there is no blame on you for what they do of themselves in an honourable manner , and Allah is with what you do .
And there is no sin on you if you make a hint of betrothal or conceal it in your hearts ; Allah knows that you will remember them , but do not make secret pacts with them except by decent words , and do not hold secret pacts with them until you reach the marriage tie , and know that Allah knows what is in your hearts , therefore beware of Him , and know that Allah is Forgiving , Forbearing .
There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before consummation or the fixation of their dower ; but bestow on them ( A suitable gift ) , the wealthy according to his means , and the poor according to his means , a fair provision .
( This is ) a duty incumbent on Al-Muhsinun ( good-doers - see V. 2 : 112 ) .
If you divorce them before you have touched them , but after you had given them a dowry , give them half of what you have settled , unless they forego the right , or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it .
And to forego and give ( her the full Mahr ) is nearer to piety .
And do not forget Liberality between yourselves ; indeed Allah is seeing your deeds .
Guard strictly ( five obligatory ) As-Salawat ( the prayers ) especially the middle Salat ( i.e. the best prayer - &apos; Asr ) , and stand up before Allah with obedience &#91; and do not speak to others during the Salat ( prayers ) &#93; .
But if you are in fear , then ( pray ) on foot or riding , and when you are safe , remember Allah , as He has taught you that which you did not know .
And those of you who die and leave wives behind , they should bequeath unto their wives a year &apos;s maintenance and they shall not be expelled .
But if they leave their homes of their own accord , you will not be blamed for what they may reasonably choose to do with themselves .
And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise .
Likewise , the divorced women should also be given something in accordance with honourable norms , a duty on the righteous .
Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you so that you may exercise your reason .
Have you not considered those who went forth from their homes in their thousands fearful of death , and God said to them , &apos; Die ! &apos;
Then He gave them life ; surely God is bountiful to men , but most men are not thankful .
And fight in the way of Allah , and know that Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Who is he that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan , so that He may multiply it unto him manifold ?
Allah straiteneth and increaseth ; and unto Him ye will be returned .
Have you not considered the notables of the Children of Israel after Moses , when they said to a prophet of theirs , ‘ Appoint for us a king that we may fight in the way of Allah . ’
He said , &quot; Is it not possible that if fighting was prescribed for you , you would not fight ? &quot;
They said : &quot; Why should we not fight in the cause of Allah , when we have been driven out of our homes and our children ( families have been taken as captives ) ? &quot;
But when fighting was ordained for them , they turned away , except for a few of them ; and Allah knows the unjust .
And their Prophet said to them , “ Indeed Allah has appointed Talut ( Saul ) as your king ” ; they said , “ How can he have kingship over us whereas we are more worthy of kingship than he , and he has not been given enough wealth ? ” He said , “ Indeed Allah has chosen him above you , and has bestowed him with vast knowledge and physique ” ; and Allah may bestow His kingdom on whomever He wills ; and Allah is Most Capable , All Knowing . ”
And their Prophet said to them , “ The sign of his kingship is that the Ark will be restored to you ; in it will be tranquillity from your Lord , and the relics left by the House of Moses and the House of Aaron ; and it will be carried by the angels .
Surely in that is a sign for you , if you are believers . &apos;
And when Saul went forth with the hosts , he said : Surely Allah will try you by a river .
Whoever drinks from it is not of me , and whoever does not taste it is indeed of me , except one who takes &#91; thereof &#93; from his hand . &quot;
But they drank thereof , all save a few of them .
And when he had crossed it , he and those who believed with him , they said : We have no power today against Goliath and his hosts .
But those who knew that they would meet Allah said , &quot; How often has a small party vanquished a large group by permission of Allah .
And Allah is with the patient . &quot;
And when they marched out against Goliath and his troops , they said , “ Our Lord , pour patience upon us , and strengthen our foothold , and help us against the disbelieving people . ”
Then they routed them by the leave of Allah , and David slew Goliath , and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom and taught him whatever He willed .
Had God not driven back the people , some by the means of others , the earth would have been filled with corruption .
But Allah is full of Kindness to ( His ) creatures .
These are the verses of Allah .
We recite them to you in truth , for you are truly one of the messengers .
These messengers : We gave some advantage over others .
Among them are some to whom Allah spoke , and some He raised in rank .
And if Allah had willed , those after them would not have fought one another after the clear proofs had come to them , but they differed .
Some of them believed , while others did not .
If Allah had so willed , they would not have fought against one another .
And Allah does what He wills .
O you who believe ! spend out of what We have given you before a day comes in which there is no bargaining , neither friendship nor intercession ; and the unbelievers are the unjust .
Allah , there is no deity except Him , the Living , the Everlasting .
Neither slumber nor sleep overtake Him .
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth ; who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission ?
He knows what is before them and what is behind them , and they do not understand anything of His knowledge except what He wills .
His Throne embraces the heavens and the earth , and He is not wearied by their preservation , and He is the All-high , the All-glorious .
There is no compulsion in religion .
The right way has become clearly distinct from the wrong path .
Therefore whoever disbelieves in the Shaitan and believes in Allah , he indeed has grasped the firmest handle , which shall never break ; and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Allah is the Guardian of those who believe ; He brings them out of the darkness into the light ; and ( as for ) those who disbelieve , their guardians are Shaitans ; they bring them forth from the light into the darkness ; they are the inmates of the fire , in it they shall abide .
Have you not considered him who argued with Abraham about his Lord , because God had given him the kingdom ?
When Abraham said , &quot; My Lord is He who gives life and causes death , &quot; he said , &quot; I give life and cause death . &quot;
Abraham said , “ God brings the sun from the East , so bring it from the West , ” so the blasphemer was confounded .
God does not guide the unjust people .
Or ( bethink thee of ) the like of him who , passing by a township which had fallen into ruin ?
Then he said : &quot; How will Allah bring this to life after its death ? &quot;
Then Allah brought him back to life for a hundred years , then resurrected him .
He said , “ How long have you remained ? ”
He said , &quot; I have remained a day or part of a day , &quot; and He said , &quot; Rather , you have remained &#91; in this state &#93; for a hundred years .
Now look at your food and your drink — it has not changed with ruin .
And look at your donkey ; and We will make you a sign for the people .
And look at the bones , how We shall raise them up and then clothe them with flesh &apos; And when it was made clear to him , he said , &apos; I know that God is powerful over everything . &apos;
And when Ibrahim said : My Lord ! show me how Thou givest life to the dead , He said : Dost thou not believe ?
He said , ‘ Yes !
But &#91; I ask &#93; , &quot; Rather , my heart will be at rest . &quot;
He said , “ Take four birds , and incline them to you , then place on each hill , then call them – then call them – they will come running towards you . ”
And know that Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise . &quot;
The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is as the parable of a grain that sprouts seven ears , in every ear a hundred grains .
And Allah multiplies &#91; His reward &#93; for whom He wills , and Allah is all-bounteous , all-knowing .
Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah , then do not follow up what they have spent with reproach or rebellion , their reward shall be theirs from their Lord , and they shall have no fear , nor shall they grieve .
Good words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by an evil deed . God is the kingdom , the Sublime .
O ye who believe ! cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury , like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men , but believe not in Allah and the Last Day .
The likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is dust ; a heavy rain falls on it , and leaves it bare .
They will not gain anything from their own deeds ; and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people .
And the parable of those who spend their wealth seeking Allah ’ s pleasure and to strengthen their souls is that of a garden on a hillside : a downpour strikes it , whereupon it brings forth its fruit twofold ; and if it does not fall , then light rain suffices .
And Allah is All-Seer of what you do .
Does one of you like that he should have a garden of palms and vines with streams flowing beneath it ; in it are all kinds of fruits for him ; and old age has stricken him and he has weak offspring , then a whirlwind with fire smites it , and it is consumed ?
This is how God explains to you His evidence so that perhaps you will take heed .
O ye who believe ! Spend of that which ye have earned and of that which We bring forth from the earth for you , and seek not the bad ( with intent ) that which ye spend ( in charity ) except with your eyes closed in on it ; and know that Allah is the dominion , and Glory be to Him !
Satan threatens you with poverty and bids you to immorality , while Allah promises you His forgiveness and bounty , and Allah is all-bounteous , all-knowing .
He gives wisdom to whom He wills , and whoever has been given wisdom , has been given wisdom , and those who possess intellect take admonition .
And whatever you spend or pledge to do , Allah knows it . And the wrongdoers do not find any helpers .
If you give charity openly , it is good ; and if you conceal it and give it to the poor , that is better for you and will atone for some of your misdeeds ; and Allah is Aware of what you do .
Their guidance is not your responsibility , but God guides whom He wills .
Whatever good you spend is for yourselves , and you do not spend except to seek Allah ’ s pleasure , and whatever good you spend shall be repaid to you in full , and you will not be wronged .
( Charity is ) for the poor who , in Allah &apos;s Cause , are restricted ( from travel ) , and cannot move about in the land ( for trade or work ) : the ignorant man thinks , because of their modesty , that they are free from want .
You will recognize them by their features ; they do not ask from people insistently .
And whatever good you spend , surely Allah knows it .
Those who spend their wealth by night and day , secretly and openly , they shall have their reward from their Lord , and they shall have no fear , nor shall they grieve .
Those who eat Riba ( usury ) shall not stand ( on the Day of Resurrection ) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitan ( Satan ) leading him to insanity .
That is because they say , &quot; Trade is &#91; just &#93; like interest . &quot;
But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden usury .
To whomsoever an admonition from his Lord comes , then he desists , he shall have what is past , and his affair is with Allah .
But whoever returns to &#91; dealing in interest or usury &#93; - those are the companions of the Fire ; they will abide therein eternally .
Allah effaces usury and nurtures charity , and Allah does not like any ungrateful , sinful person .
Indeed those who believed and did good deeds and kept the prayer established and paid the charity – their reward is from their Lord ; and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve .
O you who believe ! Be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah and relinquish what is ( due ) from usury , if you are believers .
And if you do not do it , then be informed of a war from Allah and His Messenger .
But if you repent , you will have your capital without being wronged or having done wrong to others .
And whoever is in hardship , let him give respite till ease ; and if you give charity , it is better for you if you only knew .
And fear the Day when you will be returned to Allah .
Then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned ; they shall not be wronged .
O you who believe ! When you contract a debt for a fixed time or a fixed term , write it down , and let a scribe write it down between you with fairness .
Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him , so let him write , and let the debtor dictate , and let him fear Allah , his Lord , and not diminish anything of it .
But if the debtor is a fool , or weak , or unable to dictate , then let his guardian dictate for him .
And call to witness two witnesses from among your men , and if there be not two men , then a man and two women from among those whom your right hands possess , so that if one of them errs , the other may remind her .
And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called , and do not disdain writing it down , be it small or large , until a stated term .
That is more just in the sight of Allah , more reliable as testimony , and more likely to prevent doubt between you , except when it is an immediate transaction between you , then there is no sin upon you if you do not write it down .
And take witnesses when you trade with one another , and let no harm be done to either scribe or witness .
And if ye do ( it ) , lo ! it is a sin in you .
Fear Allah , and Allah teaches you , and Allah is well aware of all things .
And if ye be on a journey and ye find not a scribe , then let there be a pledge taken ; then , if one of you entrusteth the other , let the one is entrusted discharge his trust , and let him fear Allah , his Lord , and diminish not testimony ; and whosoever hideth it , his heart is sinful , verily Allah is of that which ye work Aware .
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth , and whether you manifest what is in your hearts or conceal it , Allah will bring you to account for it ; then He will forgive whom He wishes and punish whom He wishes , and Allah has power over all things .
The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord , and so do the believers . Each one believes in God , His angels , His Books , and His messengers ; We make no distinction between any of His messengers .
And they say : We hear and obey ; Thy forgiveness , our Lord ! and Unto Thee is the return .
Allah does not charge a soul except &#91; with that within &#93; its capacity .
For it ( is only ) that which it hath earned , and against it ( only ) that which it hath earned ; Our Lord ! Condemn us not if we forget or make mistake .
Our Lord ! impose not on us a burden like that which Thou didst lay on those before us !
Our Lord , do not burden us with that which we have no strength to bear .
And pardon us , and forgive us , and have mercy on us .
You are our Protector , so help us against the people of the unbelievers . &apos;
Alif-Lam-Meem . ( Alphabets of the Arabic language – Allah , and to whomever He reveals , know their precise meanings . )
Allah — there is no god except Him — is the Living One , the All-sustainer .
He has revealed to you the Book with the truth , confirming what preceded it , and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel
before , as guidance for mankind , and He has sent down the Criterion &#91; to distinguish truth from falsehood &#93; .
Verily , those who disbelieve in the Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) of Allah , for them there is a severe torment , and Allah is All-Mighty , the Lord of Retribution .
Nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah .
It is He who forms you in the wombs as He wills .
There is no god but He , the Mighty , the Wise .
He it is Who has revealed to you the Book ; in it are verses basic or fundamental ( of established meaning ) , they are the foundation of the Book : others are allegorical : those in whose hearts there is perversity , follow the part of it which is allegorical , seeking to mislead and seeking to mislead ( their own ) interpretation , but none knows its ( true ) interpretation except Allah : But those firmly believe in them say , &quot; We believe in it , and none knows its ( meanings ) except Allah . &quot; But none are from our Lord , and none are men of understanding .
Our Lord ! Let not our hearts deviate after Thou hast guided us .
Grant us Your mercy ; You are the Giver . ”
Our Lord ! surely Thou art the Gathering day in which there is no doubt ; surely Allah will not fail His promise .
As for those who disbelieve , neither their riches nor their children shall avail them anything against Allah .
It is they who will be fuel for the Fire .
Like the behaviour of the people of Fir &apos;aun ( Pharaoh ) , and of those before them ; they rejected Our Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) , so Allah seized them for their sins , and Allah is Severe in punishment .
Say to those who disbelieve , “ You will be defeated , and rounded up into Hell — an evil resting-place . ”
There has certainly been a sign for you in the two hosts that met : one host fighting in the way of Allah and the other faithless , whom they saw with their eyes twice their &#91; own &#93; increase , and Allah strengthens with His help whomever He wishes .
There is indeed a lesson in that for those who have insight .
Beautified for mankind is the love of these desires – women , and sons , and heaps of gold and silver , and branded horses , and cattle and fields ; this is the wealth of the life of this world ; and with Allah is the best return .
Say : Shall I inform you of better than that ?
For the righteous , with their Lord , are Gardens beneath which rivers flow , wherein they will abide forever , and pure mates , and Allah ’ s pleasure .
And Allah is Seeing of &#91; His &#93; servants -
Those who say , &apos; Our Lord , we believe ; forgive us our sins , and guard us against the chastisement of the Fire &apos; ;
&#91; They are &#93; patient and truthful , and those who maintain the prayer and those who ask forgiveness at dawn .
God bears witness that there is no god but He , and the angels , and those possessed of knowledge , upholding justice .
There is no god but He , the Mighty , the Wise .
Indeed , the religion with Allah is Islam , and those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them , out of envy among themselves .
And whoever disbelieves in the signs of Allah , then indeed Allah is swift in &#91; taking &#93; account .
So if they dispute with thee , say : I have surrendered myself to Allah , and so have those who follow me .
And say to those who were given the Scripture , and to the unlearned , “ Have you surrendered ? ”
If they submit , they are rightly guided ; but if they turn away , your duty is only to convey the message .
And Allah is Seeing of &#91; His &#93; servants .
Lo ! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah and slay the prophets without justice , and slay those who do good works , give them tidings of a painful doom .
They are the ones whose works are in vain in this world and in the Hereafter , and they have no helpers .
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture ? They are invited to the Scripture of Allah that it may judge between them .
Then a party of them turn away , and they are backsliders .
That , because they say , &apos; The Fire shall not touch us , except for a number of days . &apos;
And that which they were wont to fabricate regarding their religion hath deluded them .
But how will it be &#91; with them &#93; when We gather them for a Day in which there is no doubt , and every soul will be recompensed fully for what it has earned , and they will not be wronged ?
Say : O Allah , Master of the Kingdom ! Thou givest the kingdom to whom Thou pleasest and takest off the kingdom from whom Thou pleasest , and Thou exaltest whom Thou pleasest and abasest whom Thou pleasest in Thine hand is all good .
In Your Hand is good . Indeed , You are over all things competent . &quot;
You cause the night to enter into the day , and the day to enter into the night ; and You bring the living out of the dead , and You bring the dead out of the living . And You provide for whomever You will without measure . &quot;
Let not the believers take the unbelievers for their friends , rather than the believers -- and whosoever does that , he shall have nothing to do with God , except fear of them .
And Allah warns you of Himself ; and to Allah is the &#91; final &#93; destination .
Say : Whether ye hide that which is in your breasts or disclose it , Allah knoweth it , He knoweth that which is in the heavens and that which is in the earth ; and Allah is Able to do all things .
On the Day when every soul will find itself confronted with all that it has done of good and all that it has done of evil , it will wish that there were a long space of time between it and that &#91; Day &#93; .
And Allah warns you of Himself ; and Allah is Kind to His servants .
Say : If you love Allah , follow me , Allah will love you and forgive you your sins ; surely Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
Say : Obey Allah and the Apostle ; but if they turn back , then surely Allah does not love the unbelievers .
Verily Allah chose Adam and Noah and the house of Abraham and the house of &apos; Imran above the worlds .
A generation from the other ; and Allah is All Hearing , All Knowing .
When the wife of Imran said , ‘ My Lord ! Indeed I vow to You what is in my womb , to be patient , so accept it from me ; indeed You are the All-hearing , the All-knowing . ’
And when she gave birth to her , she said , “ My Lord , I have delivered a female , ” and God knew very well what she had given birth to ; the male is not like the female .
&quot; And I have named her Maryam ( Mary ) , and I seek refuge with You ( Allah ) for her and for their offspring from Shaitan ( Satan ) , the outcast . &quot;
Wherefore Allah hath shown her favour and hath made her grow a goodly growth , and hath made grow unto the care of Zaqqum .
Whenever Zechariah visited her in the sanctuary , he found her with food , and said , ‘ O Mary , where did this come to you ? ’
She said , &quot; It is from Allah . Indeed , Allah gives provision to whom He wills . &quot;
Thereupon Zechariah prayed to his Lord , saying : &apos; Lord , grant me from Yourself a good offspring ; You are the Hearer of Prayers . &apos;
And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the prayer , saying : Surely Allah has mentioned to you , verifying a Word from Allah , noble , chaste , a prophet from among the good ones .
He said , “ My Lord , shall I have a son , when old age has overtaken me , and my wife is barren ? ”
He replied , &quot; God does as He wills . &quot;
He said , “ My Lord , give me a sign . ”
He said : Your sign is that you shall not speak to men for three days except by gestures , and remember your Lord much and glorify Him in the evening and in the morning .
And when the angels said : O Marium ! surely Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the world .
O Mary , be devoted to your Lord and prostrate and bow with those who are humble . &quot;
This is of the announcements relating to the unseen which We reveal to you ; and you were not with them when they cast their pens as to which of them should be the guardian of Marium ; and you were not with them when they disputed .
Recall what time the angels said : O Maryam ! verily Allah announceth unto thee a word from Him : his name is the Masih , Isa , son of Maryam , illustrious in the world and the Hereafter and one of those brought nigh .
And he will speak to the people in the cradle and in adulthood , and he will be one of the righteous . &quot;
She said , &quot; My Lord , how will I have a son when no man has touched me ? &quot;
He said : Allah creates what He pleases ; when He has decreed a matter He only says to it : Be , and it is .
And He will teach him the Book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel
And he will be sent to the Children of Israel ( saying ) : &quot; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord .
I will create for you out of clay the likeness of a bird , then I will breathe into it , by God ’ s leave . I will heal the blind and the leper , and bring the dead to life , by God ’ s leave , and I inform you of what you eat , and what you store in your houses .
Surely in that is a sign for you , if you are believers .
And I have come confirming the Taurat which was before me and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you ; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord , therefore fear Allah and obey me .
Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord , therefore serve Him ; this is the right path .
And when Jesus perceived their disbelief , he said , “ Who is my helper towards God ? ”
The disciples said : We are helpers ( in the cause ) of Allah ; we believe in Allah , and bear witness that we are Muslims .
Our Lord ! We believe in that which Thou hast revealed and we follow him whom Thou hast sent .
So write us down among the witnesses . &quot;
And they devised a plot , and Allah devised , and Allah is the best of devisers .
( And remember ) when Allah said : &quot; O &apos; Iesa ( Jesus ) ! Verily , I will separate you from Me and will raise you to Myself , and I will set you above those who disbelieve ( in My Oneness ) , and make those who follow you above those who disbelieve ( in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism ) superior to those who disbelieve ( in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism ) till the Day of Resurrection .
Then you will return to Me , and I will judge between you concerning that over which you were at variance .
As for those who disbelieve , I will punish them in this world as well as in the Hereafter , and they will not find any helpers .
But as for those who believe and do good works , He will pay them in full their wages ; and God loves not the evildoers .
This is what We recite to you ( O Muhammad SAW ) of the Verses and the Wise Reminder ( i.e. the Quran ) .
Indeed , Jesus before Allah is like Adam . He created him from dust , then said to him , &quot; Be , &quot; and he was .
This is the truth from your Lord , so do not be among the doubters .
And whoever argues with you about him after the knowledge has come to you , say , “ Come , let us gather sons and your sons , and your sons , and your women , and your women , and your souls , and then let us pray humbly , and so lay the curse of Allah upon the liars . ”
This is the narrative of truth : there is no deity save Allah , and verily Allah is Exalted in Might , Wise .
But if they turn away , Allah indeed knows the wrongdoers .
Say : O People of the Book ! Come to a word common between us and you that we shall worship none but Allah , and that we shall not associate aught with Him , and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah .
Then if they turn away , say : bear witness that verily we are Muslims .
O People of the Scripture , why do you argue about Abraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him ? Will you not use reason ?
Here you are - those who argue about that of which you have knowledge , but why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge ?
God knows , but you do not know .
Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian ; but he was an upright man , a Muslim , and none of those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity .
Indeed the nearest of all people to Abraham are those who followed him , and this Prophet ( Muhammad ) and the believers ; and Allah is the guardian of the believers .
A party of the people of the Scripture ( Jews and Christians ) wish to lead you astray , but they only lead themselves astray , and they know not .
O People of the Scripture , why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah while you witness &#91; to their truth &#93; ?
O People of the Scripture ! Why do you mix truth with falsehood , and conceal the truth with your knowledge ?
And when a party of the People of the Scripture said : Believe in that which is revealed unto the believers , and disbelieve at the end thereof , haply they may return ;
And believe none except those who follow your religion . &quot;
Say , &quot; Indeed , the &#91; true &#93; guidance is the guidance of Allah . &quot;
&#91; Do not believe &#93; lest anyone should be given the like of what you were given or that they would argue with you before your Lord . Say , &quot; Indeed , &#91; all &#93; bounty is in the hand of Allah ; He gives it to whom He wills .
And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures &apos; needs , All-Knower .
He singles out for His mercy whomever He wishes , and Allah is dispenser of a great grace . ’
And among the People of the Book there are some who , if you entrust them with a heap of gold , will return it to you ; and among them is he who , if you entrust him with a single coin , will not repay it to you unless you constantly stand over him .
That is because they say , “ We are under no obligation towards the gentiles , ” and they attribute lies to God , and they know it .
But whoever fulfills his pledge and fears Allah - then indeed , Allah loves those who fear Him .
Verily those who barter Allah &apos;s covenant and their oaths for a small price will have no portion in the Hereafter , and Allah will not speak unto them , nor will He look at them on the Day of Resurrection , nor will He purify them , and theirs shall be a torment afflictive .
And lo ! a party of them twist their tongue with the Scripture , that ye may detest a part of the Scripture , while it is not from the Scripture , and they say : This is from Allah , whereas it is not from Allah , and they speak a lie against Allah while they know .
It is not ( possible ) for a man to whom Allah has given the Book and Al-Hukun ( the knowledge and understanding of the laws of religion , etc . ) and Prophethood to say to the people : &quot; Be my worshippers rather than Allah . &quot; But ( he would say ) : &quot; Be ye worshippers of Him , because of the teaching of your Scriptures and of your studying it . &quot;
Nor would he command you to take the angels or the prophets for lords ( gods ) .
Would He order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Him ?
And recall what time Allah took a bond from the prophets saying : when I vouchsafed unto you the Book and Wisdom , and thereafter there shall come unto you an apostle confessing to that which is with you , ye shall surely believe in him and succour him .
He said , ‘ Do you pledge and take My covenant on this condition ? ’
They said , “ We agree ” ; He said , “ Then bear witness , and I will be with you among the witnesses . ”
Whoever turns away after that — these are the sinners .
Do they want a religion other than the religion of God ?
To Him submits whoever is in the heavens and the earth , willingly or unwillingly , and to Him they will be returned .
Say : We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes , and what was given to Musa and Isa and the prophets from their Lord ; we do not make any distinction between any of them , and to Him do we submit .
And whoever desires a religion other than Islam , it will not be accepted from him , and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers .
How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and ( after ) they bore witness that the messenger is true and after clear proofs had come unto them ?
God does not guide the unjust .
Their reward is that on them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of men combined .
Abiding in it ; their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be respited .
Except those who repent thereafter and do righteous deeds , for indeed , Allah is Forgiving and Merciful .
But whoever disbelieves after his faith , and remains stubborn in disbelief , his repentance will not be accepted . These are the ones who stray .
Verily those who disbelieve and die in infidelity , there shall not be accepted from any one of them the whole earth full of gold , if they would ransom themselves therewith .
These ! theirs shall be a torment afflictive , and they shall have no helpers .
By no means shall you attain righteousness until ye spend of that which ye love ; and whatsoever ye expend , verily Allah is ever Aware .
All food was lawful to the Children of Israel , except what Israel forbade himself before the Torah was revealed .
Say , &quot; Then bring the Torah and read it , if you should be truthful . &quot;
And whoever fabricates lies against Allah after that — it is they who are the wrongdoers .
Say : Allah speaketh the truth .
So follow the religion of Abraham , the upright in faith ; he was not of the idolaters . &apos;
Verily , the first House ( of worship ) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah ( Makkah ) blessed and a guide for the &apos; Alamin ( mankind and jinns ) .
In it are clear signs , the station of Abraham .
Whoever enters it shall be secure .
Pilgrimage to the House is a duty to God for anyone who is able to undertake it .
And whoever disbelieves - then indeed , Allah is Free of need of the worlds .
Say : O followers of the Book ! why do you disbelieve in the communications of Allah while Allah is witness of what you do ?
Say : &apos; People of the Book , why do you bar the believers from God &apos;s way , desiring to make it crooked , yourselves being witnesses ?
And Allah is not unaware of what you do . &quot;
O you who believe ! If you obey a party of those who were given the Scripture , they will disbelieve you after your belief .
How can you disbelieve when the verses of Allah are recited to you and His Messenger is among you !
Whosoever holds fast to God , he is guided to the right way .
O ye who believe ! Fear Allah with due fear , and die not except ye be Muslims .
And hold fast to God &apos;s bond , together , and do not scatter ; remember God &apos;s blessing upon you when you were enemies , and He brought your hearts together , so that by His blessing you became brethren ; and you were upon the brink of the Fire , and He saved you from it .
Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you so that you may be guided .
And let there be from you a party who invite to good and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong , and they are the successful .
And do not be like those who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them ; and for them is a painful punishment .
On the day when ( some ) faces shall turn white and ( some ) faces shall turn black ; and as for those whose faces turn black : Did you disbelieve after your believing ? So taste the chastisement because you disbelieved .
And as for those whose faces will become white , they shall be in the mercy of Allah , and in it they shall abide .
These are the verses of Allah , which We recite to you ( O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him ) with truth ; and Allah wills no injustice to the entire world .
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth , and to Allah is the return of all matters .
You are the best nation ever brought forth to men ; you bid what is right , and forbid what is wrong , and you believe in God .
And if the People of the Scripture had believed , it would have been better for them ; among them are believers , but most of them are defiantly disobedient .
They will not harm you except for a little hurt , and if they fight you , they will turn their backs &#91; in flight &#93; , and then they will not be saved .
Abasement is prescribed for them , wherever they are overtaken , except when under a covenant with Allah or with men .
They have incurred the wrath of Allah , and have been stamped upon them . That is because they disbelieved in the revelations of Allah , and slew the prophets wrongfully ; that , because they disobeyed and were transgressors .
Yet they are not all alike .
Among the People of the Scripture is a community that stand &#91; in obedience &#93; ; they recite the verses of Allah during the night and prostrate &#91; in prayer &#93; .
Those believe in Allah and the Last Day , and enjoin what is right , and forbid what is wrong , and vie with one another in doing good works . These are among the righteous .
Whatever good they do , it shall not be for them ; and God knows the godfearing .
As for those who disbelieve , their riches and their children shall not avail them anything against God ; those are the inhabitants of the Fire , therein dwelling forever .
The parable of what they spend in this worldly life is that of a cold wind that strikes the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves .
So he destroyed him ; and God wronged them not , but themselves they were wont to wrong .
O you who believe !
They will not fail to destroy you . They wish for your ruin .
Hatred has already appeared from their mouths , but what you conceal within themselves is greater .
Now We have made clear to you the signs , if you understand .
Behold !
It is you who love them , but they do not love you , and you believe in all the ( heavenly ) Books .
And when they meet you , they say , “ We believe , ” but when they are alone , they bite their fingers in rage at you .
Say , &quot; Perish in your rage . &quot;
Indeed , Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts .
If good befalls you , it grieves them ; and if an evil afflicts you , they rejoice at it ; and if you are patient and guard ( against evil ) their guile will not harm you in the least ; surely Allah encompasses what they do .
And when you forsook your family in the morning to lodge the believers with the means of submission ; and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
When two groups among you almost faltered , and Allah was their Protector , and in Allah let the believers put their trust .
And when Allah helped you at Badr , while you were weak ; so be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah , so that you may give thanks .
When thou saidst to the believers , &apos; Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down upon you ?
If you remain steadfast and mindful of God , your Lord will help you with five thousand angels , well trained .
And this Allah made it not but as good tidings for you , and that your hearts might be set at rest , there is no help except from Allah , the Mighty , the Wise .
That He may cut off a part of the infidels or abase them so that they may return disappointed .
It is not for you to relent towards them whether He will forgive them or punish them , for they are the evildoers .
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills . And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful .
O you who believe ! do not devour usury , making it double in increase , but be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah , that you may be successful .
And fear the Fire , which is prepared for the disbelievers .
and obey God and the Messenger ; haply so you will find mercy .
And hasten to the forgiveness of your Lord and to a garden as wide as heaven and earth , prepared for those who guard ( against evil ) ,
Those who spend ( benevolently ) in prosperity and adversity , and those who restrain anger , and pardon men ; and Allah loves the doers of good ( to others ) .
And those who , when they commit an immoral act or wrong themselves , remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins – and who forgives sins except Allah ? And those who do not knowingly persist in what they do .
For such the reward is forgiveness from their Lord , and Gardens beneath which rivers flow – abiding in it forever ; and what an excellent reward for the performers ( of good deeds ) !
Many eras have passed away before you ; so travel the earth , and observe how was the fate of the deniers .
This is a proclamation to the people , and a lesson for the righteous .
And do not falter and grieve – you will be victorious if you are believers .
If a wound touches you , a similar wound has afflicted the others .
Such days We alternate between the people , that God may know the believers , and choose witnesses from among you ; and God does not love the evildoers .
And that Allah may purify the believers and destroy the disbelievers .
Or do you think that Allah will not know those among you who have fought ( in His Cause ) and not yet known those who are As-Sabirin ( the patient ones , etc . ) ?
You were longing for death before you met it ; now you have seen it with your own eyes .
Muhammad is no more than a Messenger ; Messengers have passed away before him .
And if he dies or is killed , will you turn back on your heels ?
And whoever turns back on his heels , he does not harm Allah at all ; but Allah will soon reward the grateful .
No one can die without the permission of God . This is an appointed time for all .
And whoever desires the reward of this world - We will give him thereof ; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter - We will give him thereof ; and We will reward the grateful .
Many were the Prophets on whose side a large number of God-fearing fought : they neither lost heart for all they had to suffer in the way of Allah nor did they weaken , nor did they abase themselves ; and Allah loves the patient .
And their speech was not but that they said , &quot; Our Lord , forgive us our sins and our sins , and make our feet steady , and help us against the disbelieving people . &quot;
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the best reward of the hereafter ; and Allah loves the doers of good .
O you who believe ! If you obey the unbelievers , they will turn you back on your heels , and you will be the losers .
But Allah is your protector , and He is the best of helpers .
We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve , because they set up with Allah that for which He has not sent any authority , and their abode is the fire , and evil is the abode of the unjust .
And Allah had already fulfilled His promise to you when you were killing them by His permission until &#91; the time of &#93; when you lost courage and disputed about the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you longed .
Some of you want the worldly life and they ask others for the life hereafter .
Then He turned you away from them that He might try you ; and He has pardoned you .
And Allah is full of bounty to the believers .
When you were going up , and paid no heed for anyone , and the Messenger was calling you from behind ; so He rewarded you with grief upon grief that you might not sorrow for what escaped you , neither for what smote you ; and God knows the things you do .
Then , after grief , He sent down security for you . Slumber overtook a party of you , while another party , who were anxious only for themselves , entertained false notions about Allah , the notions of &#91; pagan &#93; ignorance .
They said , &quot; Have we anything to do with this ? &quot;
Say , &quot; Indeed , the matter belongs to Allah entirely . &quot;
They conceal within themselves what they would not reveal to you , saying , ‘ Had we any hand in the matter , we would not have been slain here . ’
Say thou : had ye been in your houses , those decreed to be slain would surely have gone forth to their places of slaughter ; and that Allah might prove that which is in your breasts and purge that which is in your hearts ; and Allah is the Knower of that which is in the breasts .
Lo ! those of you who turned their backs on the day of the two hosts , it was Satan who caused them to stumble , because of some of their deeds .
But Allah has pardoned them . Indeed , Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing .
O ye who believe ! Be not like the Unbelievers who say of their brethren when they journey in the land or go to religious war : &quot; If they had stayed with us , they would not have died or been slain . &quot;
God has decreed this to be a source of anguish for their hearts .
And Allah gives life and causes death , and Allah is Seeing of what you do .
If ye are slain in the way of Allah , or die , verily Allah &apos;s forgiveness and mercy are better than that which ye hide .
And if ye die or are slain , unto Allah ye will be gathered .
It is by God &apos;s grace that thou wast gentle to them ; hadst thou been harsh and hardhearted , they would have gone away from thee .
So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the affair ; and when thou art resolved , put thy trust in Allah ; verily Allah loveth those who put their trust in Him .
If Allah helps you , none can overcome you ; and if He forsakes you , who is there that can help you after Him ?
And in Allah let the believers put their trust .
It is not for a Prophet to defraud , whosoever defrauds shall bring that fraud on the Day of Resurrection ; then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned , and they shall not be wronged .
So is one who follows the pleasure of Allah like one who has incurred the wrath from Allah and whose abode is hell , and it is an evil destination ?
They are in different ranks with Allah ; and Allah is seeing your deeds .
Surely Allah is gracious to the believers when He raised up from among them a Messenger from themselves , to recite to them His verses , to purify them , and to teach them the Book and the Wisdom , though before that they were in manifest error .
And when a calamity befalls you , after you had yourselves inflicted twice as much , you said , “ How is this ? ”
Say : It is from yourselves .
Lo ! Allah is Able to do all things .
What befell you on the day when the two armies met was by God ’ s leave , so that He may ascertain the faithful .
and that He might know the hypocrites ; and it was said to them , &apos; Come , fight in God &apos;s way , or defend yourselves &apos; ; and they said , &apos; If we knew how to fight , we would have followed you &apos; ; and on that day they were nearer to unbelief than to unbelief , they said with their mouths what was not in their hearts ; and God knows what they hide ;
Those who said to their brothers while they themselves stayed behind , “ Had they obeyed us , they would not have been killed ” ; say , “ Then avert death from yourselves , if you are truthful . ”
Do not consider those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead , while they are alive with their Lord , and they have provision therein .
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His Bounty , and rejoicing for the sake of those who follow them : no fear shall come on them , nor shall they grieve .
They rejoice in God ’ s mercy , and His grace , and that God does not waste the reward of the faithful .
As for those who answered God and the Messenger after the persecution that befell them , those of them who did good and feared God shall have a mighty wage .
Those to whom the people said , &apos; Behold , a people have befallen you , and fear them &apos; ; they increased them only in belief , and they said , &apos; God is sufficient for us ; He is the best of providers . &apos;
So they returned with Allah ’ s grace and grace , untouched by evil ; and they followed the pleasure of Allah ; and Allah is Extremely Munificent .
But Satan desires only to be afraid of his helpers , but do not fear them ; fear Me , if you are believers .
And do not be grieved by those who rush into disbelief ; they cannot harm Allah at all ; Allah does not will to give them any portion in the Hereafter ; and for them is a great punishment .
Those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith do not harm Allah in the least , but for them is a painful doom .
And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is good for them ; We give them respite only that they may grow in their sinfulness ; and for them is a disgraceful punishment .
Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now , until He will separate the wicked from the good .
And Allah does not make you acquainted with the Unseen , but Allah chooses of His apostles whom He pleases ; so believe in Allah and His apostles ; and if you believe and guard ( against evil ) , then you shall have a great reward .
And let not those who covetously withhold of that which Allah hath given them of His bounty think that it is better for them .
Nay , it will be worse for them ; and they will be collared with what they were niggardly about on the Day of Resurrection .
And to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth , and Allah knows your deeds .
Assuredly Allah heard the saying of those who said : verily Allah is poor , and we are rich .
We want to write down their words and their unjust words from the prophets and say , &quot; Suffer the torment of burning .
That is for what your hands have sent ahead , and because Allah is not tyrannical to the servants .
Those who say : &apos; Allah has promised us that we believe not in any Messenger unless he brings to us an offering consumed by fire &apos; Say : &apos; Messengers came to you before me with clear signs , and with that you spoke of ; why then did you slay them , if you speak truly ?
And if they deny you , &#91; O Muhammad &#93; - so were messengers denied before you , and they came with clear proofs and scriptures and the enlightening Scripture .
Every soul shall taste death , and you shall surely be paid in full your wages on the Day of Resurrection ; and he who is kept away from the Fire and shall be made to enter the joyful .
The life of this world is nothing but the wares of delusion .
You shall surely be tried in your possessions and your selves , and you shall hear much hurt from those who were given the Book before you , and from those who associate others with God .
But if you are patient and Godwary , that is indeed the steadiest of courses .
And when Allah made a covenant with those who were given the Book : You shall most certainly make it known to men and you shall not hide it ; but they cast it behind their backs and sold it for a small price ; and evil is that which they buy .
Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done , and love to be praised for what they have not done -- do not think them to be secure from the chastisement ; for them awaits a painful chastisement .
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth , and Allah has power over all things .
Verily in the creation of the heavens and the earth , and in the alternation of the night and the day , are signs Unto the men of understanding .
Those who remember Allah while standing , sitting , and &#91; lying &#93; on their sides , and reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth , &#91; saying &#93; , &quot; Our Lord , You did not create this in vain .
Exalted is You , so protect us from the punishment of the Fire .
Our Lord ! Whomsoever Thou causest to enter the Fire , him Thou hast indeed humiliated and for the wrong-doers there shall be no helpers .
Our Lord , indeed we have heard a caller calling to faith , &#91; saying &#93; , &quot; Believe in your Lord , &quot; and we have believed .
Our Lord ! Forgive us our sins , and remit from us our evil deeds , and make us die with the righteous .
&quot; Our Lord ! Grant us what You promised to us through Your Messengers , and disgrace us not on the Day of Resurrection ; for You never break ( Your ) Promise . &quot;
And their Lord answered them , “ I do not waste the work of any worker among you , whether male or female ; you are all on the same footing .
And those who emigrated , and were expelled from their habitations , those who suffered hurt in My way , and fought , and were slain -- them I shall acquit of their evil deeds , and I shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow &apos; A reward from God ; God is the fairest reward . &apos;
Do not be deceived by the changing of the unbelievers in the land .
It is but a brief comfort for them ; and their resort is Hell , a hapless journey &apos;s end .
But whoever fears his Lord - for him are gardens beneath which rivers flow ; they will abide therein eternally , an entertainment from Allah , and that which is with Allah is best for the righteous .
And most surely of the followers of the Book there are those who believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to them , being lowly to Allah and they do not sell Allah &apos;s communications for a small price .
Those will have their reward with their Lord ; indeed Allah is swift at reckoning .
O ye who believe ! Endure and be patient , and keep your duty to Allah , in order that ye may succeed .
O mankind ! Fear your Lord , who created you from a single soul , and created its mate from it , and from the two of them He created many men and women .
Fear God , in Whose name you ask one another , and be mindful of your blood relations .
Indeed , Allah is ever , over you , a Watcher .
And give to the orphans their property , and do not exchange ( your ) bad things for ( their ) good , and devour not their property with your property ; surely that is a great sin .
And if ye fear that ye shall not deal justly with the orphan girls , then marry such women as seem good to you , two , three , four ; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly ( with them ) , then one or ( only ) that your right hands possess .
This will make it more likely that you will avoid injustice .
And give the women their bridal money willingly , and if they wish to give up some of it to you , then consume it with pleasure .
And give not unto the foolish your property which Allah hath made a means of support for you , but feed and clothe them therefrom , and speak unto them reputably .
And test the orphans until they attain puberty ; then if you perceive in them sound judgement , deliver to them their property ; and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily before they grow up .
And whoever is rich must abstain from it , and whoever is poor , let him consume with kindness .
And when you hand over their property to them , take witnesses in their presence ; it is sufficient that Allah is the Reckoner .
For men is a share of what parents and relatives leave behind , and for women is a share of what parents and relatives leave behind .
Say : &quot; Spend ye a little or small ( thing ) , it is little , - a legal share ( according to the measure ) .
And when the division is attended by relatives and orphans and the needy , provide for them &#91; something &#93; from it and speak to them honourable words .
Those who are concerned about the fate of their weak children , in case they leave them behind , should fear God , and speak appropriate words .
Lo ! those who unjustly devour the substance of orphans , those who eat up fire into their bellies , and presently they shall roast in the Blaze .
Allah sets forth for you concerning your children : to the male the like of the share of two females .
But if there are more than two daughters , they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance ; if there is only one , she shall have half the inheritance .
For parents , a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children ; if no children , and the parents are the ( only ) heirs , the mother has a third ; if the deceased left brothers or sisters , the mother has a sixth ; after payment of legacies and debts .
You know not which of them , whether your parents or your children , are nearest to you in benefit .
This is a commandment from Allah ; and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
And for you a half of what your wives leave if they have no children ; but if they have children , then for you of what they leave a fourth , after any bequest they may bequeath , or any debt .
If a man or woman have no direct heirs , but have a brother or a sister , to each of the two a sixth .
If there are more siblings , they shall receive one-third of the legacy after payment of legacies and debts . This is a commandment from God and He is all knowing and forbearing .
These are the limits of Allah ; and whoever obeys Allah and His Noble Messenger – Allah will admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow – abiding in it forever ; and this is the great success .
And whosoever disobeyeth Allah and His apostle and transgresseth His bond , him He shall cast into the Fire , as abiders therein ; and unto him shall be a torment ignominious .
And if any of your women are guilty of lewdness , call in four witnesses from among you against them , and call to witness against them four witnesses until death overtakes them or Allah gives them a way .
If two men among you commit it , punish them both .
But if they repent and mend their ways , leave them alone ; God is compassionate and merciful .
Repentance with Allah is only for those who do evil in ignorance , then turn ( to Allah ) ; these it is to whom Allah turns ( mercifully ) , and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
But repentance is not for those who do evil deeds until , when death approaches one of them , he says , “ Now I repent , ” nor for those who die as disbelievers .
For them We have prepared a painful punishment .
O ye who believe ! It is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will , nor should ye detain them in order that ye may take away part of that which ye have given them , unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness .
Live with them honorably , but if you dislike them , it may be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed much good .
And if you wish to replace one wife with another , and you have given one of them a great amount &#91; of gold &#93; , do not take anything away from it .
Would you take it by way of calumny and flagrant sin ?
How can you take it back , when you have enjoyed one another , and they have taken from you a solemn covenant ?
And do not marry the women whom your fathers married , except what has already passed ; indeed it is shameful and hateful , and an evil way .
Forbidden unto you are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters and your father &apos;s sisters and your mother &apos;s sisters and your brother &apos;s daughters and your sister &apos;s daughters and your foster-mothers and your foster-sisters and your mothers-in-law and your step-daughters who are of your wives unto whom ye have gone in , but if ye have not gone in unto them , then it is no sin for you .
And ( also forbidden to you ) are the wives of your sons who are from your own loins , and that you should have two sisters together , except what has already passed ; surely Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
Also ( forbidden are ) women already married , except those ( captives and slaves ) whom your right hands possess .
This is the decree of God for you .
And it is lawful for you ( to marry other ) women except those of your property , desiring chastity , not unlawful sexual intercourse .
As for those to whom you have spent their dowries , give them their wages .
There is no blame on you for what you mutually agree to beyond the obligation .
Lo ! Allah is Knower , Wise .
And whoever among you cannot &#91; find &#93; the means to marry free , believing women , then &#91; he may marry &#93; from the believing maids whom your right hands possess . And Allah is most knowing of your faith .
So marry them with their people &apos;s permission , and give them their wages according to what is fair , neither committing fornication nor taking secret paramours .
And if they are in wedlock after they have been taken in wedlock , they shall be half the chastisement for free women .
This is for those of you who fear lest he should fall into sin .
It is better for you to be patient , and Allah is all-forgiving , all-merciful .
Allah intendeth to expound unto you and to guide you into the dispensations of those before you and relent toward you ; and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
And Allah wants to turn to you in mercy ; and those who followed the lower ones desire that you should deviate &#91; from the right path &#93; in a great deviation .
Allah wishes to lighten your burden , for man was created weak .
O you who believe ! do not eat up your property among yourselves unjustly , but trade by mutual consent ; and do not kill yourselves , surely Allah is Merciful to you .
Whoever does that through transgression and wrongdoing , We will cast him into the Fire , and that is easy for Allah .
If you avoid the worst of what you are forbidden , We will remove from you your misdeeds and make you a noble place .
And covet not the thing in which Allah hath made some of you excel others .
For men is a share of what they have earned , and for women is a share of what they have earned .
And ask Allah for His bounty .
Lo ! Allah is Knower of all things .
And for all , We have made heirs to what parents and near relatives leave behind , and those with whom you have made an agreement .
So give them their share ; God is witness over everything .
Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others , and because they spend out of their property .
Therefore , the women who are steadfast and those who remain steadfast in secret to Allah &apos;s help .
As for those from whom you fear rebelliousness , admonish them , &#91; first &#93; avoid them in beds , and &#91; finally &#93; beat them .
Then if they obey you , do not seek to harm them .
Lo ! Allah is Exalted , Great .
And if you fear a breach between the two , appoint an arbiter from his family and an arbiter from her people .
If they both desire reconcile , God will bring them together ; God is All-knowing , All-aware .
Worship Allah , and ascribe no partner to Him , and be good to parents , and to relatives , and orphans , and the needy , and the related neighbour , and the unrelated neighbour , and the close associate , and the traveller , and your slaves .
Lo ! Allah loveth not the proud , the boastful ,
Those who are niggardly and enjoin niggardliness on others , and hide that which Allah hath vouchsafed unto them of His grace ; and We have gotten ready for the infidels a torment ignominious .
Those who spend their wealth to show off to people , but have no faith in God and the Last Day . Whoever has Satan as his close companion has a higher position for him .
What harm would it have done them if they believed in God and the Last Day , and spent out of what God has provided them ?
God knows them very well .
Lo ! Allah wrongeth not even of an atom &apos;s weight , and ( so ) there is a good deed , He multiplieth it and giveth from Himself a mighty hire .
How will it be then , when We bring from every nation a witness , and bring you ( O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him ) as a witness against these people ?
On that Day , those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth will be levelled with them , and they will not be able to hide anything from God .
O you who believe ! Do not approach prayer when you are intoxicated , until you know what you say , nor when you are polluted , except when you have washed yourselves , until you have washed yourselves .
But if you are sick or on a journey , or any of you comes from the toilet , or you have touched women , and you cannot find water , then find clean sand and wipe your faces and your hands with it ; surely Allah is Pardoning , Forgiving .
Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Scripture has been given purchasing error &#91; in exchange for it &#93; and wishing you would lose the way ?
And Allah is most knowing of your enemies ; and sufficient is Allah as a protector , and sufficient is Allah as a helper .
Among the Jews there are some who distort words from their &#91; proper &#93; usages and say , &quot; We hear and disobey &quot; and &quot; Hear without listening &quot; and be not heard &quot; and &quot; Look at us , &quot; twisting with their tongues and slander to faith .
And if they had said : &quot; We hear and we obey &quot; , and &quot; Listen to us , and &quot; and &quot; Do make us understand , &quot; it would have been better for them and more upright .
But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief , so they do not believe except a few .
O you who have been given the Book ! Believe in what We have sent down confirming what is with you , before We destroy countenances and turn them backwards , or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers ; and Allah &apos;s command is always executed .
Allah forgiveth not ( the sin of ) joining other gods with Him ; but He forgiveth what is less than that to whom He will .
Whoever ascribes partners to God is a monstrous sin .
Have you not seen those who purify themselves ?
But it is Allah who purifies whom He wills , and they will not be wronged &#91; so much as &#93; a single date-thread .
See how they fabricate lies against Allah , and this is sufficient as a manifest sin .
Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book has been given believing in idols and fake deities and saying of the unbelievers that they are better guided than the believers ?
Those are they whom Allah has cursed ; and for him whom Allah curses , you will not find any helper .
Or do they have a share in the Kingdom ?
Then they would not give the people &#91; even as much as &#93; the speck on a date seed .
Or do they envy people for what Allah has given them of His bounty ?
Then We had already given the house of Abraham the Book and Wisdom and conferred upon them a great kingdom .
And of them are some who believe therein , and of them are some who turn away therefrom ; and Hell is a hapless destination .
And ( as for ) those who disbelieve in Our communications , We will make them enter fire ; so oft as their skins are cooked We shall change them for other skins , that they may taste the chastisement ; surely Allah is Mighty , Wise .
But as for those who believe and do righteous deeds , We will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow , wherein they will abide forever , and will have purified spouses , and We will admit them into a secure shade .
God commands you to deliver trusts back to their rightful owners , and when you judge between people , to judge with justice .
Verily , how excellent is the teaching which Allah gives you , and Allah is All-Hearer , All-Seer .
O you who believe ! obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those in authority among you ; and if you dispute about anything , refer it to Allah and the Apostle if you believe in Allah and the last day .
That is the best &#91; way &#93; and best in result .
Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you ?
And when it is said unto them : Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and unto the messenger , thou seest the hypocrites turn away from thee with aversion .
But how will it be when an affliction visits them because of the former deeds ? Then , they will come to you , swearing by God , &apos; We desired nothing but good , and decided between them . &apos;
These are they of whom Allah knoweth that which is in their breasts .
So turn away from them and admonish them , and say to them concerning themselves penetrating words .
And We did not send a Messenger except that he was obeyed by permission of Allah .
And if they had come to you , after they had wronged themselves , and they had asked forgiveness of Allah , and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them , they would have surely found Allah Forgiving and Merciful .
But no , by your Lord , they will not be believers until they make you a judge of what is in dispute between them , then they will not find within their hearts any remembrance of your Lord and will surrender to Him in full submission .
Had We prescribed for them : &apos; Slay yourselves &apos; or &apos; Leave your houses &apos; they would not have done it , except a few of them . But if they had been given that , it would have been better for them , and stronger in confirming their faith .
And then We would surely have vouchsafed unto them from Our presence a mighty hire .
And certainly We should guide them to the right path .
Whosoever obeys God and the Messenger , let him be with those whom God has blessed , Prophets , truthful , martyrs , and the righteous people .
That is a mercy from Allah , and Allah suffices as Knower .
O ye who believe ! Take your precautions , and ( either ) go forth in detachments or sally forth all together .
Among you is he who turns back , and if an affliction visits you , he says , ‘ Indeed Allah has been gracious to me that I was not present with them . ’
But if a bounty from God is given to you , he will say , &quot; I wish I had never been with them , I should have achieved a great success . &quot;
So let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter .
And whoever fights in the cause of Allah , then is killed or overpowered - We will give him a great reward .
And why should you not fight in the cause of Allah and for the weak among men , women , and children , who say : Our Lord ! bring us forth from this town whose people are oppressors , and give us from Thee a guardian , and give us from Thee a helper ?
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah , and those who disbelieve fight in the way of the Shaitan . Fight then against the party of Shaitan .
Lo ! the strategy of the devil is weak .
Have you not seen those to whom it was said , &apos; Restrain your hands , establish the prayer , and pay the alms &apos; ?
But when fighting was ordained for them , a party of them feared men as one should fear Allah , or even more , and they said : &apos; Our Lord , why have You ordained fighting for us ?
Can You not grant us respite for a little while ? &quot;
Say : The enjoyment of this world is little , and surely the hereafter is better for those who guard ( against evil ) , and you shall not be dealt with unjustly .
Wherever you may be death will overtake you , even if you were in fortified towers .
And if good befalls them , they say : This is from Allah ; and if evil befalls them , they say : This is from you .
Say : All is from Allah .
Why , then , do they not understand a single people of what they are saying ?
Whatever good befalls you is from Allah , and whatever ill befalls you is from yourself .
And We have sent you ( O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him ) as a Noble Messenger towards mankind ; and Allah is Sufficient , as a Witness .
Whoever obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah . And whoever turns away - We have not sent you over them as a guardian .
They say , &apos; Obedience &apos; but when they leave thee , a party of them meditate all night on other than what thou sayest ; God writes down what they hide .
So turn away from them , and put your trust in God ; God suffices as a guardian .
They do not think about the Quran .
If it had been from other than Allah , they would have found in it much discrepancy .
When there comes to them some matter touching ( public ) safety or fear , they broadcast it .
But if they had referred it to the Messenger , and to those before them , those possessed of knowledge , the proper investigators would have Tested only for the Grace of Allah to you and His Mercy , all but a few of you would have followed Satan .
Therefore , fight in the way of Allah , you are not held responsible except for yourself , and fight the believers in the fighting .
It may be that Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve , and Allah &apos;s might is the greatest in might , and He is the most severe in requiting ( evil ) .
Whoever intercedes for a good cause shall receive a share of it , and whoever intercedes for an evil cause shall share its burden , and Allah has power over all things .
And when you are greeted with a greeting , greet with a better one than it , or return it .
Verily Allah is of everything the Reckoner .
Allah , there is no god except He .
He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt ; and who is more truthful in speech than Allah ?
What is the matter with you that you are two parties about the hypocrites ?
God has condemned them for their misdeeds .
Do you want to guide those whom God has caused to go astray ?
And whomsoever Allah sendeth astray , for him thou shalt not find a way .
They wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve , so that you may all be alike .
So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate in the way of Allah .
And if they turn away , seize them and kill them wherever you invite them , and do not take from among them allies or helpers .
Except those who join a people with whom you have a treaty , and those who come to you with their hearts reluctant to fight you or fight their own people .
Had Allah willed , He could have given them power over you , and then they would have fought you .
Therefore , if they keep away from you and do not fight you , and offer you peace , then Allah has not given you any way against them .
You will find others who wish to be safe from you , and secure from their own people ; as often as they are returned to hostility , they are plunged into it .
So if they do not withdraw from you , nor offer you peace , nor restrain their hands , seize them and kill them wherever you come upon them .
For such We have given you a clear warrant against them .
It is not for a believer to kill another believer except by mistake ; and whoever kills a believer by mistake , he should free a believing slave , and pay blood-money to his family , unless they remit it as charity .
But is he the matter with a people who are your enemy , and the slain is a believer , the freeing of a believing slave ( is prescribed ) ; but if he be from a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance , compensation ( blood money , etc . ) must be paid to his family , and a believing slave must be freed .
Anyone who lacks the means must fast for two consecutive months , by way of repentance to Allah ; and Allah is All Knowing , Wise .
And whoever kills a believer intentionally , his recompense is Hell to abide therein , and Allah will be wroth with him and will remove from him a great punishment .
O you who believe ! When you go forth in the way of Allah , make a proper study , and do not say to him who offers you the greeting of peace : You are not a believer .
Ye seek the good things of the life of the world , whereas Allah is of abundant bounty .
Even thus were ye yourselves aforetime ; then Allah hath shown you His grace . So make things clear .
Verily , Allah is All-Aware of what you do .
Not equal are the holders back among the believers , save those who strive and fight in the way of Allah with their riches and their lives .
God has exalted in rank those who struggle with their possessions and their selves over those who sit at home .
But to every one Allah has promised good , and Allah has graced those who wage jihad over the ones who sit back with a great reward .
Degrees from Him and forgiveness and mercy ; and Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And the angels , who wronged themselves , will say , when the angels take them in death , &quot; What was it you were ? &quot;
They will say , &quot; We were oppressed in the land . &quot;
The angels say , &quot; Was not the earth of Allah spacious for you that you could have migrated therein ? &quot;
They are the ones whose abode shall be Hell , an evil destination .
Except for the oppressed among men , women and children who cannot devise a plan , nor are they able to find a way ( to escape ) .
These are they unto whom Allah will relent . Allah is Forgiving , Forgiving .
Whosoever emigrates in the way of Allah shall find in the earth plentiful refuge and abundance .
But whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allah and His Messenger and then death overtakes him - his reward is already incumbent upon Allah , and Allah is all-forgiving , all-merciful .
And when you travel in the land , there is no sin on you if you shorten the prayer if you fear that the unbelievers may cause you harm ; surely the unbelievers are your manifest enemies .
When you are among them , and lead them in prayer , let a group of them stand with you , and let them carry their weapons .
After making their prostrations , let them be behind you and let another party who have not prayed , pray with you , and let them take their precautions and their weapons ; the unbelievers love that you may neglect your weapons and your baggage , so that they might swoop upon you in a single rush .
But there is no sin upon you if you put aside your arms if you are troubled or are sick , but take precaution .
Indeed , Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment .
Then when ye have finished the prayer , remember Allah , standing and sitting and reclining .
Then , when you are secure , perform the prayer , surely the prayer is a timed prescription for the believers .
And do not be weak in pursuit of the enemy .
If you are aching , they are aching as you are aching .
But you expect from God what they do not expect .
And Allah is Knowing and Wise .
Indeed We have sent down to you the Book with the truth , so that you may judge between the people by what Allah has shown you ; so do not be an advocate for the traitors .
And ask forgiveness of Allah ; surely Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And do not plead for those who deceive themselves ; indeed Allah does not like someone who is treacherous and sinful .
They seek to hide from men , but they cannot hide from God , and He is with them , when they meditate by night discourse unwillingly , God is aware of what they do .
There you are , arguing on their behalf in the present life , but who will argue with God on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection , or who will be their defender ?
And whoever does evil or wrongs himself , and then asks forgiveness of Allah , will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful .
And whoever commits a sin , he earns it against himself ; and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
And whoever commits a mistake or a sin , then blames it on an innocent person , has indeed burdened himself with falsehood and a manifest sin .
And had it not been for the grace of Allah on thee and His mercy , a party of them had surely resolved to mislead thee , and they could not hurt thee in aught , and Allah hath revealed unto thee the Book and Wisdom , and taught thee that which thou knewest not , and Allah &apos;s grace upon thee was ever mighty .
There is no good in most of their secret talks save ( in ) him who enjoins charity or that which is right or conciliation between men .
And whoever does this seeking the pleasure of Allah , We will give him a great reward .
And whosoever opposeth the apostle after the right path hath become manifest unto him , and followeth other way than that of the believers , We shall make him that to which he shall drive , and shall roast him in Hell - an evil retreat !
Allah forgiveth not ( the sin of ) joining other gods with Him ; but He forgiveth all else unto whom He pleaseth .
Whosoever associates with God anything , has surely gone astray into far error .
They ( the pagans ) only worship idols and Satan , the persistent rebel .
whom God has cursed , and rebelled against this , &quot; I will certainly take of Your servants a number of appointed ;
And surely I will lead them astray , and I will arouse desires in them , and I will command them so that they will slit the ears of the cattle , and I will command them so that they will change Allah &apos;s creation .
Whosoever takes Satan for a guardian , instead of God , has surely suffered a manifest loss .
Satan makes promises to them and fills them with vain desires , and Satan promises them what they are deluded .
Those , their refuge shall be Gehenna , and from it they shall find no refuge .
And ( as for ) those who believe and do good , We will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow , to abide therein ; ( it is ) a true promise of Allah ; and who is more truer in speech than Allah ?
It will not be in accordance with your desires , nor the desires of the People of the Book ; whoever commits evil will be requited accordingly ; and he will not find for himself besides Allah any guardian or helper .
But those who do good works , be they male or female , believing - those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged in the least .
And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good and follows the religion of Abraham , inclining toward truth ?
And Allah took Abraham for a friend .
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth , and Allah encompasses all things .
And they ask you a decision concerning women .
Say : Allah gives you a ruling concerning them , and what is recited to you in the Book concerning the orphan women to whom you do not give what is prescribed for them , and whom you desire to marry , and about the weak among children , and that you should deal justly with orphans .
Whatever good you do , God is aware of it . ”
And if a woman fears ill treatment from her husband or disinterest , there is no blame upon either of them if they reach an amicable settlement between themselves .
Man is prone to selfish greed .
But if ye do good and keep from evil , lo ! Allah is ever Informed of what ye do .
You will not be able to treat your wives with equal fairness , no matter how much you desire it .
But do not be altogether partial so that you leave another suspended .
And if ye make amends and act righteously , then verily Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
But if they separate , Allah will suffice them out of His bounty , and Allah is all-bounteous , all-wise .
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth .
And We have enjoined upon those who were given the Scripture before you , and yourselves , to fear Allah .
But if ye disbelieve , lo ! unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth . And Allah is Absolute , Owner of Praise .
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth , and Allah suffices as trustee .
If He wills , He will take you away , O people , and bring others . And Allah is Exalted in Might .
Whoever desires the reward of this world , then with Allah is the reward of this world and the hereafter ; and Allah is Hearing , Seeing .
O ye who believe ! Be ye staunch in justice , witnesses for Allah , even though it be against yourselves or your parents or your kindred .
Whether one is rich or poor , God is nearer to both ; so follow not the caprice , that you may be fair ; and if you twist or turn , then God is aware of the things you do .
O ye who believe ! Believe in Allah and His messenger and the Scripture which He hath revealed unto His messenger and the Scripture which He revealed aforetime .
And whoever does not believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His apostles and the Last Day has certainly strayed into far error .
Those who believe , then disbelieve , then believe , then disbelieve , then disbelieve , and then increase in unbelief , God will not forgive them , neither will He guide them on the way .
Announce to the hypocrites the tidings that there is for them a painful punishment .
Those who take unbelievers for their friends instead of the believers -- do they seek glory in them ?
Lo ! power belongeth wholly to Allah .
And certainly He has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear Allah &apos;s communications disbelieved in and mocked at , you sit not with them until they engage in some other talk , or else you would surely be like them .
God will gather the hypocrites , and the disbelievers , into Hell , altogether .
Those who wait upon you and if there comes to you a victory from Allah , they say , &quot; Were we not with you ? &quot;
But if the disbelievers have a share &#91; of punishment &#93; , they say , &quot; Did we not overcome you and defend you from the believers ? &quot;
Then Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection , and Allah will not give the disbelievers any way over the believers .
Lo ! the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah , but He will deal with them .
When they stand up for prayer , they stand up lazily , showing off to the people and not remembering Allah except a little .
They are hesitant people belonging to neither side .
And whomsoever Allah sendeth astray , for him thou ( O Muhammad ) wilt not find a way .
O ye who believe ! Take not for friends unbelievers rather than believers .
Would ye give Allah a clear warrant against yourselves ?
Surely the hypocrites shall be in the lowest reach of the Fire ; thou wilt not find for them any helper ;
Except those who repent and amend and hold fast to Allah and are sincere in their religion to Allah , these are with the believers , and Allah will certainly give the believers a great reward .
What will Allah do with your punishment , if you are grateful and believe ?
Allah is the Thankful , the Knower .
Allah loveth not the utterance of an evil thing save when an injustice is done , for lo ! Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
If you do good openly or keep it secret or pardon an evil , then surely Allah is Pardoning , Powerful .
Lo ! those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers , and ( those who ) say : We believe in some of His messengers , and disbelieve in some , and disbelieve in others , and seek to take a way ( to trifling ) ;
Those , they are the unbelievers in truth , and We have prepared for the unbelievers a humiliating chastisement .
But those who believe in God and His messengers and make no distinction between any of them , to those -- We shall surely give them their wages ; God is All-forgiving , All-compassionate .
The People of the Scripture ask you to bring down to them a book from heaven .
But they asked of Moses &#91; even &#93; greater than that , for they said , &quot; Show us Allah outright . &quot;
So the thunderbolt seized them for their wickedness .
Then they took the calf &#91; for worship &#93; after clear proofs , but We forgave them .
And We gave Moses a clear authority .
And We raised the Mount above them for the sake of their covenant , and We said to them , “ Enter the gate humbly , ” and We said to them , “ Do not violate the Sabbath , ” and We received from them a solemn covenant .
So when they broke their covenant and disbelieved in the signs of Allah , and they used to wrongfully martyr the Prophets , and said , “ Our hearts are under a veil ” ; in fact Allah has cursed them on account of their disbelief , so they do not accept faith , except a few .
And because of their disbelief , and because of their saying that which they have invented against Maryam ( Mary ) a lie .
And because of their saying , “ We killed the Messiah , Eisa the son of Maryam , the Messenger of Allah ” ; they did not kill him nor did they crucify him , but it was made to seem fair to them ; and those who differed in this matter are only in doubt concerning it ; they are in doubt of it ; they follow nothing but conjecture ; and they did not kill him .
Rather , Allah raised him up to Himself . And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise .
And there is none of the People of the Scripture but will surely believe in him before his death , and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them .
We forbade them for the Jews &#91; certain &#93; good things which had been made lawful for them , and because they had changed many ways in the way of Allah .
And because of their taking usury , they were forbidden it , and their consuming of the wealth of the people wrongfully .
And We have prepared for the faithless among them a painful punishment .
But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge , and the believers , believe in what has been revealed to you , and what was revealed before you , and those who keep up prayer and those who pay the poor-rate and those who believe in Allah and the last day , We shall give them a mighty reward .
We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him , and We revealed to Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , and the Tribes , Jesus , Job , Jonah , Aaron , and Solomon , and to David We gave the Psalms .
These messengers We have already related to you , &#91; some &#93; messengers of whom We have not related to you , and to Moses Allah spoke with &#91; direct &#93; speech .
( We sent ) messengers as bearers of good news and as warners , so that mankind may have no plea against Allah after the messengers .
And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise .
But God bears witness to what He has sent down to thee , that He has sent it down with His knowledge ; and the angels bear witness ; and God suffices for a witness .
Indeed those who are faithless and bar &#91; others &#93; from the way of Allah , have certainly strayed into far error .
Verily those who disbelieve and have done wrong , Allah shall not forgive them nor guide them unto a way .
Except the path of hell , in which they will abide for ever , and this is easy for Allah .
O mankind ! The Apostle has certainly come to you with the truth from your Lord , so believe , it is better for you ; and if you disbelieve , then surely whatever is in the heavens and the earth is Allah &apos;s ; and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
O People of the Scripture ! Do not exceed the limits in your religion , and do not say of Allah except the truth .
The Messiah &apos; Iesa ( Jesus ) , son of Maryam ( Mary ) , was ( no more than ) a Messenger of Allah ( and His Word ) , and His Word ( Be ! ) which He bestowed on Maryam ( Mary ) , and a spirit ( Ruh ) from Him .
So believe in God and His messengers , and do not say , “ Three . ”
God is the One God ; His is the One God ; to be Glory unto Him a son .
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth , and Allah suffices as trustee .
The Messiah does not disdain to be a servant of Allah , nor do the angels who are near to Him , and whoever disdains His worship and is ungrateful , He will gather them all together to Himself .
But as for those who believe and do good works , He will pay them in full their wages , and He will increase them of His bounty ; and as for those who disdain and are proud , He will chastise them with a painful chastisement .
And they will not find for themselves besides Allah any protector or any helper .
O mankind ! Truth has come to you from your Lord , and We have sent down to you a clear light .
As for those who believe in God , and hold fast to Him , He will admit them to His mercy and bounty , and will guide them to Him on a straight path .
They ask you for a verdict .
Say : &apos; God pronounces to you concerning the indirect heirs . If a man dies childless , and has a sister , she shall have half of what he leaves , and he shall inherit her if she has no children .
If there be two sisters , they shall receive two-thirds of what he leaves .
If there are both brothers and sisters , the male shall receive the share of two females . &quot;
God makes things clear to you , lest you go astray ; and God has knowledge of everything .
O ye who believe ! fulfil ( all ) obligations .
Lawful to you ( for food ) are all the beasts of cattle , except those mentioned to you ( here ) , so that you may hunt when you are free from Pilgrimage ( i.e. devotion to Makkah ) , verily , Allah commands what He wills .
O you who believe ! Do not violate God ’ s sacraments , nor the Sacred Month , nor the offerings , nor the garlanded , nor those heading for the Sacred House seeking the bounty and pleasure of their Lord .
Once you have finished the pilgrimage , you are free to hunt , but do not let your hatred of the people who barred you from the Holy Mosque move you to transgress .
And help one another in righteousness and piety , but do not help one another in sin and transgression .
And fear Allah ; indeed , Allah is severe in penalty .
Forbidden to you ( for food ) are : dead meat , blood , the flesh of swine , and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah ; that which hath been killed by strangling , or by a violent blow , or by a headlong fall , or by being gored to death ; that which hath been ( partly ) eaten by a wild animal ; unless ye are able to slaughter it ( in due form ) ; that which is sacrificed on stone ( altars ) ; ( forbidden ) also is the division ( of meat ) by raffling with arrows : that is impiety .
That is indeed a transgression .
Today the faithless have despaired of your religion . So do not fear them , but fear Me .
Today I have perfected your religion for you , completed My blessing upon you , and have chosen for you Islam as religion .
But whoever is forced by severe hunger , not inclining to sin - then indeed , Allah is Forgiving and Merciful .
They ask you what is lawful for them .
Say : &quot; Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibat &#91; all kind of Halal ( lawful ) foods which Allah has made lawful ( meat of slaughtered eatable animals , milk products , fats , vegetables and fruits , fruits , etc . ) &#93; .
Today all good things are lawful for you , and the food of those who were given the Book is lawful for you , and your food is lawful for them .
And so are the believing women and the chaste women of the people who were given the Scripture before you , when you give them their dowries , and take them in marriage , neither committing fornication nor taking them as mistresses .
And whoever disbelieves in the religion - his work is not in doubt , and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers .
O you who believe ! When you rise to pray , wash your faces and your hands to the elbows , and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles .
And if you are in a state of impurity , purify yourselves .
But if you are sick or on a journey , or any of you comes from the toilet , or you have touchedwomen , and you cannot find water , then find clean sand and wipe your faces and your hands with it .
Allah does not intend to make difficulty for you , but He intends to purify you and to complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful .
And remember the favor of Allah upon you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said , &quot; We hear and we obey . &quot;
And fear God ; surely God knows what the hearts conceal .
Be upright for Allah , bearers of witness with justice , and do not let the hatred of a group lead you to deviate from justice .
Be just : that is nearer to piety .
And fear God ; surely God is aware of the things you do .
God has promised those who believe and do good deeds forgiveness and a great reward .
But as for those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations — these are the inmates of the Blaze .
O ye who believe ! Remember the favour of Allah unto you when a party intended to stretch out their hands against you .
But he withheld their hands from you , and fear Allah , and in Allah let the believers put their trust .
Certainly Allah took a pledge from the Children of Israel , and We raised among them twelve leaders .
And Allah said : verily I am with you , if ye establish prayer and give the poor-rate and believe in My apostles and support them and lend unto Allah a goodly loan , I shall surely expiate from you your misdeeds and surely shall make you enter Gardens whereunder rivers flow .
But whoever of you turns back to disbelief after that has certainly strayed from the right way .
Because of their breaking their covenant , We cursed them and hardened their hearts .
They pervert the words from their meanings , and have forgotten a part of what they were reminded .
( Muhammad ) , you will not cease to be on their side , unless some of them are made to hear .
So pardon them , and turn away ; surely God loves the good-doers .
And with those who say , &quot; We are Christians , &quot; We took a covenant , but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded .
So We aroused enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection , and soon Allah will inform them of what they used to do .
O People of the Scripture ! Our Messenger has come to you , clarifying for you much of what you were concealing of the Scripture , and passing over much .
A light from God has come to you , and a clear Book .
Wherewith Allah guideth all who seek His good pleasure to ways of peace , and leadeth them out of darkness unto light , by His leave , unto a straight path .
They are unbelievers who say , &apos; God is the Messiah , son of Mary . &apos;
Say , &quot; Who then would prevent God if He so willed from destroying the Messiah , son of Mary , his mother , and everyone on earth ? &quot;
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them .
He creates what He wills , and Allah has power over all things .
And the Jews and the Christians say , &quot; We are the children of Allah and His beloved . &quot;
Say : Why then does He punish you for your sins ?
Nay , but ye are mortals of what He hath created .
He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He pleases ; and Allah &apos;s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them , and to Him is the eventual coming .
O people of the Scripture ( Jews and Christians ) ! Certainly , there has come to you Our Messenger ( Muhammad SAW ) , after a break in ( the series of ) our Messengers , lest you say : &quot; There came no bringer of glad tidings and no warner to us . &quot;
For now there has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner , Allah has power over all things .
And ( remember ) when Musa ( Moses ) said to his people : &quot; O my people ! Remember Allah &apos;s Favour to you when He raised Prophets amongst you , made you kings , and gave you that which He had not given to any other among you .
O my people ! Enter the holy land which Allah hath ordained for you , and turn not back ( from disbelief ) for then ye will turn back as losers .
They said , &quot; O Moses , indeed within it is a people of tyrannical strength , and indeed , we will not enter it until they leave it .
But when they leave it , then we will leave it .
Said two men of those who feared , whom God had blessed , &apos; Enter upon them at the gate , and enter upon them ; and when you have entered it , you shall be the victors .
Have trust in God if you are true believers &quot; .
They said , “ O Moses , we will not enter it , as long as they are in it .
Go , you and your Lord , and fight you two , we will stay here . &quot;
He said , &quot; I have no power over &#91; anyone &#93; except myself and my brother , so part us from the defiantly disobedient people . &quot;
He said : Then it shall surely be forbidden to them for forty years , they shall wander about in the earth , bewildered .
But do not grieve over the defiantly disobedient people . &quot;
Recite to them with truth the story of the two sons of Adam , when they both offered an offering , and it was accepted from one of them and was not accepted from the other .
The former said , &quot; I will kill you , &quot; and the other said , &quot; God accepts only from the righteous .
If you stretch forth your hand against me to kill me , I will not stretch out my hand against you to kill you , surely I fear Allah , the Lord of the worlds .
I would rather you bear the punishment of my sin and your sin , and become among the inmates of the Fire , and that is the recompense of the wrongdoers . ’
But he incited the love of his brother to kill him , so he killed him , and became one of the losers .
Then Allah sent a raven , who scratched the earth , to show him how to hide his brother &apos;s naked corpse .
Am I not able even to be as this raven , and so conceal my brother &apos;s vile body ? &apos; And he became full of remorse .
That is why We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever kills a soul , not in retaliation of murder or corruption on the earth , shall be as if he had killed all mankind . And whosoever saves a life , it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind .
And assuredly there came unto them Our apostles with evidences , yet even thereafter many of them are transgressors in the land .
The punishment of those who wage war against God and His Messenger , and strive with corruption in the land is that they shall be killed or crucified , or have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides , or be expelled from the land .
For them there is disgrace in this world , and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment .
Except for those who repent before you have them in your power ; so know that Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
O you who believe ! be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah , and seek the means of nearness to Him , and fight in His way , that you may be successful .
As for the unbelievers , if they possessed all that is in the earth , and twice as much , to ransom themselves from the chastisement on the Day of Resurrection , it would not be accepted of them ; for them awaits a painful chastisement .
They will wish to get out of the Fire , but their torment will not be relieved .
As for the thief , man or woman , cut off their hands as a punishment for what they have done , an exemplary punishment from Allah , and Allah is all-mighty , all-wise .
But whoever repents after that and reforms , Allah will turn to him with forgiveness , and Allah is all-forgiving , all-merciful .
Do you not know that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth ?
He punishes whom He pleases , and forgives whom He pleases ; and Allah has power over all things .
O Messenger , let not those grieve you who vie with one another in denying the truth , who say with their mouths , &quot; We believe , &quot; but their hearts have no faith .
And of the Jews are some who listen to falsehood , and they listen to others who have not come to you ; so they change the words from their places and say , “ If you are given this , accept it , but if you are not given it , beware ! ”
And whomsoever Allah willeth to mislead , thou shalt not avail him against Allah in aught .
Those are they whose hearts Allah would not purify ; for them is disgrace in this world , and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment .
They are listeners of falsehood , devourers of the forbidden .
So if they come to you , judge between them , or turn away from them .
And if you turn away from them , they cannot harm you in the least ; and if you judge , judge between them with justice ; surely Allah loves the equitable .
But how will they appoint you a judge , when they have the Torah in their possession , wherein is the judgement of Allah ?
Then , even after that , they would turn their backs , and they are not believers .
Surely We revealed the Torah , wherein is guidance and light ; by it the prophets who had surrendered themselves gave judgment for those of Jewry , as did the masters and the rabbis , as they were charged to preserve the Book of Allah , and were witnesses to it .
So fear not men , but fear Me ; and sell not My signs for a little price .
And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers .
And We prescribed for them therein : a life for a life , an eye for an eye , a nose for a nose , an ear for an ear , a tooth for a tooth , and for wounds retaliation ; but whosoever forgoes it in charity , it shall be an expiation for him ; and whosoever judgeth not by that which Allah hath sent down , then those ! they are the wrong-doers .
We sent , following in their footsteps , Jesus son of Mary , confirming the Torah that preceded him ; and We gave him the Gospel , wherein is guidance and light , and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah , and as guidance and admonition for the righteous .
And let the people of the Gospel judge by that which Allah hath revealed therein , and those who judge not by that which Allah hath sent down are the transgressors .
And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth , confirming the Scripture that preceded it , and a guardian over it . So judge between them by what Allah has revealed , and do not follow their inclinations from the truth that has come to you .
For each of you We have ordained a certain ordainment .
Had Allah willed , He would have made you one community .
But in order to test you in what He has given you .
So race to &#91; all that is &#93; good .
To Allah will be the return of all of you ; then He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ .
And that you judge between them according to what God has sent down , and do not follow their caprices , and beware of them , lest they tempt thee away from any of what God has sent down to thee .
And if they turn away , then know that Allah &apos;s Will is to afflict them for some of their sins ; and most of the people are transgressors .
Do they seek the bounds of Hell ?
And who is a better judge than Allah for a people who are certain &#91; in faith &#93; ?
O you who believe ! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends ; they are friends of each other ; and whoever among you takes them for friends , then surely he is one of them ; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people .
And thou shalt see those in whose hearts is a disease hastening toward them , saying : We fear lest a change of fortune should befall us .
Perhaps God will bring about victory , or some of His command .
Then will they repent of what they conceal in their hearts .
The believers will say , &quot; Are these the ones who swore by God with their most solemn oaths that they would stand by you ? &quot;
Their works have failed , and they have become losers .
O you who believe ! Whoever from among you turns back from his faith , then Allah will bring a people whom He loves and they will love Him , humble towards the believers , stern against the unbelievers , they will fight in the way of Allah and will not fear the reproach of the reproaches of the reproaches .
That is Allah ’ s grace , which He grants to whomever He wishes , and Allah is all-bounteous , all-knowing .
Your allies are God , His Messenger , and the believers ; those who perform the prayer , and pay the alms , and bow them down .
And whosoever befriendeth Allah and His apostle and the believers , then know that verily Allah &apos;s party ! they are the overcomers .
O you who believe ! do not befriend those who were given the Book before you , and those who disbelieve , from among those who take your religion for a jest and sport , and be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah , if you are believers .
And when you call to prayer , they take it for a mockery and a joke ; this is because they are a people who do not understand .
Say : &apos; People of the Book , do you blame us only because we believe in God , and in what has been sent down to us , and in what was sent down before ; and because most of you are ungodly ? &apos;
Say : Shall I inform you of those whose reward with Allah is worse than that ?
It is those whom Allah has cursed , and with whom He is angry , and made some of them apes and swine , and those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity .
Such are in worse plight and further astray from the right way . &quot;
And when they come to you , they say : We believe , but they come in disbelief and go forth in it ; and Allah knows best what they conceal .
You will see many of them competing with one another in sin and transgression , and their consuming of what is unlawful .
Evil indeed is what they have been doing .
Why do the rabbis and the scribes not speak to them of their sinful words and consume what is unlawful ?
Evil indeed is what they have been hastening .
And the Jews say : The hand of Allah is fettered .
May their hands be tied up , and may they be cursed for what they say .
Rather , His Hands are both outstretched ; He spends as He wills .
And what has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief .
And We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection .
Whenever they kindle the fire of war , Allah extinguishes it , and they strive to cause corruption in the land ; and Allah loveth not those who do mischief .
If the People of the Scripture had believed and feared Allah , We would have removed from them their misdeeds , and We would surely have brought them into the Gardens of Delight .
And if they had kept up the Taurat and the Injeel and that which hath now been sent down unto them from their Lord , they would surely have provision from above them and from beneath their feet , but many of them are a people who act well .
O Messenger , deliver what has been sent down to you from your Lord , and if you do not , you have not conveyed His Message .
And Allah will protect you from the people ; indeed Allah does not guide the disbelieving people .
Say : &apos; People of the Book ! You are not upon anything until you establish the Torah , the Gospel , and what has been sent down to you from your Lord . &apos;
Surely what has been revealed to you from your Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and unbelief ; so do not grieve for the unbelieving people .
Those who believe , and the Jews , and the Sabians , and the Christians , whoever believes in Allah and does good , they shall have no fear , nor shall they grieve .
Certainly We made a covenant with the children of Israel and We sent to them apostles ; whenever there came to them an apostle with that which their souls did not desire , some of them they called liars and some they slew .
And they thought there would be no punishment , so they became blind and deaf .
Then Allah turned to them in forgiveness ; then many of them became blind and deaf ; and Allah is Seeing what they do .
They are unbelievers who say : &apos; Allah is the Messiah , the son of Mary &apos; But the Messiah said : &apos; Children of Israel , worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord .
Whoever associates others with Allah , Allah has forbidden him Paradise , and his refuge shall be the Fire , and the wrongdoers will have no helpers .
Assuredly they disbelieve who say : God is the third of the three ; and there is no god but the One God .
And if they do not withdraw from what they say - then indeed , there will be for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment .
Will they not turn to Allah in repentance and ask for His forgiveness ?
And Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
The Messiah , Jesus son of Mary , was only a Messenger ; Messengers before him passed away .
His mother was a virtuous woman ; they both used to eat food .
See how We make the Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) clear to them , yet see how they are deluded away ( from the truth ) .
Say , &quot; Do you , instead of God , worship something that has no power to harm or benefit you ? &quot;
God is the Hearer , the Knower .
Say ( O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him ) , “ O People given the Book ( s ) ! Do not wrongfully commit injustice in your religion , and do not follow the desires of people who went astray before , and led many astray , and wandered far away from the Straight Path . ”
Cursed were the unbelievers of the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and Jesus , son of Mary ; that , because they disobeyed and were defiantly disobedient .
They did not forbid one another from the evil they committed ; certainly evil was what they did .
You will see many of them taking the unbelievers as their allies .
Evil indeed is that which their souls have sent on before them . They have incurred the Wrath of Allah , and in the torment they will abide .
Had they believed in God , the Prophet , and in what was revealed to him , they would not have taken them for friends , but many of them are evildoers .
Of all men you will find the Jews and those who associate others with Allah in His divinity to be the most hostile to those who believe ; and surely you will find the nearest of them in affection to those who believe ( to be ) those who say : We are Christians ; this is because there are priests and monks among them and because they are not proud .
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Apostle , you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they recognize , they say : Our Lord ! we believe , so write us down with the witnesses of the truth .
And why should we not believe in Allah and in the truth which has come to us ? And we aspire that our Lord will admit us among the righteous . &quot;
So because of what they said , Allah rewarded them with gardens &#91; in Paradise &#93; beneath which rivers flow .
They shall abide in it forever ; that is the recompense of the good-doers .
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those are the companions of Hellfire .
O you who believe ! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you , and do not exceed the limits .
Indeed , Allah does not like transgressors .
Eat of what God has given you , lawful and good ; and fear God , in whom you believe .
Allah will not call you to account for what is vain in your oaths , but He will call you to account for the making of deliberate oaths ; so its expiation is the feeding of ten poor persons with the average of what you feed your families , or their clothing , or the freeing of a slave .
Anyone who lacks the means shall fast for three days .
That is the expiation of your oaths when ye have sworn .
But guard your oaths .
Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you so that you may give thanks .
O you who believe ! Intoxicants , gambling , idolatry , and divining arrows are abominations of Satan ’ s doing .
Avoid them so that you may prosper .
Satan only wants to provoke strife and hatred among you through intoxicants and gambling , and to prevent you from the remembrance of God , and from prayer .
Will you then turn away ?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger , and beware ( of evil ) .
But if you turn away from it , then know that Our Messenger &apos;s duty is only to deliver the message clearly .
There is no blame on those who believe and do righteous deeds for what they may have eaten &#91; in the past &#93; , so long as they are Godwary and faithful and do righteous deeds , and are further Godwary and faithful , and are further Godwary and virtuous ; and Allah loves the doers .
O ye who believe ! Allah will surely test you with some game which will be well within reach of your hands and your lances , that Allah may know him who feareth Him in secret .
Whoever transgresses thereafter will have a painful punishment .
O you who believe ! Do not kill game while you are on pilgrimage .
And whoever of you kills intentionally - the penalty is an equivalent from cattle from what he killed , as adjudged by two just men among you , as an offering to be brought to the Ka &apos;bah , or an expiation the feeding of the needy , or the equivalent of that in fasting , that he may taste the consequence of his deed .
Allah has excused what is already past ; but whoever returns &#91; to violation &#93; , Allah will take retribution from him .
And Allah is Exalted in Might , Lord of Retribution .
It is lawful for you to hunt from the sea and to eat from it , as food for you and for the travellers , but forbidden to you is the game of the land as long as you are in pilgrim sanctity .
And fear Allah , to Whom you shall be gathered back .
Allah has made the Ka &apos;bah , the Sacred House , an asylum of security and Hajj and &apos; Umrah ( pilgrimage ) for mankind , and the Sacred Month and the animals of offerings and the garlanded ( animals , etc. marked with garlands on their necks made from the outer part of the stem of the Makkah ) , that you may know that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth , and that Allah is the All-Knower of everything .
Know that Allah is severe in punishment , and that Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
It is only for the Messenger to deliver the Message ; and God knows what you reveal and what you conceal .
Say , ‘ The bad and the good are not equal , though the abundance of the bad should amaze you . ’
So fear God , O men possessed of minds ; haply so you will prosper . &apos;
O ye who believe ! Ask not of things which , if disclosed to you , would trouble you ; but if ye ask of them while the Qur &apos;an is being revealed , they will be made plain to you .
Allah has pardoned that ; and Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing .
Before you , a people asked such questions , but they refused to believe in him .
Allah has not ordained aught of the bahirah or the sa &apos;ibah or the wasilah or the ham , those who disbelieve fabricate a lie against Allah , but most of them have no sense .
And when it is said to them , &quot; Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger , &quot; they say , &quot; Sufficient for us is what we found our fathers upon , &quot; and if their fathers had no knowledge or guidance , they were not guided .
O ye who believe !
He who goes astray cannot hurt you , if you are guided .
To Allah is the return of you all ; then He will inform you of what you used to do .
O ye who believe ! When death approaches any of you , ( take ) witnesses among yourselves when making a bequest , - two just men from among you , or two others from another folk , if ye are journeying through the land and the affliction of death befalls you .
Ye shall detain both after the prayer , and if ye doubt , they shall swear by Allah , &quot; We shall not be able to bring forth ( any ) near of kin , even though we be a kinsman . We shall not testify for the sake of Allah , for then indeed we should be of the sinful . &quot;
Then if it is known that the two were guilty of the sin , let two others stand forth in their place from among those who had said , and let them swear by Allah : verily our testimony is truer than the testimony of the two , for then verily we shall be of the wrong-doers .
That is more likely that they will give true testimony or else they will fear that other oaths would be taken after their oaths .
And fear Allah and listen ; and Allah does not guide the disobedient people .
On the Day when God will gather the messengers , and say , “ What response did you give ? ” They will say , “ We have no knowledge . You are the Knower of the unseen . ”
When Allah will say , &quot; O Jesus , son of Mary , remember My favor upon you and upon your mother ; how I supported you with the Holy Spirit and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity ; and how I taught you the Book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel ; and how you fashioned from clay the likeness of a bird , by My permission , and you breathed into it , and you healed the blind and the leprous by My permission ; and when you brought forth the dead by My permission ; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from &#91; killing &#93; you when you came to them with clear proofs , and when you brought them the disbelievers among them said , &quot; This is not but obvious magic . &quot;
And when I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and in My messenger , they said : We believe , and bear witness that verily we are Muslims .
When the disciples said , &apos; O Jesus son of Mary , is thy Lord able to send down for us a table from heaven ? &apos; He said , &apos; Fear God , if you are believers . &apos;
They said , “ We wish to eat from it , and our hearts be at rest , and to know that you have spoken the truth to us , and to bear witness to it . ”
Said Jesus , son of Mary , &apos; O God , our Lord , send down upon us a Table out of heaven , that shall be for us a festival , the first of us and the last of us , and a sign from Thee ; and provide for us ; Thou art the best of providers . &apos;
Allah said : verily I am going to send it down unto you , but whosoever of you thereafter disbelieveth , verily I shall torment him with a torment wherewith I shall not torment anyone in the world .
And when Allah will say : O Isa , son of Marium ! did you say to men : Take me and my mother for two gods besides Allah ?
No one can say what I have no right to say .
If I had said it , You would have known it .
You know what is in my soul , while I do not know what is within Yours .
You alone are the Knower of the unseen .
I did not say to them anything except what You commanded me : ‘ Worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord . ’
And I was a witness between them while I dwelt among them , but when You took me up , You were the Watcher over them , and You are Witness to all things .
If You punish them , they are Your servants ; but if You forgive them , You are the Almighty , the Wise . &quot;
Allah will say , &quot; This is a Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness .
For them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow , wherein they will abide forever .
Allah is well pleased with them , and they are well pleased with Him ; that is the great achievement .
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them , and He has power over all things .
All praise is due to Allah , Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light ; yet those who disbelieve equate others with their Lord .
It is He who created you from clay , and then decreed a term &#91; of life &#93; , and a term determined is with Him .
Yet you are still in doubt !
And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth .
He knows what you conceal and what you reveal , and He knows what you do .
And never does a sign come to them from the signs of their Lord , but they turn away from it .
For they denied the truth when it came to them ; but soon will come to them the news of what they used to ridicule .
Do they not see how many a generation We have destroyed before them , whom We had established in the earth such as We have not given to you , for We sent abundant rains from the sky for them , and made the rivers flow beneath them ? Yet We destroyed them for their sins , and raised up after them another generation .
And even if We had sent down to you a Book ( the Quran ) in which they were going to strike with their hands , the disbelievers would have said : &quot; This is nothing but evident sorcery ! &quot;
And they say : Why has not an angel been sent down to him ?
And if We had sent down an angel , the matter would have been decided ; then they would not have been respited .
And if We had made him an angel , We would certainly have made him as a mortal , and We would certainly have caused them confusion in that which they are wont to confound .
Mocked were ( many ) messengers before thee ; but their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked .
Say : Travel in the land and see what was the end of the rejecters .
Say , ‘ To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth ? ’
Say : &apos; God . &apos;
He has inscribed for Himself mercy .
He will surely gather you together to the Day of Resurrection , in which there is no doubt .
But those who have lost their souls do not believe .
To Him belongs all that dwells in the night and the day .
He is the Hearer , the Knower .
Say : Shall I take for a guardian any other than Allah , the Originator of the heavens and the earth ? He feedeth and is not fed .
Say : I am commanded that I should be the first of those who submit themselves ( to Allah ) , and be not of the polytheists .
Say : Surely I fear , if I disobey my Lord , the chastisement of a grievous day .
Whoever is spared of it on that Day — He had mercy on him ; that is the manifest triumph .
And if Allah touches you with harm , none can remove it but He ; and if He intends good for you , then He is Able to do what He wills .
He is the Omnipotent over His servants ; and He is the Wise , the Aware .
Say , &quot; What thing is more difficult for testimony ? &quot;
Say : Allah is my witness and your witness ; and this Quran has been revealed to me that I may warn you thereby and whomsoever it reaches .
Do you really bear witness that there are other gods besides God ? &quot;
Say , “ I do not testify . ”
Say , “ He is the One God , and I am innocent of what you worship . ”
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their sons ; but those who have lost their souls will not believe .
And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allah a lie or denies His verses ?
Indeed , the wrongdoers will not succeed .
And on the day when We shall gather them all together , We shall say to those who associated others with Allah in His Divinity : Where are your associates whom you asserted ?
Then they will have no excuse but to say : By Allah , our Lord , we never were polytheists .
See how they lie against themselves , and how they think that they have forsaken them !
And among them are some who listen to you , but We have placed over their hearts veils and heaviness in their ears , lest they understand not .
Even if they see every sign , they will not believe in it . When they come to you , the faithless say , ‘ This is nothing but myths of the ancients . ’
And they forbid it , and keep away from it .
But they ruin only their own souls ; yet they do not understand .
If thou couldst see when they are stationed before the Fire , and they will say , &apos; Would that we might return !
Then would we not reject the revelations of our Lord , but we would be among the believers ! &quot;
Indeed , what they were concealing before has become clear to them .
But if they were sent back , they would certainly return to that which they were forbidden , and most surely they are liars .
And they say , “ There is nothing but our life in this world , and we will not be resurrected . ”
If thou couldst see when they are stationed before their Lord !
They will say , &quot; Yes , by our Lord ! &quot;
He will say : &quot; Then taste the torment , because you used to disbelieve . &quot;
They are certainly losers who deny the encounter with God .
But when the Hour comes upon them suddenly , they will say , &quot; Woe to us that we have neglected it , &quot; and they will carry their burdens on their backs .
The life of this world is nothing but a sport and a pastime .
And certainly the abode of the hereafter is best for those who guard ( against evil ) .
Do you not exercise your reason ?
We know indeed that what they say grieves you ; and indeed it is not you they reject , but it is the signs of Allah that the unjust reject .
Apostles were certainly denied before you , but they were patient until Our help came to them .
There is none who can alter the words of Allah ; and there has already come to you the news of the apostles .
And if their aversion is grievous unto thee , then , if thou canst , seek out a way , or a ladder into the earth or a ladder unto the sky that thou mayst bring unto them a portent ( to convince them all ) !
So do not be one of the ignorant .
Only those who listen will respond .
As for those who are dead , God will raise them up , then unto Him they will be returned .
They say , &quot; Why has no sign been sent down to him from his Lord ? &quot;
Say : Surely Allah is able to send down a sign , but most of them do not know .
There is not an animal on the earth , nor a bird that flies on two wings , but are communities like you .
We have neglected nothing in the Book ( of Our decrees ) .
Then unto their Lord they will be gathered .
But those who deny Our revelations are deaf and dumb in darkness .
Allah leads astray whomever He wishes , and whomever He wishes He guides to a straight path .
Say : &apos; What think you ? If the chastisement of God comes upon you , or the Hour overtakes you , will you call upon any other than God , if you speak truly ? &apos;
Rather , to Him you will call , and He will remove what you invoke , if He wills , and you will forget what you associate &#91; with Him &#93; . &quot;
We sent messengers before you to other nations , then We seized them with misery and hardship , so that they might entreat &#91; Us &#93; .
So why did they not humble themselves when Our punishment came to them ?
But their hearts were hardened , and Satan made what they were doing seem fair to them .
So when they forgot what they had been reminded of , We opened the gates of all things , until , when they rejoiced in what they had received of , We seized them suddenly , and they were plunged into despair .
So the roots of the people who were unjust were cut off , and all praise is due to Allah , the Lord of the worlds .
Say , &quot; Have you considered : if Allah should take away your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts , who is the deity other than Allah who could restore them to you ? &quot;
See how variously We explain the Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) , yet they turn aside .
Say , ‘ Tell me , should Allah ’ s punishment overtake you suddenly or visibly , who will be destroyed except the wrongdoers ? ’
We send the messengers only as bearers of good news and as warners .
As for those who believe and reform , they will have no fear , nor will they grieve .
But those who reject Our Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) , the torment will touch them for their disbelief ( and for their belying the Message of Muhammad SAW ) .
Say : I do not say to you that I are with me the treasures of Allah , nor do I know the unseen , nor do I say to you that I am an angel ; I only follow that which is revealed to me .
Say , &quot; Are the same and the seeing alike ?
Will you not then reflect ? &quot;
And warn with it those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord , when they have no protector or intercessor besides Him , that they may guard ( against evil ) .
And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and in the evening , seeking His countenance .
You are not accountable for them , nor are they accountable for you .
You may drive them away , and thus become one of the wrongdoers .
And thus We have tried some of them with others , that they might say : Are these they whom Allah has favoured from amongst us ?
Does not Allah know best those who are grateful ?
And when those who believe in Our revelations come unto thee , say : Peace be unto you !
Your Lord has decreed for Himself mercy : if any of you does evil in ignorance , and thereafter repents , and makes amends , then He is Oft-forgiving , Most Merciful . &quot;
Thus do We elaborate the signs , that the wrongdoers may be known .
Say : I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon besides Allah .
Say : I will not follow your vain desires , for then should I go astray and I should not be of the rightly guided .
Say : &apos; I stand upon a clear sign from my Lord , and you have cried lies to it .
I do not have what you seek to hasten .
Judgment belongs only to God .
He relates the truth , and He is the best of judges . &quot;
Say : &apos; If what you seek to hasten were in my power , the matter between me and you would be decided ; and God knows very well the evildoers . &apos;
With Him are the keys of the unseen ; none knows them but He .
And He knows what is in the land and sea .
Not a leaf falleth but He knoweth it , and there is not a grain in the darkness of the earth , nor aught of fresh or dry but is in a Book luminous .
It is He who removes your souls at night , and knows what you commit by day ; then He raises you up during the day , so that the term may be completed .
Then to Him will be your return , whereat He will inform you concerning what you used to do .
And He it is Who has power over all His servants ; and He sends guardians over you till , when death comes to one of you , Our messengers take away his soul , and He does not waste anything .
Then they will be returned to Allah , their Lord .
Surely His is the judgment , and He is the swiftest of reckoners .
Say , ‘ Whoever delivers you from the land and the sea &#91; when &#93; you invoke Him in humility and privation , ‘ If He delivers us from this , we will surely be grateful . ’
Say , ‘ It is Allah who delivers you from it and from the distress , yet you ascribe partners to Him . ’
Say , “ He is Able to send punishment upon you from the sky , or from beneath your feet , or to divide you into different groups , and make you taste the harshness of one another . ”
See how We explain the Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) in various ways that they may understand .
Thy people have cried it lies , though it is the truth .
Say : I am not a guardian over you .
For every soul there is a &#91; preordained &#93; time , and soon you will know .
When you see those who plunge into Our verses , withdraw from them until they plunge into some other talk .
And if Satan should cause you to forget , then do not sit after the reminder with the wrongdoers .
The righteous are not accountable for them except &#91; only &#93; the reminder that perhaps they will be Godwary .
Leave alone those who have made their religion a sport and a pastime , and are deceived by the life of this world .
But remind with it , lest a soul be held in pledge for what it has earned .
No one will be able to intercede for them besides God . Even if it offers every equivalent , it will not be taken from it .
Those are they who are given up to destruction for their own deeds .
For them is drink of scalding water , and a painful punishment , because they used to disbelieve .
Say : &apos; Shall we call , apart from God , on that which neither profits nor hurts us , and shall we be turned back on our heels after God has guided us ? -- like one whom the Satans have blunders aimlessly in the earth , and his friends call him to the right path , &apos; Come to us . &apos;
Say , “ God ’ s guidance is the guidance , and we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds . ”
&#91; Saying &#93; , &quot; Maintain the prayer and be wary of Him , and it is He to whom you will be gathered . &quot;
It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth , and the day He says , ‘ Be , ’ and it is .
His saying is the truth , and His is the kingdom on the day when the Trumpet will be blown .
Knower of the Invisible and the Visible , He is the Wise , the Aware .
And when Abraham said to his father Azar : &apos; Do you take idols for gods ?
I see you and your people in absolute error &quot; .
And We showed Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth , that he might be of the number in the land .
So when the night covered him &#91; with darkness &#93; , he saw a star , and said , &quot; This is my Lord . &quot;
But when it went down , he said , &quot; I do not love those that set . &quot;
When he saw the moon rising in splendour , he said , &quot; This is my Lord . &quot;
But when it went down , he said : Unless my Lord guide me , I shall surely be of the erring ones .
Then , when he saw the sun rising , he said , &apos; This is my Lord ; this is greater ! &apos;
But when it set , he said , &quot; O my people , indeed I am not with what you associate .
Lo ! I have turned my countenance toward Him Who created the heavens and the earth , and I am not of the idolaters .
And his people argued with him ; he said , “ Are you arguing with me about God , when He has guided me ?
And I fear not that which ye associate with Him save aught that mine Lord may will ; my Lord comprehendeth everything in His knowledge ; in Him I shall put my trust .
Will ye not then be admonished ?
And how should I fear that which ye associate with Allah , when ye fear not to associate with Allah that for which He hath not sent down unto you ?
So which of the two parties has more right to security , if you should know ?
Those who have faith and do not mix their faith with wrongdoing — it is they who are the felicitous , and it is they who are the &#91; rightly &#93; guided .
This is Our argument which We gave to Abraham against his people .
We raise in rank whomever We will .
Indeed , your Lord is Wise and Knowing .
And We bestowed upon him Ishaq ( Isaac ) and Yaqub ( Jacob ) ; We guided all of them ; and We guided Nooh before them , and of his descendants Dawud and Sulaiman and Sulaiman and Ayyub and Yusuf and Moosa and Haroon .
Thus do We reward the doers of good .
And ( We guided ) Zakariya ( Zachariah ) and &apos; Iliyas ( Elias ) , each one of them was of the righteous .
And ( We guided ) Isma &apos;il ( Ishmael ) , Elisha ( Elisha ) , and Yunus ( Jonah ) , and Lout ( Lot ) , and each one of them We made their offspring among the &apos; Alamin ( mankind and jinns ) ( of their times ) .
And some of their forefathers and their offspring and their brethren ; and We chose them and guided them to the Straight Path .
That is the guidance of Allah by which He guides whom He wills of His servants .
And if they had been worshipping other than Allah , their deeds would have become worthless for them .
Those are the ones to whom We gave the Book and wisdom and prophethood .
And if these disbelieve therein ( the Book , Al-Hukm and Prophethood ) , then verily , We have entrusted it to a people ( such as the Companions of Prophet Muhammad SAW ) who are not disbelievers therein .
Those are they whom God has guided ; so follow their guidance .
Say , ‘ I do not ask you any reward for it .
It is nothing but a reminder to the worlds . &quot;
They did not value God as He should be valued , when they say , “ God did not reveal anything to any human being . ”
Say : Who revealed the Book which Musa brought , a light and a guidance to men , which you make into scattered writings which you show while you conceal much ? And you were taught that which you did not know , ( neither ) you nor your fathers .
Say : Allah ; then leave them to their play of plunging .
And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down , confirming that which was before it , that you may warn the Mother of Cities ( Makkah ) and those around it .
Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it , and they are watchful of their prayers .
Who is more unjust than one who invents falsehood against God or says , &quot; It has been revealed to me , &quot; while nothing has been revealed to him , or says , &quot; I will reveal the like of what God has revealed . &quot;
If you could only see the unjust in the agonies of death when the angels stretch out their hands , ( saying ) : &apos; Yield up your souls &apos; Today you shall be recompensed with a humiliating punishment for what you have said of Allah and for your being proud .
And now you have come to Us alone as We created you at first , and you have left what We have left behind you , and We do not see with you your intercessors whom you asserted that they were your associates in respect of you .
Now you have cut off from one another ( i.e. believers in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism ) and that which you asserted ( in the worldly life ) .
It is God who splits the grain and the date-stone , brings forth the living from the dead , and He is the one who brings forth the dead from the living .
That is God ; then how are you perverted ?
He causes the day to split forth , and He makes the night to rest , and the sun and the moon to reckon . That is the ordaining of the Mighty , the Knowing .
And He it is Who hath appointed for you the stars that ye may find your way by them in the darkness of the land and the sea .
Thus have We elaborated the signs for a people who have knowledge .
It is He who produced you from a single soul , then a lodging for you in the womb , and a lodging-place in the womb ; and We have made in it signs for a people who understand .
And He it is Who sends down water from the cloud , then We bring forth with it buds of all ( plants ) , then We bring forth from it green ( foliage ) from which We bring forth grain ; and out of the palm trees , of the sheaths of it , come forth clusters ( of dates ) within reach , and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates , alike and unlike .
Look at their fruits when they bear fruit and ripen !
Surely in that are signs for a people who believe .
And they have made the jinn associates of Allah , while He created them , and they impute to Him falsely without knowledge , sons and daughters .
Glory be to Him and exalted be He above what they describe .
Originator of the heavens and the earth , how can He have a son when He has no spouse ? He created all things and has knowledge of all things .
He is God , your Lord ; there is no god but He , the Creator of all things , so worship Him .
He is the Guardian of all things .
Vision perceives Him not , but He perceives &#91; all &#93; vision ; and He is the Subtle , the Acquainted .
Certainly , proofs have come to you from your Lord . So whoever sees , it is for &#91; the benefit of &#93; himself , and whoever is blind , it is to its detriment .
And I am not a guardian over you .
Thus do We elaborate the signs , so that they may say , ‘ You have studied , ’ and that We may clarify it for a people who have knowledge .
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord , there is no god except Him , and turn away from the polytheists .
And if Allah had willed , they would not have associated .
We have not made you a guardian over them , nor are you their guardian .
And do not abuse those whom they invoke besides Allah , lest they should abuse Allah out of spite , without any knowledge .
Thus have We made pleasing to every people their deeds .
Then to their Lord is their return , and He will inform them of what they used to do .
And they swear by Allah with the strongest of their oaths that if a sign came to them they would surely believe in it .
Say : &apos; Signs are only with God . &apos;
But what will make you realize that when it came they will not believe ? ”
And We will turn away their hearts and their eyes because they disbelieved in the first time , and We will leave them in their inordinacy , blindly wandering on .
Even if We sent down angels to them , and the dead spoke to them , and We gathered all things before them , they would not believe , unless God willed ; but most of them are ignorant .
And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy - devils from mankind and jinn .
They would not have done so ; so leave them to their forging .
And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it , and that they may be pleased with it , and that they may earn what they earn .
Shall I then seek a judge other than Allah ?
And those to whom We have given the Book know that it is revealed from your Lord with the truth , so be not you ( O Muhammad SAW ) of the Mushrikun ( polytheists , pagans , idolaters , pagans , disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah , etc . ) .
And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and justice .
No one can change His words , and He is the Hearing , the Knowing .
And if you obey most of those in the earth , they will lead you astray from the way of Allah ; they follow nothing but conjecture and they only make guesses .
Surely your Lord knows best those who stray from His way , and He knows best those who are guided .
So eat that over which the name of Allah has been mentioned , if you are believers in His verses .
Why should you not eat of that over which the Name of God has been mentioned , when He has already made plain to you what He has forbidden you , unless you are constrained to it ?
And indeed many lead astray by their own desires through ignorance .
Indeed , your Lord is most knowing of the transgressors .
And eschew the open and the secret .
Those who commit sin will be requited for what they used to earn .
And eat not of that whereon the name of Allah hath not been pronounced ; verily that is a transgression .
And indeed the Shayatin ( devils ) do inspire their friends ( from mankind ) to dispute with you , and if you obey them , then you will be Mushrikun ( polytheists - see V. 2 : 105 ) .
Is he who was dead , and We gave him life , and appointed for him a light to walk by among the people , like him who is in utter darkness from which he cannot emerge ?
Thus the doings of disbelievers are made to appear good to them .
And thus have We made in every town the great ones to be its guilty ones , that they may plan therein ; and they do not plan but against their own souls , and they do not perceive .
And when a sign comes to them , they say : We will not believe until we are given the like of what Allah &apos;s apostles are given .
Allah knows best with whom to place His Message .
Humiliation from Allah , and a severe torment will afflict the criminals for their scheming .
And whomsoever Allah wills to guide , He expands his breast to Islam ; and whomsoever He wills to send astray , He makes his breast closed and constricted , as if he were climbing towards the sky .
That is how God places punishment on those who do not believe .
And this is the path of thy Lord , leading straight ; and We have detailed the signs for a people who remember .
For them is a home of peace with their Lord , and He is their Protector .
And on the day when He shall gather them all together , He will say : O you assembly of jinn ! You have indeed made much of mankind .
And their adherents among mankind will say , &quot; Our Lord , some of us made use of others , but we have &#91; now &#93; reached our term , which You determined for us . &quot;
He will say : &quot; The Fire be your dwelling-place : you will dwell therein for ever , except as Allah wills .
Indeed , your Lord is Wise and Knowing .
So We make some of the wrongdoers befriend others because of what they used to earn .
&quot; O ye assembly of Jinns and men ! did there not come to you messengers from among you , relating to you My Verses , and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours ? &quot;
They will say , &quot; We testify against ourselves . &quot;
The worldly life deceived them . They will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers .
This is because your Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly while their people were warned .
Each one has its own deeds ; and your Lord is not seeing their deeds .
Your Lord is the Rich , the Owner of Mercy .
If He wills , He can take you away , and replace you with what is pleasing to Him , as He produced you from the seed of another .
Verily that which ye are promised is sure to arrive , and ye cannot escape .
Say , &quot; O people , work according to your position ; &#91; for &#93; indeed , I am working .
Soon you will know in whose favour the outcome of that abode will be . &quot;
Verily , the Zalimun ( polytheists and wrong-doers , etc . ) will not be successful .
And they appoint for Allah , of the tilth and cattle that He hath produced , a portion , they say according to their fancy : this is for Allah , and this for our associate-gods ; then that which is for their associate-gods reacheth not Allah , while that which is for Allah reacheth their associate-gods .
Evil is what they judge .
Likewise , their associates have made the slaying of their children seem decorous to many of the polytheists , in order to lead them to their ruin , and to confuse their faith .
Had God willed , they would not have done so ; so leave them to their forging .
And they say : These cattle and tilth are taboo none shall eat thereof save whom we allow , so that they assert , and there are cattle whose backs are forbidden , and cattle over which they mention not the name of Allah , fabricating a lie against Allah .
Soon He will requite them for what they invent .
And they say : whatsoever is in the bellies of such cattle is for our males alone and is forbidden unto our women , and if it be born dead , they all are partakers thereof .
He will recompense them for their describing .
Indeed , He is Wise and Knowing .
Losers are they who kill their children foolishly , without knowledge , and forbid what God has provided for them , forging against God a lie .
Indeed , they have gone astray , and they are not &#91; rightly &#93; guided .
It is He who produces gardens , trellised and untrellised , and date-palms , and crops of different shape and olives and pomegranates , similar and dissimilar .
Eat of its fruit when it fruiteth , and pay the due thereof on the day of its harvest , and be not prodigal ; verily He approveth not the wasters .
Among the livestock are some for carrying burdens .
Eat of that which Allah hath given you , and follow not the footsteps of the Satan ; verily he is Unto you an enemy manifest .
Eight pairs : two of sheep , and two of goats .
Say : &apos; Is it the two males He has forbidden , or the two females , or what the wombs of the two females contain ?
Tell me with knowledge , if you are truthful . &quot;
Of camels two , of oxen two . Say : &apos; Is it the two males He has forbidden you , or the two females , or what the wombs of the two females contain ?
Were you then so waiting when Allah enjoined this upon you ? ”
So who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against Allah in order to mislead people without knowledge ?
Lo ! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk .
Say : I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to him who eats it , unless it be carrion , or blood poured forth , or the flesh of swine -- that is an abomination -- or an abomination , other than that of God &apos;s name has been invoked .
But if anyone is driven by necessity , without wilful disobedience , nor transgressing due limits , - thy Lord is Oft-Forgiving , Most Merciful .
For the Jews We forbade every animal with claws ; and of oxen and sheep We forbade them their fat , except what is on their backs or their entrails , or what is mixed with a bone .
Thus did We requite them for their rebellion , and indeed , We are truthful .
So if they deny you , &#91; O Muhammad &#93; , say , &quot; Your Lord is the possessor of vast mercy . And never will His penalty be averted from the people of the defiantly disobedient . &quot;
The polytheists will say , “ Had God willed , neither we nor our forefathers would have associated anything with Him , nor would we have given anything . ”
Likewise belied those who were before them , until they tasted Our wrath .
Say , &quot; Have you any knowledge ?
Then bring it forth to us .
But you follow nothing but conjecture , and you do nothing but surmise . ”
Say , &quot; God alone has the conclusive proof .
Had He willed , He would have guided you all . &quot;
Say : &apos; Produce your witnesses who testify God has forbidden this . &apos;
If they testify , do not testify with them . And do not follow the desires of those who deny Our revelations , and those who do not believe in the Hereafter and equate others with their Lord .
Say , ‘ Come , I will recite what your Lord has forbidden you : that you shall not ascribe any partners to Him , and that you shall be good to parents , and that you shall not kill your children because of penury — We provide for you and for them — you shall not approach indecencies , whether outward or inward , and that you do not kill the life which Allah has made sacred , except in the course of justice .
This is what He has enjoined upon you so that you may exercise your reason .
And do not approach the property of an orphan except in the best manner , until he reaches his maturity , and give full measure and weight with justice .
We charge no soul with more than it can bear .
And when you speak , be just , even if it should be a near relative , and fulfill the covenant of Allah .
This is what He commands you so that you may take heed . &quot;
And this is My path , leading straight : follow it : follow not ( other ) paths , for they will scatter you away from His Path .
This is what He enjoins upon you so that you may be Godwary . ’
Then We gave Moses the Book , completing &#91; Our favour &#93; to the virtuous , explaining all things clearly , as guidance and mercy , so that they might believe in the encounter with their Lord .
And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down ; so follow it , and guard yourselves against evil , that mercy may be shown to you .
Lest you should say : &apos; The Book was sent down to two nations before us , and we have no knowledge of their tiding . &apos;
Or lest ye should say : If only the Book had been revealed unto us , we should surely have been better guided than they .
Now hath come unto you a clear ( Sign ) from your Lord , and a guidance and a mercy .
So who is more unjust than one who denies the signs of Allah and turns away from them ?
We will surely afflict those who turn away from Our signs with the worst of punishment , because of their turning away .
Are they waiting for the angels or your Lord to come to them , or for some of your Lord &apos;s signs to come ?
On the Day when some of your Lord ’ s signs come , no soul will benefit from its faith unless it had believed previously , or had earned some goodness through his faith .
Say , &quot; Wait , we too are waiting . &quot;
As for those who divided their religion into parts and became sects , you have nothing to do with them .
Their affair is with Allah ; then He will inform them of what they did .
Whoever comes &#91; on the Day of Judgement &#93; with a good deed will have ten times its like , and whoever brings an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof ; and they will not be wronged .
Say : Surely my Lord has guided me to the right path , the right path , the faith of Ibrahim the upright one , and he was not of the polytheists .
Say : &apos; My prayer , my rites of sacrifice , my living , my dying -- all belongs to God , the Lord of all Being .
He has no partner with Him , so &#91; it is &#93; commanded me , and I am the first of those who submit . &quot;
Say : Shall I seek a Lord other than Allah , when He is the Lord of all things ?
And no soul earns except against itself , and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another .
Then to your Lord is your return , and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ .
It is He who has made you successors on the earth , and raised some of you in rank above others , that He may try you in what He has given you .
Lo ! verily thy Lord is swift in prosecution and lo ! verily He is Forgiving , Merciful .
Alif-Lam-Mim-Sad . &#91; These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran and none but Allah ( Alone ) knows their meanings &#93; .
( This is ) a Book ( the Quran ) sent down to you ( O Muhammad SAW ) , so be not distressed because of it ( the disbelievers ) , and warn ( them ) , and a Reminder for the believers .
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord , and follow no masters other than Him .
Little is the admonition that you take !
And how many a township have We destroyed , upon them Our torment came at night or while they were taking their midday rest .
Their only cry was , when Our might came upon them , that they said , &apos; We were evildoers . &apos;
We shall question those to whom Our message was sent , and those through whom We sent it .
Then We will narrate to them with knowledge , for We were never absent .
And the weighing &#91; of deeds &#93; on that Day is the truth .
Those whose scales are heavy shall prosper .
But those whose scales are light are those who have lost their souls , because they have gone against Our revelations .
And assuredly We established you in the earth and appointed for you livelihood therein ; yet little thanks ye return .
And certainly We created you , then We fashioned you , then We said to the angels : Prostrate yourselves before Adam , and they fell prostrate ; not so Iblis ; he was not of those who make prostration .
God asked , &quot; What prevented you from prostrating yourself when I commanded you to ? &quot;
He said , &quot; I am better than him .
You created me from fire , but You created him from clay . &quot;
( Allah ) said : &quot; Get thee down from this : it is not for thee to be arrogant here .
Go forth , therefore , surely you are of the abject ones .
He said , “ Give me respite till the Day they are resurrected . ”
He said , “ You are granted respite . ”
He said : Because Thou hast sent me astray , surely I will sit in ambush for them on Thy straight path .
Then I will come upon them from before them and from behind them and from the right and from the left , and You will not find most of them appreciative . &quot;
( Allah ) said : &quot; Get out from here , disgraced and expelled .
Whoever of them follows you — I will fill up Hell with you all . ”
&quot; O Adam ! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden , and enjoy ( its good things ) as ye wish : but approach not this tree , lest ye become wrong-doers . &quot;
But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to them that he might reveal to them that which was hidden from them of their shame , he said : Your Lord did not forbid you this tree but that you may not both become angels or that you may abide in it .
And he swore to them , &quot; Indeed , I am to you a trustworthy adviser . &quot;
Thus he misled them with deception .
And when they tasted of the tree , their shame became manifest to them , and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden , and their Lord called out to them : Did I not forbid you from this tree and say to you : Surely the Shaitan is your open enemy ?
They said , &quot; Our Lord , we have wronged ourselves , and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us , we will surely be among the losers . &quot;
He said , “ Go down , one of you an enemy to the other ; and for a fixed time you shall stay on earth , and feed in it . ”
He said : Therein shall you live , and therein you shall die , and from it you shall be brought forth .
O Children of Adam ! We have given you a garment to cover your shame and as an adornment ; and the garment of piety - that is the best .
This is the revelations of God , so that they may take heed .
O Children of Adam ! Let not Satan seduce you , as he got your parents out of the Garden , stripping them of their garments to show them their shameful parts .
Lo ! he seeth you , he and his hosts , from whence ye see them not .
Lo ! We have made the devils friends of those who believe not .
And when they commit an indecency they say : We found our fathers doing this , and Allah has enjoined it on us .
Say : Surely Allah does not enjoin indecency .
Tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not ?
Say : &apos; My Lord has commanded justice ; and set your faces at every time of prayer , and call upon Him , making your religion His sincerely .
As He brought you into being , so will you return ( to Him ) . &quot;
A group &#91; of you &#93; He has guided , and upon another group was &#91; incited &#93; error , so they took the devils as allies instead of Allah , while they thought that they were guided .
O Children of Adam ! Eat of every place of worship , and drink , but waste not ; verily He approveth not the wasters .
Say : Who has forbidden the good things of Allah which He has brought forth for His servants and the good things of sustenance ?
Say , “ They are for the believers in this world , but exclusively for them on the Day of Resurrection . ”
Thus do We elaborate the signs for a people who have knowledge .
Say : My Lord has only forbidden indecencies , the outward and the inward ones , and that you should associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority , and that you should attribute ( to Allah ) something of which you do not know .
To every nation a term ; when their term comes they shall not delay it by a single hour , nor shall they hasten it .
O children of Adam ! If there come to you apostles from among you relating to you My communications , then whoever shall guard ( against evil ) and do good , they shall have no fear , nor shall they grieve .
But those who reject Our Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) and treat them with arrogance , they will be the dwellers of the Fire , to dwell therein forever .
Who is more unjust than one who invents falsehood against God or rejects His revelations ?
For such their appointed portion ( of the Book ) is their portion of the Book , until when Our messengers come unto them to cause them to die , and they say : Where is that which ye were wont to invoke beside Allah ?
They will say , &quot; We have no power to do so , &quot; and they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers .
He will say : &apos; Enter the Fire and join the nations of jinn and humans that have gone before you . &apos;
Every time a group enters , it curses its sister-nation ; until , when they have all come up with one another into it , the last of them will say to the first of them , “ Our Lord , these led us astray ; so give them double the punishment of the Fire . ”
He will say : &quot; Each one has a double ( punishment ) , but you do not know . &quot;
And the first will say to the last : &quot; Then you did no good before us , so taste the torment for what you used to earn . &quot;
Verily , those who belie Our Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) and treat them with arrogance , for them the gates of heaven will not be opened , nor will they enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle ( which is impossible ) .
Thus do We reward the criminals .
They shall have a bed of hell-fire and from above them coverings ( of it ) .
Thus do We reward the wrongdoers .
But those who believe and do righteous deeds - We do not burden any soul beyond its wealth . They are the companions of Paradise ; they will abide therein eternally .
We shall remove whatever rancour there is in their hearts .
Rivers shall flow beneath them , and they shall say : &apos; Praise belongs to Allah who has guided us to this .
We would not have found the way had God not guided us .
Indeed , the messengers of our Lord did come with truth . &quot;
And it will be proclaimed to them , “ This is the Garden you have inherited for what you used to do . ”
The inhabitants of Paradise will call out to the inhabitants of the Fire : &apos; We have found what our Lord promised us to be true .
Have you , too , found what your Lord promised you to be true ? &quot;
They will say : Yea , verily .
Then a crier will announce in between them , &quot; The curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers ,
who bar from God &apos;s way , desiring to make it crooked ; they do not believe in the world to come . &apos;
And between the two there will be a veil , and on the Heights will be men who will recognise them all by their faces ; and they will call out to the people of Paradise , “ Peace be upon you ” ; they have not yet entered Paradise , although they hope .
And when their eyes are turned towards the companions of the Fire , they say , &quot; Our Lord , do not place us among the wrongdoing people . &quot;
And the dwellers on the Heights will call out to the people whom they will recognize by their marks , “ What you have not brought into being , nor what you were conceited ? ”
Are these they of whom ye swore that Allah would not show them mercy ?
Enter Paradise ; you shall have nothing to fear , nor shall you grieve .
And the dwellers of the Fire will call to the dwellers of Paradise : &quot; Pour on us some water or anything that Allah has provided you with . &quot;
They will say , “ God has forbidden them to the disbelievers . ”
who have taken their religion as a diversion and an amusement , and whom the worldly life has deluded . &quot;
So today We will forget them as they forgot the meeting of this their Day , and as they used to impugn Our signs .
And indeed We have brought to them a Book which We have well distinguished , except with knowledge , and a mercy for people who believe .
Are they waiting for anything but its fulfillment ?
On the Day when its fulfillment comes true , those who disregarded it before will say , “ The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring the truth .
Have we then any intercessors to intercede for us ?
Or could we be sent back ( to the first life of the world ) so that we may do ( evil ) deeds other than those ( evil ) deeds which we did ? &quot;
They will ruin their souls , and what they used to fabricate has forsaken them .
Lo ! your Lord is Allah , Who created the heavens and the earth in six days , and then established Himself on the Throne ( of Authority ) : He draweth the night as a veil , the day , ( and ) He created the sun and the moon and the stars subservient by His command .
His is the creation , His is the command .
Blessed be Allah , the Lord of the Worlds !
Pray to your Lord with humility and in secret .
Lo ! He loveth not transgressors .
And do not cause corruption on the earth after its reformation , and invoke Him in fear and hope .
Lo ! the mercy of Allah is nigh unto those who do good .
It is He who looses the winds , bearing good tidings before His mercy , till , when they bear a heavy cloud , We drive them to a dead land , and We send down water upon it , and bring forth with it fruits of every kind .
Even so We bring forth the dead ; haply you will remember .
And the good land -- its vegetation comes forth by the leave of its Lord , and the corrupt -- it comes forth but scantily .
Even so We turn about the signs for a people who are thankful .
We sent Noah to his people , and he said , &apos; O my people , serve God , you have no god other than Him ; surely I fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day . &apos;
The chiefs of his people said : Most surely we see you in manifest error .
&#91; Noah &#93; said , &quot; O my people , there is no error in me , but I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds . &quot;
I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and I advise you sincerely , and I know from Allah what you do not know .
Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you , that he may warn you , so that you may fear God , and so that you may be shown mercy ? &apos;
In response they denied him , so We rescued him and those with him in the ship , and drowned those who denied Our signs ; indeed they were a blind group .
And to &apos; Ad &#91; We sent &#93; their brother Hud .
He said , &quot; O my people , worship Allah ; you have no deity other than Him .
Will ye not ward off ( evil ) ?
The disbelieving assembly of his nation said : &apos; We see you in foolishness , and think that you are one of the liars&apos;
He said : O my people ! there is no folly in me , but I am an apostle from the Lord of the worlds .
I deliver to you the messages of my Lord , and I am a trustworthy adviser to you .
Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you that he may warn you ?
And remember when He made you successors after the people of Noah , and increased you amply in stature .
Remember the favours of Allah , that ye may prosper .
They said , &quot; Have you come to make us worship God alone and abandon what our fathers worshipped ?
Then bring upon us what you promise us , if you are truthful . &quot;
He said : Surely the chastisement and the wrath of your Lord have already fallen upon you .
Dispute ye with me over names which ye have named , ye and your fathers , for which Allah hath sent down no warranty ?
Wait and I too will be waiting with you . &quot;
Then We delivered him and those who were with him by Our mercy , and We cut off the last remnant of those who cried lies to Our signs and were not believers .
And to Thamud &#91; We sent &#93; their brother Salih .
He said , &quot; O my people , worship Allah ; you have no deity other than Him .
Indeed , there has come to you a clear sign from your Lord . This she-camel of Allah is a sign for you .
So leave her alone to graze on God &apos;s earth , and do not harm her , lest a painful chastisement should seize you . &apos;
Remember when He made you successors to the &apos; Ad , and settled you in the land . You built palaces on its plains , and carve out dwellings in the mountains .
So remember God ’ s blessings , and do not roam the earth spreading turmoil .
The elite of his people who were arrogant said to those who were oppressed — those among them who had faith , ‘ Did you really be sent from his Lord ? ’
They said : Lo ! in that wherewith he hath been sent we are believers .
The arrogant ones said , &quot; We reject what you believe in &quot; .
So they hamstrung the she-camel and defied the command of their Lord , and said , “ O Saleh , bring upon us what you promise us , if you are one of the messengers . ”
Thereupon the earthquake seized them , and morning found them prostrate in their dwellings .
Then he turned away from them and said : O my people ! surely I delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you good advice , but you love not good counsellors .
And Lot , when he said to his people , &apos; What , do you commit a Messenger such as never any being in the world ever committed before you ?
You approach men lustfully instead of women .
Indeed , you are a transgressing lot . ’
Then the answer of his people was naught save that they said : drive them forth from your city , verily they are a people who would be pure !
But We saved him and his family , except his wife ; she was one of those who remained behind .
And We rained upon them a rain &#91; of stones &#93; .
Then see what was the end of the Mujrimun ( disbelievers , polytheists , sinners , criminals , etc . ) .
And to the Madyan &#91; We sent &#93; their brother Shu &apos;ayb .
He said , &quot; O my people , worship Allah ; you have no deity other than Him .
Indeed a clear proof has come to you from your Lord , so give full measure and weight and do not cheat the people of their rights , and do not spread corruption in the land after its reform .
That is better for you , if you are believers .
And do not lie in wait in every path , threatening and turning away from Allah &apos;s way those who believe in Him , and seeking to make it crooked .
Remember how you were few , and He multiplied you .
And see how was the end of the Mufsidun ( mischief-makers , corrupts , etc . ) .
And if there are among you those who believe in that with which I have been sent and others who disbelieve , then be patient until Allah judges between us , and He is the best of judges .
The elite of his people who were arrogant said , ‘ O Shu ‘ ayb , we will expel you and the faithful who are with you from our town , should you return to our creed . ’
He said , &quot; Even if we should not be able to do so ?
“ We shall then have fabricated a lie against Allah if we return to your religion after Allah has rescued us from it ; and it is not for us to return to your religion except if Allah , Who is our Lord wills ; the knowledge of our Lord encompasses all things ; O our Lord ! decide between us and our people with truth ; and You are the best of deciders . ”
And the eminent among his people who disbelieved said , &quot; If you should follow Shu &apos;ayb , indeed , you would be losers . &quot;
Thereupon the earthquake seized them , and morning found them prostrate in their dwellings .
Those who belied Shu &apos;aib became as though they had never dwelt therein ; those who belied Shu &apos;aib , they were the losers .
And he turned away from them , and said , &apos; O my people , I have delivered to you the Messages of my Lord , and advised you sincerely .
So how should I grieve for a faithless lot ? ’
Never did We send a Prophet to a town , but We seized its people with distress and affliction in order that they might humble themselves .
Then We changed the evil for good , until they grew affluent and said : even so grief and afflicted our fathers .
Then We seized them suddenly while they were unaware .
And if the people of the towns had believed and feared Allah , We would certainly have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth , but they rejected , so We seized them for what they earned .
Are the people of the cities secure that Our punishment will not come upon them at night while they are asleep ?
Or are the people of the townships secure that Our wrath will not come upon them while they are at play ?
Are they then secure against the contrivance of Allah ?
But no one can feel secure against the design of God , except the people of the lost .
Do not regard those who inherit the earth from its &#91; previous &#93; inhabitants , that if We will , We can smite them for their sins , and set a seal upon their hearts , so they do not hear ?
Those were the towns whose story We relate to you .
And assuredly there came unto them their apostles with evidences , but they were not such as to believe that which they had belied afore .
Thus does Allah seal the hearts of the disbelievers .
We found most of them untrue to their covenants ; but most of them We found ungodly .
Then , after them , We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his Council , but they rebelled against them .
So see how was the end of the Mufsidun ( mischief-makers , corrupts , etc . ) .
And Moses said : &apos; Pharaoh , I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds .
It behoves me not to say aught of God save the truth ; I have come to you from your Lord with a clear sign ; so let the Children of Israel go with me . &apos;
He said , “ If you have come with a sign , then present it , if you are truthful . ”
So he threw down his staff , and behold , it was a serpent , plain ( for all to see ) !
Then he drew out his hand , and behold , it was white to all beholders !
The chiefs of Fir &apos;aun &apos;s ( Pharaoh ) people said : &quot; Verily ! This is indeed a sorcerer well-versed .
He wants to expel you from your land .
What is your counsel ? &quot;
They said , &apos; Warn him and his brother a while , and send among the cities musterers ,
That they may bring unto thee every magician knowing .
And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh , saying , &apos; We shall surely have a wage , if we should be the victors ? &apos;
He said , &quot; Yes , and you are of those near &#91; to me &#93; . &quot;
They said : &quot; O Moses ! Either you throw ( first ) , or shall we have the ( first ) throw ? &quot;
He said , &quot; You will throw . &quot;
So when they threw , they bewitched the eyes of the people , and struck terror into them , and produced a great &#91; feat of &#93; magic .
And We inspired Musa ( Moses ) ( saying ) : &quot; Throw your stick , &quot; and behold ! it swallowed up all the falsehoods which they showed !
Thus was the truth established , and their works became vain .
So they were vanquished there , and they went back retreating .
And the magicians fell down in prostration &#91; to Allah &#93; .
saying : &apos; We believe in the Lord of the Worlds ,
the Lord of Moses and Aaron . &quot;
Said Pharaoh , &apos; You have believed him before I gave you leave .
Surely , this is a plot which you have plotted in the city to expel its people from it , but you shall come to know .
Surely I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides , then I will crucify you all . &apos;
They said , “ Then to our Lord we will return . ”
You will take revenge on us only because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us .
Our Lord , grant us patience and let us die as submitters ( Muslims ) &apos;
The elite of Pharaoh ’ s people said , ‘ Will you leave Moses and his people to cause corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods ? ’
Moses said to his people , &quot; Seek help from God and be patient .
The earth is God &apos;s earth ; He bequeathes it to whomsoever He will of His servants ; and the issue ultimate is for the godfearing . &apos;
They said , “ We have been tormented before you came to us , and after you have come to us . ”
He said , &quot; Your Lord may well destroy your enemy and grant you authority in the land . Then He will see what you do . &quot;
And We punished Pharaoh &apos;s people with years of drought and scarcity of fruit , that haply they might remember .
But when good came to them , they said : &apos; This is our due &apos; And when evil afflicted them , they attributed it to the misfortune of Moses and those with him .
Assuredly their ill fortune was only with Allah , but most of them know not .
And they said , “ What sign you bring us , to bewitch us with , we will not believe in you . ”
So We sent against them the flood and the locusts and the lice and the frogs and the blood - clear signs - but they were arrogant and were a people given to sin .
Whenever a plague struck them , they said , &quot; Moses , pray to your Lord for us by virtue of the promise He has made to you .
If you remove the plague from us , we will certainly believe in you , and we will let the Children of Israel go with you . &quot;
But when We lifted the plague from them , for a term which they had to fulfill , behold , they broke their promise .
So We punished them and drowned them in the sea , because they belied Our Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) and were not humiliated .
And We made the people , who were oppressed , inherit the eastern parts of the land , and the western parts which We had blessed .
And the Word of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of their endurance ; and We annihilated all that Pharaoh and his people had built and all that they had built .
And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea , and they came upon a people who were devoted to their idols , and they said , “ O Moses , make for us a god , as they have gods . ”
He said , “ You are indeed an unaware people . ”
As for these , their works are in vain and their works are vain .
He said : Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah , when He hath favoured you above ( all ) creatures ?
And ( remember ) when We delivered you from Pharaoh &apos;s folk who were afflicting you with the worst torment , killing your sons and sparing your women .
And in that was a great trial from your Lord .
And We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights , and completed them with ten &#91; more &#93; , so the term of his Lord was completed forty nights .
And Moses said to his brother Aaron : &apos; Take me among my people , and be upright , and do not follow the way of the mischief-makers . &apos;
And when Musa ( Moses ) came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him , he said : &quot; O my Lord !
He said : Thou shalt not see Me , but look upon the mountain ; if it return to its place , then thou shalt see Me .
So when his Lord appeared to the mountain , He made it crumble to dust , and Moses fell down in a swoon .
And when he recovered , he said , “ Glory be to You , I repent to You , and I am the first of the believers . ”
He said : O Musa ! verily I have chosen thee above mankind by My messages and by My speaking ; so hold that which I have vouchsafed unto thee , and be of the thankful .
And We wrote for him on the Tablets the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation of all things ( and said ) : Hold it fast , and command thy people to follow the best thereof .
Soon I shall show you the abode of the wrongdoers .
And I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant in the land without any right , so that even if they see all the signs , they will not believe in them ; and if they see the path of righteousness , they will not adopt it as the way ; and if they see the way of error , they will adopt it as a way .
This is because they rejected Our revelations and did not pay heed to them .
And ( as for ) those who disbelieve in Our communications and the meeting of the hereafter , their deeds are null .
Are they requited aught save what they used to do ?
The people of Moses made , in his absence , out of their ornaments , the image of calf , ( for worship ) .
Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to any way ?
They took it &#91; for worship &#93; , and they were wrongdoers .
And when they became remorseful and realised that they had gone astray , they said , “ If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us , we will surely be of the losers . ”
And when Moses returned to his people , angry and grieved , he said , &apos; Evil is that you have done in my place in my absence .
Would you hasten on the edict of your Lord ? ’
And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head , dragging him toward him .
&#91; Aaron &#93; said , &quot; Son of my mother , indeed the people oppressed me and were about to kill me .
So let not the enemies rejoice over me , and do not place me among the wrongdoing lot . ’
He said : My Lord ! forgive me and my brother , and make us enter unto Thy presence aright , and Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful .
Indeed , those who took the calf &#91; for worship &#93; will obtain anger from their Lord and disgrace in the life of this world .
Thus do We requite those who invent falsehood .
But as for those who do evil , then repent and believe , surely thy Lord thereafter is All-forgiving , All-compassionate .
And when the anger of Moses abated , he took up the tablets , and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord .
And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointment .
Then , when the earthquake seized them , he said , &quot; My Lord , if You had willed , You could have destroyed them before and me &#91; as well &#93; .
Will You destroy us for what the fools among us have done ?
This is but a trial from Thee : by it Thy Grace , Thou leavest astray whom Thou wilt , and guidest whom Thou pleasest .
You are our Protector , so forgive us and have mercy on us , for You are the best of those who forgive .
And ordain for us what is good in this world and in the Hereafter . Indeed , we have turned back to You . &quot;
He said : I smite with My punishment whom I will , and My mercy encompasses all things ; so I shall ordain it for those who fear Me and give the poor-rate and those who believe in Our communications .
Those are they who follow the Messenger , the Prophet of the common folk , in the Torah and the Gospel , wherein they are written down for them , and he bids them to do good things , and forbids them from evil , and makes lawful for them the good things , and makes lawful for them the corrupt things , and relieves them of their burdens and the shackles that were upon them ; so those who believe in him , and follow the light that has been sent down with him , they are the prosperers .
Say : O mankind ! Lo ! I am an apostle unto you all , of Allah , unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth .
There is no god but He : He gives life and causes death .
So believe in Allah and His Messenger , the Unlettered prophet , who believeth in Allah and His words , and follow him that haply ye may be guided .
Yet among the people of Moses there is a nation who guide with the truth and act justly in accordance with it .
And We divided them into twelve tribes , nations . And We inspired Moses , when his people asked him for water , &#91; saying &#93; , &quot; Strike the rock with your staff . &quot;
Then there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs : each tribe knew its drinking-place : and We caused the white cloud to overshadow them , and We sent down upon them manna and quails : eat of the clean things wherewith We have provided you .
And they did not wrong Us , but they used to wrong themselves .
And when it is said to them , &apos; Dwell in this city and eat of wherever you will , and say , &apos; Ask forgiveness , &apos; and enter in at the gate prostrating ; We will forgive you your sins , and shall increase the good-doers . &apos;
But the wrongdoers among them substituted words other than those given to them ; so We sent down upon them a plague from the sky , because of their wrongdoing .
And ask them about the town that was by the sea , when they exceeded the limits of the Sabbath , when their fish came to them openly on their Sabbath day , but on the day when they did not keep the Sabbath they did not come to them .
Thus did We test them because they were transgressors .
And when a community among them said : Why do you admonish a people whom Allah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe chastisement ? They said : To be free from guilt before your Lord , and that haply they may guard ( against evil ) .
So when they forgot what they had been reminded of , We saved those who restrained the evil &#91; ones &#93; , and We seized the wrongdoers with a severe punishment because they used to transgress .
Then , when they rebelled against what they had been forbidden , We said to them , &apos; Be you apes , miserably slinking ! &apos;
And when your Lord proclaimed He would send against them , till the Day of Resurrection , those who would inflict on them a terrible punishment ; and most surely your Lord is quick to requite ( evil ) and most surely He is Forgiving , Merciful .
And We have cut them up into nations in the earth ; some of them are righteous , and some of them are otherwise ; and We tried them with good and evil , that haply they might return .
Then there succeeded after them a posterity who inherited the Book , taking the chance goods of this lower world , and saying , &apos; We shall be forgiven . &apos;
But if similar transitory gains came their way , they would again commit it .
Was not the covenant of the Scripture taken from them that they would not say about Allah except the truth ?
And they have read what is in it .
And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who ward off ( evil ) .
Do you not exercise your reason ?
And those who hold fast to the Book and establish prayer - indeed , We will not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good .
And when We shook the mountain above them as though it were a canopy , and they imagined that it was going to fall on them ; and We said : hold fast to that which We have vouchsafed unto you , and remember that which is therein , that haply ye may fear .
When your Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam , from their loins , their seed , and made them testify concerning themselves , He said , &apos; Am I not your Lord ? &apos;
Lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection , ‘ We were indeed unaware of this . ’
Or lest you say , “ It is our ancestors who associated others with God before — and we were a descendants after them .
Will You destroy us for what the falsifiers have done ? &quot;
Thus do We explain the Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) in detail , so that they may turn ( to the truth ) .
And relate to them the story of him to whom We gave Our signs , but he passed by them ; so Satan followed after him , and he became one of the perverts .
And if We had willed , We could have exalted him thereby , but he clung to the earth and followed his &#91; base &#93; desires .
So his parable is that of a dog : if you chase it , he pants ; but if you leave him , he lolls out his tongue .
Such is the description of the people who reject Our Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) .
So relate the stories , perhaps they may reflect .
Evil is the likeness of the people who reject Our signs as false and perpetrate against themselves .
Whomsoever Allah guides , he is the guided one ; and whomsoever He leads astray , those ! they are the losers .
And certainly We have created for hell many of the jinn and men ; they have hearts with which they do not understand , and they have eyes with which they do not see , and they have ears with which they do not hear ; they are like cattle , nay , they are further astray .
Indeed , they are &#91; themselves &#93; in &#91; a state of &#93; oblivion .
And to Allah belong the Most Beautiful Names , so call on Him by them ; and leave those who blaspheme His names ; they shall soon be requited for what they did .
And of those whom We have created there is a community guiding others with truth and establish justice therewith .
And those who reject Our Ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) , We shall gradually seize them with punishment , in ways they perceive not .
And I will give them respite ; indeed My plan is very solid .
Do they not think that their companion is not possessed ?
He is naught but a plain warner .
Do they not consider the kingdom of the heavens and the earth , and whatever things Allah has created , and that may be their doom shall have drawn near ?
So what discourse will they believe after this ?
For one whom Allah sends astray , there is none to guide him ; and He leaves them to wander blindly in their rebellion .
They ask you about the Hour , “ When will it come ? ”
Say : The knowledge thereof is with my Lord only .
None but He shall reveal its time .
Heavy is it in the heavens and the earth .
It will not come upon you except unexpectedly . &quot;
They ask you as if you had full knowledge of it .
Say : The knowledge thereof is with my Lord , but most of mankind know not .
Say , &quot; I have no control over any benefit or harm to myself except as God wills .
And if I had knowledge of the unseen , I should have amassed all good , and no evil would have touched me .
I am only a warner and a herald of good news to the believing people . &quot;
It is He who created you from a single soul , and from it He created its mate , that he might take comfort in her .
When he had covered her , she bore a light burden and she passed &#91; lightly &#93; with it .
Then if it becomes heavy , they both call upon Allah , their Lord : If Thou givest us a goodly child , we shall surely be of the thankful .
But when He gives them a good &#91; child &#93; , they ascribe to Him partners .
God is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else .
Do they associate with Him those who do not create anything and are themselves the creators ?
And they are not able to give them help , nor can they help themselves .
And if you call them to guidance , they will not follow you .
It is all the same for you whether you call them or you are silent .
Verily those whom ye call upon beside Allah are creatures like unto you .
Call them , and let them answer you , if you are truthful .
Do they have feet to walk with ? Have they hands to hold with ?
Say : Call upon your ( so-called ) partners ( of Allah ) , so plot against me , and keep not waiting .
Lo ! my Protecting Friend is Allah Who revealed the Scripture , and He befriendeth the righteous .
But those whom you call upon besides Him cannot help you , nor can they help themselves . &quot;
And if you call them to guidance , they do not hear .
You will see them looking at you , but they do not see .
So forbear thou the seemly , and turn away from the ignorant .
And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan , then seek refuge in Allah ; surely He is Hearing , Knowing .
Surely those who guard ( against evil ) , when a visitation from the Shaitan afflicts them , they remember ( Allah ) at once they see clearly .
But their brethren ( the evil ones ) plunge them deeper into error , and never relax ( their efforts ) .
When you do not bring them a sign , they say , ‘ Why do you not find it ? ’
Say , &quot; I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord .
These are clear proofs from your Lord , and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe . &apos;
And when the Quran is recited , then listen to it and remain silent , that mercy may be shown to you .
And remember your Lord within your hearts humbly and fearfully , without loudness in words in the morning and evening , and do not be of the heedless .
Indeed , those who are near your Lord are not prevented by arrogance from His worship , and they exalt Him , and to Him they prostrate .
They ask you about the spoils of war .
Say : The spoils are for Allah and the Messenger .
So fear Allah and keep your duty to Allah , and obey Allah and His apostle if ye are believers .
Indeed , those who , when Allah is mentioned , their hearts and strengthened their faith with faith , when His verses are recited to them , and those who put their trust in their Lord .
Those are the ones who establish prayer and spend from what We have provided them .
Such are the true believers .
They have degrees with their Lord , and forgiveness , and a generous provision .
This is just as your Lord brought you out of your home in truth , while a party of the believers were averse &#91; to it &#93; .
Disputing with you concerning the truth after it had become clear , as if they were being driven to death with their eyes wide open .
And ( remember ) when Allah promised you ( Muslims ) one of the two ( enemy ) parties ( of the battle of Badr ) , to which they were under your control , and you wished that the one not armed ( the caravan ) should be yours . But Allah wills to complete the truth by His Words , and to cut off the roots of the disbelievers ( i.e. in the battle of Badr ) .
so that He may bring the truth to the truth and bring the falsehood to naught , and be averse to it . &apos;
When you appealed to your Lord for help , He answered you , and said , ‘ I will aid you with a thousand angels , following one another . ’
Allah did not appoint it but as a good news , and that your hearts might be at rest ; and victory is not but from Allah . Indeed , Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise .
Then He sent down upon you the sleep as a reassurance from Him , and He sent down water from the cloud upon you that He might purify you with it , and take away from you the pollution of Satan , that He might strengthen your hearts , and make your feet firm .
And recall what time thy Lord inspired the angels : verily I am with you ; so steady the believers .
