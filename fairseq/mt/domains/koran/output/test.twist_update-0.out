In the Name of Allah , the Beneficent , the Merciful !
All praise is due to Allah , the Lord of the Worlds
the Merciful , the Merciful
to the Lord on the Day of Judgment !
We serve you ( alone ) and you ( alone ) we ask for help .
Guide us along the straight path
The way of those to whom You have shown mercy , not the way of those who have aroused anger , nor the way of those who go astray .
Alif Lam Mim .
This is the Book ( of Allah ) which gives no cause for doubt , and it is guidance for the righteous .
who believe in the unseen and establish prayer and spend out of what We have given them
And those who believe in what has been revealed to you and before you , and those who count firmly on the Hereafter .
These follow the guidance of their Lord and these are the successful ones .
Lo ! those who disbelieve , it is the same whether you warn them or not ; they do not believe .
Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing , and a veil is over their eyes ; they shall have a great chastisement .
And some people say : We believe in Allah and the Last Day , but they are not believers .
They try to deceive Allah and the believers , and yet they deceive only themselves , and they do not feel this .
In their hearts is sickness , and Allah increases their sickness , and for them is a grievous chastisement because they lie .
And when it is said to them : &quot; Cause no mischief in the earth , &quot; they say : &quot; We are the doers of good . &quot;
Indeed , they are the ones who cause mischief , but they do not feel it .
And when they are told : &quot; Believe as men have believed , &quot; they say : &quot; Shall we believe as fools ? &quot;
Indeed , they themselves are fools , but they do not know .
And when they meet the believers , they say : We believe ; but when they are alone with their Satans , they say : We are with you ; surely we are only mocking .
Allah mocks them and makes them wander blindly .
These are they who have exchanged error for guidance , but their trade has brought them no profit , nor are they guided .
Their example is like the example of him who kindles a fire , and when it had enlightened all around him , Allah made their light disappear and left them in darkness , and they saw nothing .
Deaf , dumb and blind , they did not return .
Or ( their example is ) like a downpour from the sky , full of darkness and thunder and lightning ; they stick their fingers into their ears in fear of the thunder .
And Allah has the disbelievers in His power .
The lightning almost robs them of their sight : whenever it gives them light , they pass through , and when it gets dark around them , they stop .
And if Allah willed , He would certainly have deprived them of hearing and sight ; surely Allah is Exalted in Might over all things .
O mankind ! Serve your Lord , Who created you and those before you that you may guard ( against evil ) .
Who hath made the earth a resting @-@ place for you , and the heaven a structure , and hath sent down water from the heaven , and hath thereby brought forth for you fruits , so Allah equals nothing , when ye know .
And if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to Our servant , bring a Sura like it , and call upon your witnesses besides Allah , if you are truthful .
But if you do not , and you will certainly not , fear the Fire , whose fuel is men and stones ; it is prepared for the unbelievers .
And proclaim the Good News to those who believe and do good , that they may have gardens in the lowlands of which rivers flow ; and whenever they have fruit from them they say : This is what we have eaten before ; but they are given only the like .
And therein belong wives of perfect purity , and they shall abide forever .
Lo ! Allah is not ashamed to make a parable of a gnat or of something higher . Now those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord .
And those who disbelieve say : What then would Allah do with such a parable ?
He thereby leads many astray and guides many righteously , but He thereby leads the wicked astray .
Those who break the covenant of Allah after it has been made , and tear apart that which is to be held together by the commandment of Allah , and cause mischief on the earth ; these are the losers .
How can you deny Allah when you were dead and He gave you life and then caused you to die and then gives you life on the day you return to Him ?
It is He Who created everything on earth for you ; then He turned to the heavens and raised them up to seven heavens ; and He is Acquainted with all things .
And when thy Lord said to the angels : Verily I will appoint a follower on earth , they said : Will Thou appoint therein a mischief @-@ maker and a shedder of blood , when we praise Thy praise and praise Thy glory ?
He said : &quot; Truly I know what you do not know . &quot;
And He taught Adam all the names , then brought them before the angels and said : &quot; Tell me the names of these things , if you are true . &quot;
They said : Glory be to You ! We have no knowledge except that which You have taught us ; surely You are the Knowing , the Wise .
He said : O Adam , give them their names .
And when he gave them their names , He said : Did I not say that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth and that I know what you have revealed and what you have hidden ?
And when We said to the angels : Prostrate yourselves before Adam , they did obeisance to Iblis ; he refused and was arrogant , so he became one of the disbelievers .
And We said : O Adam ! tarry thou and thy spouse in Paradise , and eat of its fruits wherever ye will , but do not come near this tree , lest ye should be of the unjust .
But Satan caused them to stumble there and brought them out of the state in which they were , so We said : Go down ( from Paradise ) .
One of you is the enemy of the other , and you shall have dwellings and sustenance on earth for a limited time . &quot;
So Adam received words from his Lord , and He forgave him ; surely He is the Forgiving , the Merciful .
We said , &quot; Get down from here , everyone ! &quot;
And when My guidance comes to you , those who follow My guidance need not be afraid nor will they grieve .
But those who disbelieve and deny Our communications will be dwellers of the Fire in which they shall abide forever .
O Children of Israel ! Remember My mercy which I have bestowed upon you and fulfil your promise to Me , then I fulfil My promise to you .
And you shall fear Me alone .
Believe in that which I have revealed as a confirmation of what is with you , and be not the first to disbelieve in it ; and do not exchange My communications for a small price , and you shall be reverent to Me alone .
And do not confuse truth with injustice , and do not conceal the truth when you know it .
And establish prayer and pay the zakah and bow down with those who bow down .
Do you want to command people to be upright and forget yourselves when you are reading the book ?
Don &apos;t you have a mind ?
And help yourselves with patience and prayer ; most surely this is difficult except for the humble .
who suspect that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him .
O Children of Israel ! Remember My grace with which I have bestowed upon you and that I have preferred you to all the worlds .
Avoid the day when no soul can vouch for another and no intercession or ransom will be accepted from it , and they will not be helped .
And remember that We saved you from the people of Pharaoh who inflicted on you a grievous punishment by slaughtering your sons and leaving your wives alive ; therein was a grievous trial from your Lord .
And remember that We divided the sea for you and saved you , while We drowned the people of Pharaoh before your eyes .
And remember that We appointed with Moses forty nights when you took the calf behind his back and did wrong with it .
Then We forgave you that you may be grateful .
And remember that We gave Moses the Book and discernment , that you may be guided .
O my people ! you have burdened yourselves with a grievous sin by taking the calf , so return to your Maker in repentance and kill yourselves .
This is better for you with your Maker . &quot; Then He forgave you ; surely He is the Forgiving , the Merciful .
And when you said : O Musa ! We will not believe in you until we see Allah uncovered , the lightning struck you while you were watching .
Then We raised you up again after your death , that you may be grateful
And We cast shadows over you , and We sent down to you manna and quails : Eat of the good things which We have given you , but they did not harm Us , but they did harm themselves .
And We said : Enter this town and eat from wherever you please , and enter by the gate , prostrating yourselves and saying : Forgiveness , that We may forgive you your misdeeds .
And We will give more to the righteous .
But the unjust exchanged the word for that which was not spoken to them , so We sent down upon the unjust a punishment from heaven because they had transgressed .
And when Musa asked for water for his people , We said : Strike the rock with your rod , and twelve springs gushed out of it .
So every tribe knew its place of drinking . &quot; Eat and drink of what Allah has given you , and do no harm in the earth . &quot;
And when you said : O Musa ! We can no longer be satisfied with one food ; so pray to your Lord for us that He may bring forth for us that which grows the earth , herbs , cucumbers , garlic , lentils , and onions . Then he said : Will you exchange that which is less for that which is better ?
Go back to a city . There you will get what you ask for ! &quot;
Shame and misery came upon them , and they succumbed to the wrath of Allah . This was because they repeatedly denied the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly ; this was because they rebelled and transgressed again and again .
Lo ! those who believe , and the Jews , and the Christians , and the Sabaeans , whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good , they have their reward with their Lord , and they shall not be afraid , nor shall they grieve .
And when We made a covenant with you and raised above you the mountain ( and said to you ) : Hold fast to what We have brought you and remember what is contained therein ; perhaps you will guard ( against evil ) .
Then you turned away , and had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy upon you , you would most certainly have been among the losers .
And certainly you knew those of you who broke the Sabbath Law , so We said to them : Be cast out monkeys .
And We made this a warning for all times and a lesson for the righteous .
And when Musa said to his people : Surely Allah commands you to kill a cow , they said : Will you make fun of us ?
He said : &quot; Allah forbid me to be one of the ignorant . &quot;
They said : Pray for us to your Lord that He may explain to us how it shall be .
He said : &quot; Verily He says that she should be a cow which is not too old and not too young , but has an age in between .
So do what you are commanded . &quot;
They said : Call upon thy Lord for us , that He may explain to us what colour it shall be .
He ( Moses ) said : &quot; Verily He says that it is a yellow cow of bright colour , which delights those who see . &quot;
They said : Invoke thy Lord for us , that He may explain to us how it shall be .
For us the cows are like each other , and if Allah wills , we shall surely be guided . &quot;
He ( Moses ) said : &quot; Verily He says that it is a cow that is not dressed , that neither plows the ground nor waters the field , spotless , without stain . &quot;
Then they said : &quot; Now you have come with the truth . &quot; So they slaughtered them , and they almost did not .
And when ye had killed someone and contended among yourselves about it , Allah would bring to light that which ye had concealed .
Then We said : Touch him with a piece of her .
Thus Allah revives the dead and shows you His signs ; perhaps you will understand .
Then your hearts hardened , so that they became like stones , or hardened ; and there are stones out of which streams spring forth , and there are some among them that burst , and out of which flows water .
And there are some of them who fall down out of fear of Allah , and Allah is not heedless of what you do .
Do you desire that they believe in you when a company of them have already heard the Word of Allah and then , after they have understood it , they deliberately falsify it ?
And when they meet those who believe , they say : We believe ; and when they are alone among themselves , they say : Do you speak to them of what Allah has revealed to you , that they may use it against you in the sight of your Lord ?
Don &apos;t you understand ? &apos;
As if they did not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they make known .
There are ignorant among them who do not know the Book , but only wishful thinking ; and they make nothing but conjectures .
But woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say , &quot; This is from Allah , &quot; in exchange for a small price ! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they have earned !
And they say : &quot; Surely the fire will not touch us except for numbered days ! &quot;
Say : Have you received a promise from Allah ?
Then surely Allah will not break His promise , or will you say about Allah that of which you have no knowledge ? &quot;
Whoever has earned iniquity and is imprisoned in his sinfulness , these will be the dwellers of the Fire , in which they will abide forever .
But those who believe and do righteous deeds will be the dwellers of Paradise ; they will abide therein forever .
And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel : &quot; You shall worship no one but Allah , and do good to the parents and kindred , the orphans and the needy , and speak kindly to the people , and establish prayer , and pay the zakah , &quot; then you turned away except a few of yourselves , remaining apostate .
And when We made a covenant with you : &quot; Shed not your blood nor expel each other from your houses , &quot; you promised it and testified .
Yet it is you who kill one another and drive a part of you out of their houses , acting together against them in sin and injustice .
But when they come to you as captives , you redeem them when you have been forbidden to expel them .
Do you believe in one part of the Book and deny another part ?
But for those of you who do this , there is no retribution but disgrace in this life , and on the Day of Resurrection they will be punished with the most severe punishment , and Allah is not heedless of what you do .
These are they who have bought the life of this world for the life of the hereafter ; therefore the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will it be helped for them .
Lo ! We gave Moses the Book , and We made the messengers follow him ; and We gave clear proofs to Jesus son of Mary , and supported him by holy inspiration .
But whenever a messenger brought you something that did not please you , you were arrogant and declared some liars and killed others !
And they said , &quot; Our hearts are insensitive . &quot; But no !
Allah has cursed them because of their disbelief , so they are little believers .
And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming what was before them , and beforehand they had begged ( Him ) for victory over those who disbelieved , but when there came to them that which they already knew , they denied it .
Therefore , the curse of Allah is upon the disbelievers .
Bad is that for which they have sold their souls , denying that which Allah hath revealed , in displeasure that Allah should bring down some of His bounty upon whomsoever of His servants He will .
So they have borne upon themselves wrath upon wrath , and the unbelievers shall have a humiliating chastisement .
When it is said to them : Believe in that which Allah hath revealed , they say : We believe in that which hath been revealed unto us , and they disbelieve in that which hath followed , although it is the truth which confirms that which is in their possession .
Say : So why did you kill the prophets of Allah before , if you were believers ?
And Moses came to you with clear proofs , then you took the calf after it left and did wrong .
And when We made a covenant with you and raised above you the mountain : &quot; Hold fast to what We have given you and listen , &quot; they said : &quot; We hear , but we resist . &quot;
And they were made drunk in their hearts by the calf because of their unbelief .
Say : Bad is that which your Faith commands you , if you are believers .
Say : If the abode of the Hereafter belongs only to you with the exclusion of other people , then desire death for yourselves , if you are truthful .
But they will never desire him because of what their hands have sent before , and Allah knows the unjust .
And most surely you will find them most desirous of all men for life , and more so than those who worship idols .
Some of them would have been granted a life of a thousand years , but he does not shirk the punishment thereby , even if he were granted an old age ; and Allah is Seeing what they do .
Say : &quot; Whoever takes Gabriel as his enemy , he has revealed him ( the Quran ) into your heart by the authority of Allah as a confirmation of what was before him and as guidance and good news for the believers . &quot;
Whoever became an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael , surely Allah is an enemy to the unbelievers .
And We have certainly revealed clear communications to you , and no one denies them but the unjust .
Is it not always the case that every time they enter into an alliance , some of them reject it ? Most of them do not believe it .
And when there came to them a messenger from Allah confirming what they possessed , a party of them to whom the Book was given threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as though they knew nothing .
And they followed what the Satans recited during the reign of Solomon ; but not Solomon disbelieved , but the Satans disbelieved ; they taught magic to men , and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babylon , Harut and Marut . But they taught nothing to anyone except that they said : &quot; We are but a temptation , so do not disbelieve . &quot;
And they learned from them what is used to cause discord between the man and his wife .
But they did no harm to anyone except by the authority of Allah .
And they learned what harms them and does them no good .
And yet they knew that whoever buys it has no share in the Hereafter . Indeed , evil is that for which they sold their souls , if they had known .
But if they had believed and feared Allah , a reward from Allah would have been better , if only they had known .
O you who believe ! do not say : Pay attention to us , but say : Look to us , and listen ( to the Prophet ) . And to the unbelievers will be a painful chastisement .
Those who disbelieve among the owners of the Book and those who worship idols do not wish that any good should be revealed to you from your Lord , but Allah distinguishes with His mercy whom He pleases , and Allah is Abundant in Grace .
When We raise up an ayah or cause it to be forgotten , We bring forth a better one than it or an equivalent one .
Do you not know that Allah has power over all things ?
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth ? And besides Allah you have no guardian or helper .
Or will you inquire of your Messenger as Moses was inquired of before ?
Indeed , whoever exchanges disbelief for faith has strayed from the right path .
Many of those who possess the Scripture , after you have believed , desire to turn you into unbelievers out of envy in their souls after the truth has been made clear to them .
But forgive and be forgiving until Allah permits His decision . Lo ! Allah is Exalted in all things .
And establish prayer and give the zakah , and whatever good you send forth for yourselves you shall find with Allah .
Lo ! Allah seeth well what ye do .
And they say : &quot; No one will enter Paradise except Jews and Christians . &quot; These are wishful thinking .
Say : Bring your proof , if you are truthful .
But whoever submits himself to Allah and does good , his reward is with his Lord , and they will not be afraid nor grieved .
And the Jews say , &quot; The Christians lean on nothing , &quot; and the Christians say , &quot; The Jews lean on nothing , &quot; while they read the Book . Just as they speak , those who have no knowledge speak .
Then Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection of that over which they have contended .
Who is more unjust than he who prevents His name from being invoked in the places of worship of Allah and who is zealous for their destruction ? Those are not allowed to enter them except in fear .
For them there is disgrace in this world and in the Hereafter they shall have a grievous punishment .
And to Allah belongs the East and the West , so wherever you turn , there is the face of Allah . Lo ! Allah is All @-@ Encompassing , All @-@ Knowing .
And they say : Allah hath taken unto Himself a son .
Praise be to Him !
Verily to Him belongs all things in the heavens and the earth , subject to Him .
To the Creator of the heavens and the earth ! When He decides a matter , He says only to it : &quot; Be , &quot; and it is .
And those who have no knowledge say : Why does Allah not speak to us and send us no sign ?
As they speak , so they speak before them : their hearts are alike .
We have made the ayat clear for people with certain beliefs .
We have sent you with the truth as a herald of the Good News and a warner , and you are not responsible for the companions of the Gahim .
Neither the Jews nor the Christians will be satisfied with you until you have followed their confession .
Say : The guidance of Allah is the true guidance . And if you follow their request after knowledge has come to you , you will have neither a guardian nor a helper in the sight of Allah .
Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it should be read ; these believe in it , but those who disbelieve in it are the losers .
O Children of Israel ! Remember My grace which I have bestowed upon you and that I have given you precedence over the nations .
And fear the day when no soul will be able to take anything for another , and no ransom will be taken from it , nor will any intercession avail it , and they will have no help .
And when Abraham was tested by his Lord by words and he accomplished them , He said : I will make you an Imam for mankind .
Then Abraham asked : &quot; Of my seed also . &quot; He said : &quot; My promise is not to those who do wrong . &quot;
And when We made the House a place of contemplation for mankind and a place of safety ( said We ) : Take the place of Abraham as a place of prayer . And We enjoined on Abraham and Ishmael : Purify My House for those who encircle it and those who retreat , those who bow down and prostrate .
And when Abraham said : &quot; My Lord ! make this a safe place and give fruits to those who dwell therein , whoever of them believes in Allah and the Last Day , &quot; He said : &quot; I will provide for him who disbelieves for a short time , then deliver him up to the punishment of the Fire ; and what a bad lot that is ! &quot;
And when Abraham and Ishmael set up the foundations of the house , he said : Our Lord , accept from us ; surely You are the Hearing , the Knowing .
And , our Lord , make us devoted to Thee , and from our descendants a Church devoted to Thee .
And show us how to worship You and turn back to us Your grace ; for You are the Gracious One , the Merciful One .
And , our Lord , raise up among them a messenger from among them who recites to them Thy Words and teaches them the Book and Wisdom and purifies them ; surely Thou art the Mighty , the Wise .
And who despises the faith of Abraham but he who makes himself a fool ?
For We had already chosen him in this world , and in the Hereafter he will surely be of the righteous .
When his Lord said to him : &quot; Submit , &quot; he said : &quot; I submit to the Lord of the Worlds . &quot;
And Abraham enjoined it on his sons , and so did Jacob : &quot; My sons ! Allah has chosen religion for you , therefore die not other than to be submissive . &quot;
Were you witnesses when Jacob was dying , and when he said to his sons , &quot; Whom will you serve when I am gone ? , &quot; they said , &quot; We serve your God , the God of your fathers Abraham , Ishmael , and Isaac , the One God , and to Him are we devoted . &quot;
This is a church of the past ; it will have what it has earned , and you will have what you have earned .
And you will not be responsible for what they have done .
And they say : &quot; If you are Jews or Christians , you will be guided . &quot;
Say : &quot; Yes !
The religion of Abraham , who was a true believer and was not a worshiper of idols . &quot;
We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us , and what has been revealed to Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob and the tribes ( of Israel ) , and what has been given to Moses and Jesus , and what has been given to the prophets from their Lord .
We make no distinction between them and to Him we are devoted .
If they believe as you believe , they will be guided ; but if they turn away , they will only be dissenters ; but Allah will suffice for you against them , and He is the Hearing , the Knowing .
This is the Law of Allah , and who has a Law more beautiful than Allah ?
And to Him we serve .
Say : Will you dispute with us about Allah , where He is our Lord and your Lord ?
But we have our deeds , and you have your deeds , and to Him we are sincere .
Or will you say that Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob and the tribes ( of Israel ) were Jews or Christians ? &quot;
Say : Do you know better or Allah ?
And who is more unjust than he who hides a testimony which he has received from Allah ?
And Allah is not heedless of what you do .
This is a church of the past ; it will have what it has earned , and you will have what you have earned .
And you will not be responsible for what they have done .
The fools among the people will say , &quot; What has caused them to turn away from the qibla they have hitherto followed ? &quot;
Say : To Allah belongs the east and the west ; He guides whom He pleases to a straight path .
And thus We made you a community of the midst , that you may be witnesses of men and that the Messenger may be a witness of you .
And We have not made the qiblah which you have hitherto followed , except that We might distinguish him who follows the Messenger from him who turns back on his heels ; and this was certainly difficult except for those whom Allah has guided .
And it is not Allah Who causes your faith to perish ; surely Allah is Merciful to men , Merciful .
We see your face turning to heaven in search , and We will turn you to a qibla with which you will be satisfied .
So turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque , and wherever you are , turn your faces toward it .
Indeed , those to whom the Book has been given know that it is the truth from their Lord , and Allah is not heedless of what they do .
But if you gave all the proofs to those who were given the Book , they would not follow your qiblah , and you would not follow their qiblah , for they themselves do not follow their respective qiblah among themselves .
But if you should follow their request according to what you have received of knowledge , then surely you would be of those who do wrong .
Those to whom We have given the Book know it as they know their own sons , and yet some of them conceal the truth when they know .
This is the truth from your Lord , so be not of those who doubt .
Everyone has a direction to turn to .
So compete with one another in good deeds . Wherever you are , Allah will bring you all together ; surely Allah has power over all things .
And from whence thou comest , turn thy face toward the Sacred Mosque ; surely this is the truth from thy Lord .
And Allah is not heedless of what you do .
And wherever you come from , turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque . And wherever you are , turn your faces toward it , lest men have any argument against you except those of them who do wrong ; so fear not them but fear Me .
And that I may complete My mercy upon you , and that you may perhaps be guided .
Even as We raised up among you a messenger from among you who recites to you Our verses and purifies you and teaches you the Book and wisdom and teaches you what you did not know .
so remember Me so that I may remember you , and be grateful to Me and do not deny Me .
O you who believe ! seek help in patience and prayer ; surely Allah is with the patient .
And do not call those who were killed in the way of Allah &quot; dead , &quot; for they live , but you do not perceive it .
And certainly We will test you with some fear and hunger and deprivation of wealth and human life and fruits , but proclaim good news to the patient .
Who , when calamity befalls them , say : We belong to Allah and to Him we return .
Upon these do ye Lord pour down blessings and mercy , and they shall be rightly guided .
Verily , As Safa and Al @-@ Marwa are among the places of worship of Allah ; and whoever makes a pilgrimage to the house or performs the Umrah , it is no offence for him to walk between them ; and whoever does good voluntarily , Allah is Knowing , Knowing .
Those who conceal what We revealed of the clear proofs and guidance , after We had explained it to the people in the Book , curse Allah , and they curse those who curse .
Except those who repent , rectify , and clarify . To them I turn again My Grace ; for I am the Gracious @-@ Returning , the Merciful .
Lo ! those who disbelieve and die in their disbelief , upon them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of mankind as a whole .
In that they shall be eternal ; the punishment shall not be lightened for them , nor shall they be given respite .
Your God is One God , there is no God but He , the Merciful , the Merciful .
Verily , in the creation of the heavens and the earth , and in the alternation of the night and the day , and in the ships that sail in the sea with that which profits men , and in that which Allah sent down from the sky of water , and He gave life therewith to the earth after it was dead , and caused to spread over it all kinds of beasts , and in the alternation of the winds and the subservient clouds between the heavens and the earth , are signs for a people who understand .
And there are some of mankind who , besides Allah , take His kind and love as one ought to love Allah .
But those who believe love Allah even more , and when those who do wrong see in the face of the punishment that the power is with Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment .
When those who have been followed ( in this world ) renounce those who have followed them , and they see the chastisement while their bonds are cut off !
And ( if ) those who followed ( them ) say : If we could return , we would renounce them as they renounced us .
Thus Allah shows them their deeds as grievous repentance , and they do not come out of the fire .
O mankind ! eat of what is lawful and good in the earth , and follow not the footsteps of Satan ; surely he is your manifest enemy .
He commands you only evil and abominable things , and that you say about Allah what you do not know .
And when it is said to them : &quot; Follow what Allah has revealed , &quot; they say : &quot; We follow him with whom we found our fathers , &quot; even if their fathers had understood nothing and had not been guided .
The parable of those who disbelieve is like the parable of those who cry out to any ( beast ) that hears nothing but shouting and shouting .
Deaf , dumb and blind , they understand nothing .
O you who believe ! eat of the good things We have prepared for you , and be grateful to Allah if you serve Him alone .
He has forbidden you but ( the consumption of ) natural dead things , blood , pork , and that about which anything other than Allah has been invoked .
But if anyone is compelled to do so without coveting or exceeding what is due , there is no blame on him . Lo ! Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
Those who conceal what Allah has revealed of the Book and sell it for a small price , they consume nothing but fire in their bellies ; and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them , and they shall have a painful chastisement .
They are the ones who have bought error for guidance and the punishment for forgiveness . How can they be steadfast in the face of the Fire !
This is because Allah has revealed the Scripture with truth , and those who dispute about the Scripture are in great enmity .
It is not piety when you turn your faces to the east or the west ; piety is rather that one believes in Allah , the Last Day , the angels , the Book and the Prophets , and of the possession , though one loves it , given to the kinsfolk , the orphans , the needy , the son of the way , the beggars , and slaves , that one may establish prayer and pay the zakah ; it is those who keep their promises when they have made them ; and those who are patient in misery , distress , and in times of war ; it is they who are truthful and pious .
O you who believe , vengeance has been prescribed to you for those who have been killed : the free for the free , the slave for the slave , the female for the female .
But if a person is forgiven something by his brother , the execution is to be done in a dignified manner and the service rendered to him in a charitable manner .
This is a relief from your Lord and a mercy .
Whoever transgresses ( the laws ) from now on will have a grievous chastisement .
In retribution is life for you , O you who are discerning !
Perhaps you will fear Allah .
It is prescribed unto you that , if any of you die , if he leave any property , a bequest shall be made to parents and relatives in a fitting manner .
This is a duty to the righteous .
But whoever changes it after he has heard it , it is only the fault of those who change it . Lo ! Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
But whoever fears injustice or transgression on the part of the testator and makes peace between them , there is no blame on him . Lo ! Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
O you who believe ! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you ; perhaps you will fear ( Allah ) .
They are only days numbered ; and whoever of you is sick or on a journey , let him fast for a number of other days ; and those who are able to bear it with great difficulty shall be made to feed the poor instead .
And if anyone does good voluntarily , it is better for him .
And it is better for you to fast , if only you knew .
The month of Ramadan is the one in which the Quran has been revealed as guidance for mankind and as a clear proof of guidance and discernment . So whoever of you is present in the month , let him fast in it .
And whoever is sick or on a journey , let Allah make it easy for you for a number of other days . He does not want to make it difficult for you so that you may complete the term and glory in Allah that He has guided you . Perhaps you will be grateful .
And when My servants ask you about Me , I am near ; I hear the cry of the calling one when he calls Me .
Therefore let them listen to Me and believe in Me . Perhaps they will take the right path .
You are permitted to approach your wives on the night of fasting ; they are security for you and you are security for them .
Allah knows that you acted deceitfully against yourselves , and He returned to you His favor and forgave you .
So communicate with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you .
And eat and drink until the white thread of the black thread of the dawn appears to you , and then complete the fast until the night .
And do not interact with them while you have withdrawn to the mosques ; these are the limits of Allah , so do not approach them .
Thus does Allah explain His communications to men . Perhaps they will fear ( Him ) .
And do not swallow up your possessions among yourselves unjustly and do not offer them to the authorities in order to swallow up a portion of people &apos;s possessions in a sinful manner when you know .
They ask you about the new moons .
Say : &quot; They are appointed times for the people and the Hagg . &quot;
And there is no piety when you enter houses from the back , but piety is to fear ( Allah ) .
So enter the houses through their doors and fear Allah .
Maybe you will succeed .
And fight those who fight against you by the way of Allah , but do not transgress ; surely Allah does not love those who transgress .
And slay them wherever you meet them , and drive them out of whence they have driven you ; surely the deception is worse than killing .
And fight not against them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight against you there .
But if they fight against you , kill them ; such is the reward of the unbelievers .
But when they cease , Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And fight against them until there is no confusion and the religion belongs to Allah .
But when they cease , there shall be no violence except against those who do wrong .
The holy month is for the holy month , and for the protected things is retribution . So whoever acts violently against you , he acts violently as he did violently against you , and fear Allah , and know that Allah is with the righteous .
And spend in the way of Allah and do not plunge with your own hands into ruin and do good .
Lo ! Allah loveth those who do good .
And complete the Hagg and the Umrah for Allah .
And if you are prevented from doing so , offer a sacrifice which is easy for you , and do not shave your heads until the sacrifice has reached its destination .
And whosoever of you is sick or has a disease on his head , he shall make up for it by fasting , or by charity , or by offering a sacrifice .
And if you feel safe , let him who wants to perform the Umrah with the hagg offer a sacrificial animal that is easy for him .
And whosoever is not able to find any , let him fast three days during the hagg , and seven when ye return , ten in all .
This applies to those whose relatives do not live near the holy mosque .
And guard ( against evil ) and know that Allah is severe in punishment .
For the Hagg are known months ( planned ) Whoever in them has decided to Hagg , let him abstain from sexual intercourse and commit neither iniquity nor unseemly speech during the Hagg .
Whatever good you do , Allah knows it .
And take care of the journey , but the best provision is the fear of God .
And fear Me , O you who are discerning !
There is no wrongdoing on your part if you seek the favor of your Lord .
And when ye hasten from Arafat , then remember Allah at Ai @-@ Masaril @-@ haram , and remember Him how He guided you , when verily ye were among those who strayed before .
Then hurry on from where people are hurrying , and ask forgiveness of Allah .
Lo ! Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And when you have finished your sacred rites , remember Allah as you remember your fathers , or rather with more intense remembrance .
Indeed , among men are those who say : &quot; Our Lord , give us good in this world . &quot; But they do not share in the good in the Hereafter .
And among them are some who say : &quot; Our Lord ! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter , and spare us from the chastisement of the Fire . &quot;
These are given a share of what they have earned , and Allah is swift in reckoning .
And remember Allah for a fixed number of days , and whoever sets out in haste within two days , there shall be no blame on him , and whoever remains longer , there shall be no blame on him if he fears Allah .
And fear Allah and know that you will be led to Him .
And among men there is one whose speech about this world may astonish thee , and he calleth upon Allah for a witness of that which is in his heart , and he is the most contentious of the adversaries .
If he turns away , he endeavors to cause mischief throughout the earth , and destroys the land and the offspring ; and Allah loveth not mischief .
And when he is told , &quot; Fear Allah , &quot; sinful pride overwhelms him . Faith is a fitting reward for him , what a bad resting place !
And among men there is one who gives himself up in the desire of Allah , and most surely Allah is Benevolent to the servants .
O you who believe !
Enter salvation all of you , and follow not the footsteps of Satan ; surely he is your manifest enemy .
And if you should stumble after the proofs have come to you , then know that Allah is Mighty , Wise .
Do they expect that Allah will appear to them shielded from the clouds , and with Him the angels , but then the matter is already decided .
And to Allah are all things returned .
Ask the Children of Israel how many clear proofs We have given them .
But whoever exchanges the favor of Allah after it has been bestowed upon him , then surely Allah is severe in punishment .
The life of this world is attractive to those who disbelieve , and they ridicule those who believe .
But those who guard ( against evil ) shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection , and Allah bestows upon whom He pleases without measure .
Then Allah sent the prophets as bearers of good news and as warners , and He revealed to them the Book with the truth , that He might judge between men concerning that over which they disagreed ; and only those who were given it after clear proofs had come to them disagreed among themselves ; but Allah , by His permission , guides those who believe to the truth over which they disagree ; and Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path .
Or do you think that you will enter Paradise without the like having come upon you as upon those who passed away before you ?
Distress and calamity overtook them , and they were shaken until the Apostle and those who believed with him said : When will the help of Allah come ?
Lo ! the help of Allah is near .
They ask you what to donate .
Say : Whatever good you do , it is for the parents and relatives and the orphans and the needy and the son of the way ; and whatever good you do , surely Allah knows .
You are told to fight , even if you find it disgusting .
But it may be that you loathe something that is good for you , and it may be that you loathe something that is evil for you .
And Allah knoweth , but ye know not .
They ask you about fighting in the holy month .
Say : &quot; The fighting in him is severe .
But turning away from the way of Allah and disbelieving in Him , and forbidding access to the sacred mosque and expelling its inhabitants from it , is more grievous in the sight of Allah , and the seduction is more grievous than killing . &quot;
And they will not cease to fight against you until they turn you away from your faith , if they are able .
But whoso will be turned away from his faith by you , and die an unbeliever , these are they whose deeds shall be worthless in this world and in the Hereafter .
They will be the dwellers of the Fire , and they will abide therein forever .
Lo ! those who believe and emigrate and strive in the way of Allah with all their might , it is they who hope in the Mercy of Allah ; and Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
They ask you about intoxication and gambling .
Say : In both are great evils and benefits for mankind , but their evils are greater than their benefits .
And they ask you what to donate .
Say : &quot; The surplus . &quot;
Thus Allah makes clear to you the communications , that you may reflect .
Say : It is good to improve their situation , and if you associate their affairs with yours , they are your brethren ; and Allah knows how to distinguish the doer of evil from the doer of good ; and if Allah had pleased He would have afflicted you ; surely Allah is Mighty , Wise .
And do not marry idolaters until they believe .
And a believing servant is better than an idolater , no matter how much you like her .
And marry not ( believing women ) with idolaters before they believe .
And a believing servant is better than an idolater , no matter how well you like him .
Those call to the Fire , but Allah calls to Paradise and forgiveness by His permission and makes His communications clear to people that they may remember Him .
And they ask you about menstruation .
Say : It is a suffering .
So keep away from women during menstruation and do not come near them until they are clean , and when they are clean , go to them as Allah has commanded you .
Lo ! Allah loveth those who repent and purify themselves . &quot;
Your wives are a field for you , so cultivate your field as you will , but send ( good ) for you before .
And fear Allah and know that you will meet Him .
And promise the believers the good news .
And do not make Allah a hindrance in your oaths to be honest and righteous and to make peace among men ; and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Allah will not reproach you for carelessness in your oaths , but He will reproach you for what your hearts have earned ; and Allah is Forgiving , Forgiving .
Lo ! those who swear abstinence from their wives shall wait four months , then if they want to give up their oath , Allah is Most Forgiving , Most Merciful .
But if they have made a firm decision to divorce , then surely Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Divorced women are to wait three periods , and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day .
And their husbands have the primary right to take them back if they seek reconciliation .
And the ( women ) have the same rights as they ( the men ) have over them to exercise kindness , but the men are a step above them .
And Allah is Mighty , Wise .
Divorce is twice , then ( the men should keep the women ) appropriately or dismiss them for good .
And it is not lawful for you to take back any of what you have given them , unless both ( men and women ) fear that they will not keep the limits of Allah .
And if ye fear that they will not be able to keep the limits of Allah , then there is no transgression for them both in what they spend to ransom themselves therewith .
These are the limits of Allah , so do not transgress them ; and whoever transgresses the limits of Allah , these are the unjust .
And if he dismisses her , she is no longer allowed to marry him until she has married another man .
If he dismisses them , it is no offence to either of them if they return to one another , provided they believe that they can keep the commandments of Allah . These are the limits of Allah which He makes clear to those who know .
And when ye divorce women , and they approach the fulfillment of their waiting time , then keep them kindly or release them kindly ; but do not keep them out of chicanery to transgress .
And anyone who does this is doing himself wrong .
And do not make fun of the Signs of Allah , and remember the Grace of Allah which He has bestowed on you and what He has revealed to you of the Book and Wisdom to remind you thereby .
And fear Allah and know that Allah is Knower of all things .
And if you discharge the women and they reach their date , do not prevent them from marrying their spouses if they agree kindly .
This is a reminder for those of you who believe in Allah and the Last Day .
That is better for your purity and purity , and Allah knows but you do not know .
And it is incumbent upon the one to whom the child is born to take good care of its food and clothing , and no soul shall be asked to do anything beyond what it can do .
A mother should not be harmed because of her child , and the one to whom the child was born , not because of her child .
And the same is true for the heir ; and if they both , by mutual consent and after consultation , want to wean ( the child prematurely ) , then therein is no offence for them .
And if you wish to breastfeed your children , it is not an offence for you if you pay what you have agreed in a kind manner .
And fear Allah and know that Allah sees well what you do .
And if those of you who are taken away leave wives behind , let them wait four months and ten days ; and when they have reached their term , there is no fault for you if they have good authority over themselves ; and Allah is well acquainted with what you do .
And there is no wrong for you if you indicate to them that you are going to marry or are secretly thinking about it . Allah knew that you will remember them , but do not make an appointment with them secretly unless you say a fitting word , and do not make a firm decision about marriage until the waiting period is fulfilled ; and know that Allah is aware of what is in your souls , so be on your guard against Him , and know that Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing .
It is not a sin for you if you discharge the women before you have touched them or provided them with a bridal gift , but give them provision : the affluent according to what he is able , and the less fortunate according to what he is able , provision in a kind manner .
( This is ) an obligation for the good .
And if you discharge them before you have touched them , but after you have given them a bridal gift , then pay half of what you have given , unless they remit it or he in whose hand the marriage bond is remitting it .
And if ye forgive it , it is nearer to righteousness .
And do not forget to be kind to one another ; surely Allah sees what you do .
Observe prayers , just like the intermediate prayer , and stand humbly before Allah .
But if you are in fear , pray on foot or on horseback , and if you are safe , remember Allah how He taught you that which you did not know .
And those of you who are taken away and leave wives behind , let them bequeath provisions to their wives for a year without them being expelled .
But if they go away , it is not an offence for you if they control themselves for their own good .
And Allah is Exalted , Wise .
And to give to divorced women provision in a kind manner is an obligation for the righteous .
Thus Allah makes His communications clear to you ; perhaps you will understand .
Have you not considered those who went out of their houses in fear of death by the thousands ? Allah said to them : Die .
Then He gave them life . Lo ! Allah is Benevolent to mankind , but most people are not grateful .
And fight in the way of Allah and know that Allah is Hearing and Knowing .
Who is it who gives a good loan to Allah , that He may double it to him many times over ?
And Allah diminishes and multiplies , and to Him you shall be brought back .
Have you not considered the nobles of the children of Israel after Moses , when they said to a prophet among them : &quot; Appoint for us a king that we may fight in the way of Allah . &quot;
He said , &quot; Is it not possible that if you are told to fight , you will not fight ? &quot;
They said : &quot; What shall cause us not to fight in the way of Allah , when we have been driven from our homes and separated from our sons ? &quot;
But when it was commanded them to fight , they turned away but a few of them ; and Allah knows the unjust .
And their Prophet said to them : &quot; Surely Allah has already made Saul king over you . &quot; So they asked : &quot; How can he have dominion over us when we have a right to dominion greater than he and he is not given sufficient possession ? &quot; He said : &quot; Surely Allah has chosen him above you and has bestowed upon him abundant knowledge and bodily advantages ; and Allah gives His dominion to whom He pleases ; and Allah is All @-@ Encompassing , All @-@ Knowing .
And their Prophet said to them : Surely a sign of his dominion shall be that the Ark of the Covenant shall come to you ; therein is peace from your Lord and a legacy of what the descendants of Musa and the descendants of Aaron have left ; it shall be carried by angels .
Verily in that is a sign for you , if you are believers . &quot;
And when Saul went forth with the hosts , he said : Surely Allah will test you by a river .
Whoever drinks from it is not of me , and whoever does not taste of it is of me , except he who draws a handful from it with his hand . &quot;
And they drank of it except a few of them .
And when they had crossed the river , he and those who believed with him , they said : We have no power today against Goliath and his hosts .
How many times has not a small company triumphed over a great company by the permission of Allah !
And Allah is with the patient . &quot;
And when they went to battle against Goliath and his hosts , they said : Our Lord ! give us patience and strengthen our steps and help us against the disbelievers .
And they smote them by the permission of Allah , and David slew Goliath , and Allah gave him dominion and wisdom , and taught him what He pleased .
And if Allah had not withheld some people through others , then indeed the earth would have been filled with evil .
But Allah is Benevolent to all the worlds .
These are the Signs of Allah .
We recite them to you in truth , and most surely you are one of the messengers .
These are the Messengers . We have given some of them precedence over others .
Among them are those to whom Allah has spoken , and some whom He has exalted by degrees .
And We gave clear proofs to Jesus , son of Mary , and supported him by holy inspiration , and if Allah had so willed , those who came after them would not have fought each other after clear proofs came to them , but they disagreed .
Some of them believed , others disbelieved .
If Allah had so willed , they would not have fought each other .
But Allah does what He pleases .
O you who believe ! Spend of what We have given you before a day comes when there will be no action , no friendship and no intercession ; it is the unbelievers who do wrong .
Allah has no god but He , the Living , the Eternal .
Neither slumber nor sleep seizes him .
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . Who is he who can intercede with Him except by His permission ?
He knows what is before them and what is behind them , but they do not understand anything of His knowledge except what He wills .
His Throne extends far over the heavens and the earth , and it is not difficult for Him to guard them ; and He is the High , the Exalted .
There is no coercion in faith .
The right path has now become clear in the face of the wrong one .
Indeed , whoever does not believe in false gods but believes in Allah has seized the firmest support with which there is no tearing apart ; and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Allah is the Protector of those who believe . He brings them out of the darkness into the light . But those who disbelieve - their friends are the idols . They lead them out of the light into the darkness . They will be the dwellers of the Fire , therein they will abide forever .
Have you not considered him who contended with Abraham about his Lord , because Allah had given him dominion ?
When Abraham said : &quot; My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die , &quot; he said : &quot; I am He who gives life and causes to die . &quot;
Then Abraham said : But it is Allah Who causes the sun to rise in the east , so you cause it to rise in the west . So the disbeliever was confused .
And Allah guides not the unjust people .
Or ( have you not thought about ) him who passed by a city that lay desolate in ruins ?
Then he said : &quot; Oh , how shall Allah give it life again after its destruction ? &quot;
And Allah caused him to be dead for a hundred years , then raised him up again .
He said , &quot; How long have you stayed ? &quot;
He said : &quot; I remained for a day or part of a day . &quot; So He said : &quot; But you remained for a hundred years .
Now consider your food and your drink . They are not corrupted .
And look at your donkey . We make you a sign to the people .
And consider the bones as We assemble them and clothe them with flesh . And when this was made clear to him , he said : I know that Allah has power over all things .
And remember when Abraham said : &quot; My Lord , let me see Thou bring the dead back to life , &quot; He said : &quot; Do you not then believe ? &quot;
He said : &apos; Yes !
But ( I ask ) to calm my heart . &quot;
He said : &quot; Take four birds and cut them up , then put some pieces on each mountain . Then call them .
They will come to you in haste , and know that Allah is Mighty and Wise . &quot;
The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like the parable of a grain growing seven ears , in each ear a hundred grains .
And Allah multiplies it to whom He pleases ; and Allah is All @-@ Encompassing , All @-@ Knowing .
Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah , then do not follow up what they have spent with reproach or impropriety , they will have their reward from their Lord , and there will be no fear on them nor will they grieve .
Good speech and forgiveness are better than a charity which is followed by evil ; and Allah is Abundant and Gentle .
O you who have believed , do not prevent your charity by reproach and affliction , like him who spends his wealth to be seen by men , and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day .
The likeness of this is the likeness of a rock with dust on it , and an overflowing rain falls on it , leaving it hard .
They do not avail themselves of their merit ; surely Allah guides not the disbelievers .
And the parable of those who spend their wealth seeking the pleasure of Allah and strengthening their souls is the parable of a garden on a hill : a shower touches it , and it brings forth its fruit twice ; and if no rain touches it , yet there is dew .
And Allah sees through what you do .
Does any of you desire that he should possess a garden of palm trees and vines , beneath which rivers flow , in which he may have all kinds of fruits , and that old age may overtake him while he still has weak offspring , and that a fiery whirlwind may strike him and he may burn up ?
This is how Allah explains the signs to you . Perhaps you are thinking about them .
O you who believe ! spend of the good that you have earned and of that which We bring forth for you from the earth , and do not choose from among it as a gift the evil that you yourselves do not take without turning your eyes ; and know that Allah is the Kingdom and the Glory .
Satan threatens you with poverty and commands you to commit indecency , but Allah promises you His forgiveness and bounty ; and Allah is All @-@ Encompassing and All @-@ Knowing .
He gives wisdom to whom He pleases , and to whom wisdom has been given is given great wealth ; but those who are reminded are those who have understanding .
And whatever you give or promise as vows , lo ! Allah knoweth , and the unjust find no helpers .
If ye manifest alms , it is acceptable ; and if ye conceal them and give them to the poor , it is better for you and atone for your iniquities ; and Allah is Acquainted with what ye do .
Their guidance is not yours , but Allah guides whom He wills .
Whatever good you spend is for yourselves , and you shall not spend except out of desire for the presence of Allah . And whatever good you spend , it shall be fully refunded to you , and you shall not be wronged .
( This is ) for the poor who are prevented from moving freely in the land by the way of Allah ; the ignorant consider them rich because of their restraint .
But you recognize them by their appearance . They do not beg people intrusively .
And whatever good you give , surely Allah knows .
Those who spend their wealth by night and by day , secretly or openly , to them is their reward from their Lord , and they need not be afraid nor will they grieve .
Let those who devour interest be no other than one seized by Satan and driven to madness .
This ( is supposed to be so ) because they say , &quot; Trade is the same as taking interest . &quot;
But Allah has permitted commerce and forbidden interest .
And if a reminder comes to a man from his Lord , and he ceases that which has already been done , that shall remain ; and his cause is with Allah .
But whoever does it anew will be dwellers of the Fire , therein they will abide SO forever .
Allah will make usury disappear and increase charity , and Allah does not love anyone who is a stubborn disbeliever and a wrongdoer .
Lo ! those who believe and do righteous deeds and establish prayer and pay the Zakah , their reward is from their Lord , and they have no need of fear nor will they grieve .
O you who believe ! Fear Allah and renounce what is left of interest if you are believers .
And if you do not do this , then war is declared to you by Allah and His Messenger .
But if you repent , then your capital shall be due to you , so that you shall not be wronged nor wronged .
If anyone is in difficulty , then give him respite until there is relief . But if you do charity , it is better for you if you only knew .
And fear the day when you will be brought back to Allah .
Then every soul will be repaid what it has earned , and they will not be wronged .
O you who believe , when you grant a loan or take it out for an appointed term , then write it down , and let a scribe write it down faithfully in your presence .
And let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught , so let him write , and let the debtor dictate , and fear Allah his Lord , and leave nothing out of it .
And if the debtor is weak @-@ minded or weak , or unable to dictate for himself , let his guardian faithfully dictate for him .
And cause two witnesses among your men to bear witness , and if there are no two men , then a man and two women of those who seem fit for you as witnesses , so that if one of them erred , the other of them would remind them .
And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called , and do not disdain to write it down , large or small , until the appointed time .
That is more righteous in the sight of Allah , and more reliable in the witness , and saves you from doubt , unless it is a commodity immediately available to you , which goes from hand to hand among you ; then it is not an offence for you if you do not write it down .
And take witnesses if you trade with one another , and no harm shall be done to the scribe or to the witness .
And if ye do it , then verily it is an iniquity on your part .
And fear Allah , and Allah teaches you , and Allah is Aware of all things .
And if ye are on a journey and find no scribe , then let a pledge be received ; and if any of you entrusts to another , let him to whom it is entrusted restore that which is entrusted to him and fear Allah , his Lord , and do not suppress the testimony ; and whoever conceals it , his heart is indeed tainted with guilt ; and Allah is well @-@ acquainted with what ye do .
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth ; and whether you make known what is in your souls or conceal it , Allah will hold you accountable for it ; then forgive whom He pleases and punish whom He pleases ; and Allah has power over all things .
The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord , and so do the believers ; they all believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers . We make no distinction between His messengers .
And they say : We hear and obey ; grant us Your forgiveness , our Lord , and to You is the return .
Allah does not require of any soul anything beyond what it can accomplish .
She shall have what she has earned , and upon her shall come that which she has made herself to owe . O our Lord ! do not reproach us if we forget or make mistakes .
Our Lord , and do not impose upon us a burden like that which You have imposed on those who were before us .
Our Lord , and charge us with nothing for which we have no strength .
And forgive us and forgive us and have mercy on us .
You are our protector . So help us against the people of the unbelievers . &quot;
Alif Lam Mim .
Allah has no god but He , the Living , the Permanent .
He has revealed to you the Book with the truth confirming what was before it , and He has revealed the Torah and the Gospel .
as guidance for mankind before , and He has revealed ( the Book ) for discernment .
Lo ! those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah will have a severe chastisement , and Allah is Mighty and Lord of Retribution .
Surely from Allah nothing is hidden , neither in the earth nor in the heaven .
It is He Who shapes you in the womb as He wills .
There is no god but He , the Mighty , the Wise .
He it is Who has revealed to thee the Scripture ; in it are clear verses , the foundation of the Scripture , and others of different interpretations ; but those in whose hearts is ( inclination ) to turn away follow what is to be interpreted therein , that they may cause dissension and seek interpretation , seeking their perverse interpretation ; but no one knows their interpretation except Allah ; but those who have profound knowledge say : We believe in it ; everything is from our Lord ; and no one remembers it except the wise .
Our Lord ! let not our hearts turn away ( from You ) after You have guided us .
And grant us mercy from Thee , for Thou art indeed the unceasing Giver .
Our Lord ! Thou wilt bring people together on a Day of which there is no doubt . Lo ! Allah never misses His appointment .
Lo ! those who disbelieve , neither their wealth nor their children shall avail themselves with Allah .
It is they who become the fuel of the fire .
s people and those before them , they rejected Our communications as a lie , so Allah seized them in their guilt , and Allah is severe in punishment .
Say to those who disbelieve : Soon you will be defeated and gathered together in Gahannam what a bad resting place !
A sign had been bestowed upon you in the two bands which met : one band fought in the way of Allah and the other disbelieved ; they saw with their own eyes ( their adversaries ) twice as many , and Allah strengthens with His help whom He pleases .
Lo ! therein is a lesson for those who have understanding .
For the enjoyment of men is the enjoyment of their desire for women and children , and accumulated quantities of gold and silver and horses and cattle and fields . This is the enjoyment of earthly life , but with Allah is the most beautiful return .
Say : Shall I tell you better than this ?
For those who guard ( against evil ) there are with their Lord Gardens beneath which rivers flow , in which they will abide forever , and pure wives and the pleasure of Allah .
And Allah sees through the servants
Saying : Our Lord ! surely we believe ; therefore forgive us our sins and preserve us from the chastisement of the Fire .
The patient and the truthful and the devout and the dispensers and those who ask forgiveness at dawn .
Allah has testified that there is no god but He Himself ; and the angels and the knowledgeable ( bear witness ) ; He cares for justice .
There is no god but He , the Mighty , the Wise .
Indeed , the religion of Allah is Islam , and those to whom the Scripture was given did not disagree until knowledge came to them out of displeasure .
And whoever disbelieves in the communications of Allah , surely Allah is swift in reckoning .
And when they dispute with thee , say : I have submitted myself wholly to Allah , and likewise he who follows me .
And say to those to whom the Scripture was given and to the unlearned : Do you become Muslims ?
And when they become Muslims , they are guided ; but if they turn away , it is only for you to preach .
And Allah sees through the servants .
Lo ! those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah , and kill the prophets without cause , and slay those who admonish righteousness , to them proclaim a grievous chastisement .
They are the ones whose deeds are futile in this world and in the Hereafter , and they have no helpers .
Did you not look at those to whom a portion of the Book was given when they were summoned to the Book of Allah to judge between them ?
Then a party of them turned their backs and turned away ,
by saying , &quot; The fire will never touch us , except for numbered days . &quot;
And it deceived them in their faith what they themselves devised .
But what if We gather them together on a Day over which there is no doubt , and every soul shall be recompensed for what it has earned , and they shall not be wronged ?
O Allah , Lord of the kingdom ! Thou givest the kingdom to whom Thou wilt and taketh the kingdom to whom Thou wilt , and Thou honourest whom Thou wilt , and Thou humblest whom Thou wilt .
In Thy hand is good ; verily Thou hast power over all things .
You cause the night to pass into the day , and cause the day to pass into the night ; and You raise the living from the dead , and raise the dead from the living , and provide for whom You will without measure . &quot;
The believers should not take the disbelievers as guardians instead of the believers , and whoever does this will not find help from Allah except you are afraid of them .
And Allah warns you of Himself , and to Allah is the return .
Say : Whether you hide what is in your bosom or whether you make it known , Allah knows ; He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth ; and Allah has power over all things .
On that day every soul will find ready what good it has done ; and what evil it has done it will desire that there should be a long period of time between it and it .
And Allah warns you of Himself , and Allah is Kind to His servants .
Say : &quot; If you love Allah , follow me ; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins ; for Allah is Forgiving , Merciful . &quot;
Say : Obey Allah and the Messenger ; and when they turn their backs , lo ! Allah loveth not the disbelievers .
Surely Allah chose Adam and Noah and the house of Abraham and the house of Imran above all the worlds .
a generation one from another , and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
At that time , the wife of Muhammad said , &quot; My Lord , behold , I vow to You to consecrate to You what is in my womb ; so accept it of me ; behold , You are the Hearer , the Knower . &quot;
And when she gave birth to it , she said : My Lord ! surely I gave birth to it as a maiden , and Allah knew what she gave birth to ; surely the boy is not like the maiden .
&quot; And I have called her Mary , and behold , I would that she and her seed should take refuge in You from Satan who is stoned . &quot;
And so Allah accepted them graciously and made them grow up beautifully in the care of Zacharias .
Whenever Zacharias came to her in the temple , he found food with her , so he said : O Mary ! whence is this to thee ?
She said : &quot; It is from Allah ; surely Allah provides for whom He wills indefinitely . &quot;
Then Zacharias called upon his Lord and said : My Lord ! Give me good offspring as a gift from Thee ; surely Thou art the Hearer of prayer .
And the angels called to him as he stood in prayer in the temple : &quot; Lo ! Allah hath promised thee John , the confirmer of a word from Allah , a nobleman , an ascetic and a prophet , one of the righteous . &quot;
He said : &quot; My Lord , shall a male be given to me when old age has overtaken me and my wife is barren ? &quot;
He said : Allah does what He pleases .
He said : &quot; My Lord , give me a sign . &quot;
He said : Your sign is that for three days you will not speak to people except by gestures , and remember your Lord often and glorify Him in the evening and in the morning .
O Mary ! surely Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds .
O Mary ! be full of devotion before your Lord and prostrate and bow down with those who bow down . &quot;
This is one of the revelations of the unseen which We reveal to you , for you were not with them when they cast their tubes as to which of them should take care of Mary , and you were not with them when they contended .
O Mary ! Allah announces to you a word from Him . His name is the Messiah , Jesus , the son of Mary , honoured in this world and the Hereafter , and one of those who are near ( to Allah ) .
And he will speak to men in the cradle and also as an adult , and he will be one of the righteous . &quot;
She said : &quot; My Lord , shall a son be born to me when no man has touched me ? &quot;
He said : Allah creates what He pleases ; when He has decreed anything , He says only to him : Be , and it is .
And He will teach him the Book and Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel .
And he will send him to the children of Israel . ( He will say : ) Behold ! I have come to you with a sign from your Lord .
Behold , I create for you from clay the form of a bird and breathe into it , and it shall become a bird by permission of Allah , and I heal the blind @-@ born and the leper , and I give life to the dead by permission of Allah , and I declare to you what you eat and what you store in your houses .
Verily in that is a sign for you , if you believe .
And as a confirmer of the Torah which was before me , and to permit you a portion of that which was forbidden to you , I have come to you with a sign from your Lord . So fear Allah and obey me .
Lo ! Allah is my Lord and your Lord , therefore serve Him ; this is a straight path . &quot;
And when Jesus perceived their disbelief , he said : Who is my helper to Allah ?
We are helpers of Allah ; we believe in Allah and bear witness that we are submissive to Him .
Our Lord ! We believe in what You have revealed and follow the Messenger .
Therefore list us among the witnesses . &quot;
And they devised a deceit , and Allah devised a deceit , and Allah is the best of the blacksmiths .
O Jesus ! I will cause you to pass away and exalt you to Me , and I will deliver you from the unbelievers , and I will set your followers above the unbelievers until the Day of Resurrection .
Then you will return to Me , and I will judge between you over that over which you differed .
But as for the unbelievers , I will punish them severely in this world and the Hereafter , and they will not find any helpers . &quot;
But as for those who believe and do good , He will give them their full reward , and Allah does not love the unjust .
This We recite to you of the Signs and the Wise Reminder .
Lo ! Jesus is like Adam in the sight of Allah ; He created him from dust , when He said to him : Be , and there he was .
That is the truth from your Lord , so be not of the doubters .
And if anyone contends with you about them after the knowledge has come to you , say : Come , let us call our sons and your sons , our wives and your wives and our souls and your souls , then let us invoke Allah and punish the liars with the curse of Allah .
Lo ! this is the story of truth , and there is no god but Allah , and Allah is the Exalted in Might , the Wise .
And when they turn back , Allah knows the wrongdoers .
Say : O People of the Book ! Come to the same word between us and you , that we may worship Allah alone and put nothing beside Him , and that none of us may take the others but Allah as masters .
And when they turn away , say : Witness that we are devoted ( to Him ) .
O People of the Scripture ! why do you dispute about Abraham when the Torah and the Gospel were revealed after him ? Have you no understanding ?
You have quarrelled over that of which you have knowledge ; but why do you quarrel over that of which you have no knowledge ?
Allah knoweth , but ye know not .
Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian , but he was a true believer , a Muslim , and not one of those who associate ( Allah ) with companions .
Indeed , the people closest to Abraham are those who follow him , and this Prophet ( Muhammad ) and the believers ; and Allah is the Protector of the believers .
A party of the People of the Scripture would like to deceive you , but they deceive only themselves and do not know .
O People of the Book , why do you disbelieve in the communications of Allah when you bear witness to them ?
Ye People of the Scriptures , why do ye mix truth with falsehood , and hide the truth from your knowledge ?
Believe in what has been revealed to the believers at daybreak , and deny it at its end ; perhaps they will repent .
And believe only those who follow your religion . &quot;
Say : Surely the guidance is the guidance of Allah .
That what has been given to you may be given to ( another ) or if they dispute with you before your Lord , say : Lo ! the bounty is in the hand of Allah ; He grants it to whom He pleases .
And Allah is All @-@ Encompassing and All @-@ Knowing .
He distinguishes with His mercy whom He pleases , and Allah is full of great bounty . &quot;
And among the People of the Book there are those who , if you entrust them with a large sum , they will give it to you , and among them there are those who , if you entrust them with a dinar , they will not give it to you unless you are always after them .
This is because they say : We have no duty against the unlearned ; and they speak a lie against Allah and know it .
But whoever does his duty and fears Allah , lo ! Allah loves the righteous .
Lo ! those who sell their covenant with Allah and their oaths for a small price have no share in the Hereafter , and Allah will not speak to them , nor will He look upon them on the Day of Resurrection , nor will He purify them , and they shall have a grievous chastisement .
Lo ! a party of them twist their tongue with the Scripture , that ye may consider it a party of the Scripture , though it is not in the Scripture ; and they say , It is from Allah ; but it is not from Allah , and they speak a lie against Allah , though they know it .
It is not permissible that a man to whom Allah has given the Book and Wisdom and Prophethood should say to the people : &quot; Be my servants with Allah . &quot; Rather , he should say : &quot; Be doctors of God with what you have taught and with what you have studied . &quot;
And He does not command you to take for yourselves the angels or the prophets .
Shall He command you to disbelieve after you have surrendered to Him ?
And then Allah accepted the covenant from the Prophets : &quot; If I give you the Book and Wisdom , then there will come to you a messenger confirming what you have ; surely you shall believe him and help him . &quot;
He said : &quot; Do you accept this and do you accept the covenant with Me on this condition ? &quot;
They said : We acknowledge it . He said : So bear witness to it , and I will be with you among the witnesses .
Those who turn away after this are the wicked .
Do they desire a religion other than the religion of Allah ?
To Him surrenders whatever is in the heavens and the earth , obedient or unwilling , and to Him they return .
Say : We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us , and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes , and what has been given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord ; we make no distinction between them , and to Him are we submissive .
And whoever desires a religion other than Islam , it will never be accepted from him , and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers .
How can Allah guide a people who disbelieve after their faith and after they have testified that the Messenger is true , and after the clear communications have come to them ?
And Allah guides not the unjust .
Their reward is that upon them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of mankind as a whole .
They will abide therein forever ; the punishment will not be lightened for them and they will not be given respite
Except those who repent thereafter and do righteous deeds . Lo ! Allah is Forgiving and Merciful .
Behold , whoever disbelieves after his faith and falls more and more into disbelief , his repentance will not be accepted , and these are the erring ones .
Indeed , those who disbelieve and die in disbelief will never be accepted from them an earth full of gold , even if they wanted to redeem themselves with it .
These will have a painful punishment , and they will have no helpers .
Ye shall not attain kindness until ye spend of that which ye love ; and whatsoever ye spend , lo ! Allah knoweth .
All food was lawful for the children of Israel , except that which Israel forbade itself before the Torah was revealed .
Say : So bring the Torah and read it , if you are truthful .
And those who afterwards forge a lie against Allah are the unjust .
Say : Allah speaks the truth .
So follow the religion of Abraham , the pure in faith , who set no gods beside Allah . &quot;
Verily , the first house established for mankind is in Bakka a blessed one and a guidance for the worlds .
In him are clear signs the place of Abraham .
And who enters it is safe .
And the duty of men to Allah is the pilgrimage to the house , whoever can make the way to it .
But whoever disbelieves , Allah is not dependent on the worlds .
Say : O People of the Book ! why do you disbelieve in the communications of Allah when Allah is witness of what you do ?
Say : O People of the Scripture ! have you turned the believers away from the way of Allah ? Ye seek to make it crooked when ye bear witness to it .
But Allah is not heedless of what you do . &quot;
O you who believe ! if you obey a party of those who have been given the Scripture , they will disbelieve after your faith .
But how will you disbelieve when the verses of Allah are recited to you and His Messenger dwells among you ?
And whoever holds fast to Allah is guided to the right path .
O you who believe ! Fear Allah with due fear , and die not other than as Muslims .
Hold fast to the cords of Allah , and do not disintegrate , and remember the mercy of Allah upon you when you were enemies , and He so closed your hearts that by His mercy you became brethren , and when you were on the edge of a pit of fire and He delivered you from it .
Thus does Allah make clear to you His communications , that you may be guided .
And there shall be of you a community inviting to good and commanding what is right and forbidding what is wrong ; and these are the successful .
And do not be like those who are divided and divided after the clear signs have come to them ; and those await a painful chastisement .
On a Day when faces shall become white and faces shall become black ; and as for those whose faces shall become black : Have you disbelieved after your faith ? So the penalty shall be because you disbelieved .
And as for those whose faces shall become white , they shall be by the grace of Allah , and therein they shall abide forever .
These are the Signs of Allah ; We relate them to you in truth , and Allah wills no injustice against the worlds .
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth , and to Allah all things return .
You are the best community ever created for mankind ; you command what is right , and you forbid what is wrong , and you believe in Allah .
And if the People of the Scripture had believed , surely it would have been good for them ! Among them are believers , but the majority of them are unjust .
They will never cause you harm except a small harm , and if they fight against you , they will turn their backs on you , as though they will not be victorious .
Humiliation is prescribed for them wherever they are hit , unless they are safe ( because of ) their bond with Allah or with mankind .
And they incur the wrath of Allah , and poverty is prescribed for them , because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and murdered the prophets unjustly , because they were rebellious and transgressors .
But they are not ( all ) the same .
Among the People of the Scripture there is a community who always recite the verses of Allah at the time of the night and prostrate thereby .
They believe in Allah and the Last Day and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and compete in good deeds ; and these are of the righteous .
Whatever good they do is never denied them , and Allah knows those who guard ( against evil ) .
Lo ! those who disbelieve , their wealth and their children will not avail themselves of anything in the sight of Allah ; and those are the companions of the Fire , and they shall abide therein forever .
The parable of what they spend in this earthly life is the parable of the freezing wind that strikes the field of men who sin against themselves .
So he destroyed him , and it was not Allah who was unjust to them , but they were unjust to themselves .
O you who believe ! Make no friendship except with your fellows .
They will not hesitate to destroy you , and desire your doom .
Hatred has already come out of her mouth , but that which hides within her is worse .
Already We have made clear to you the Signs , when you understand .
Look !
It is ye who love them , but they love you not ; and ye believe in the whole book .
And when they meet you , they say : We believe ; but when they are alone , they bite at your fingertips in wrath .
Say : &quot; Die of your wrath . &quot;
Lo ! Allah knoweth the depths of your hearts .
When good touches you , they feel it to be evil , and when evil touches you , they rejoice in it ; but if you are patient and righteous , their cunning will not harm you . Behold , Allah comprehends ( with His knowledge ) what they do .
And at that time you left your family early in the morning to instruct the believers in the positions of battle ; and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
So two groups of you almost lost heart , and Allah was Protector of both , and on Allah let the believers rely .
And then Allah made you victorious at Badr , while you appeared disdainful ; therefore fear Allah ; perhaps you will be grateful .
Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels sent down ?
Indeed , if you are patient and righteous , and they come upon you at once , your Lord will help you in battle with five thousand angels . &quot;
And this alone did Allah make for you glad tidings , and that your hearts may rest , for the victory is only from Allah , the Mighty , the Wise .
That He may cut off a portion of the unbelievers or subdue them , so that they may return disappointed .
It does not depend on you whether He turns to them again forgiving or whether He punishes them , for they are indeed wrongdoers .
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth ; He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases , and Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
O you who believe ! do not swallow up interest duplicates , but fear Allah ; perhaps you will be successful .
And fear the fire prepared for the disbelievers ,
and obey Allah and the Messenger ; perhaps you will find mercy .
And strive for the forgiveness of your Lord and for a garden the breadth of which is equal to that of heaven and earth , prepared for the righteous .
who spend in joy and sorrow and suppress resentment and forgive mankind , and Allah loves the righteous .
And those who , if they have done something indecent or have sinned against themselves , remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins ; and who forgives the sins but Allah ? and those who do not persist in what they did knowingly .
For them their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow ; therein they will be forever , and glorious is the reward of those who work .
There have been ways of life before you . So walk through the earth and see what was the end of those who have denied ( the truth ) .
This is an announcement to mankind and a guidance and an admonition for the righteous .
And be not discouraged and sorrowful ; you will be victorious if you believe .
If hardship has hit you , hardship has already hit other people .
And We make these days alternate among men , that Allah may know the believers and choose witnesses out of you , and Allah loveth not the unjust .
And that Allah may purify the believers and destroy the unbelievers .
Or do you think that you enter Paradise without Allah knowing those who have fought among you , and He does not know those who are patient ?
And you wished for death before you met it , and now you saw it with your own eyes .
And Muhammad is but a messenger ; before him went the messengers .
And whether he dies or is killed , will you turn back on your heels ?
And whoever turns back on his heels , he does no harm to Allah , but Allah will most surely reward those who give thanks .
No one shall die without the permission of Allah ; ( for this is ) according to a preordained time .
And to him who desires the reward of the world , We give thereof , and to him who desires the reward of the Hereafter , We give thereof ; surely We will reward the grateful .
And how many prophets fought against ( an enemy ) followed by many righteous , but they were not discouraged by what befell them in the way of Allah , nor did they weaken nor humble themselves ; and Allah loves the patient .
And their word was no other than that they said : Our Lord ! forgive us our sins and our trespasses in our cause , and establish our steps and help us against the unbelieving people .
And Allah gave them the reward of this world and the most beautiful reward of the Hereafter . And Allah loves those who do good .
O you who believe , if you obey the disbelievers , they will turn back on your heels and you will be the losers .
But Allah is your Protector , and He is the best Helper .
We will cast terror into the hearts of the disbelievers , because they associate with Allah gods for which He has not sent down any authority ; and their abode will be the fire , and evil is the lodging of the unjust .
Lo ! Allah had already kept His promise to you when ye destroyed them by His leave , till ye were dismayed , and contended about the matter , and disobeyed after He had shown you what ye desired .
Some of you longed for this world and others longed for the Hereafter .
Then He turned you away from them in order to test you , and surely He has now forgiven you .
For Allah is full of bounty to the believers .
When you ascended and paid no attention to anyone while the Messenger was calling after you , He rewarded you with sorrow after sorrow , that you should not grieve for what you have lost and for what you have suffered ; and Allah knows what you do .
Then He sent down upon you after the sorrow security ( in the manner of ) drowsiness ; weariness overtook one party of you , and another party was concerned with itself ; they think unjustly of Allah in the pagan mind .
They said , &apos; Do we have any of that ? &apos;
Say : Behold ! the whole thing is for Allah .
They hid in their souls what they did not tell you , saying , &quot; If we had had any of this , we would not have been slain here ! &quot;
Say : If ye had been in your houses , most surely those would have gone forth who were forewarned of death in their resting @-@ places and that Allah might try what was in you and search out what was in your hearts ; and Allah knows the depths ( of men ) .
Lo ! those of you who turned their backs on the day of the clash of the two hosts ( Allah ) only Satan led them astray for some of their deeds .
But surely Allah has now forgiven them ; surely Allah is Forgiving and Merciful .
O you who believe ! Be not like the unbelievers who say of their brethren when they passed through the land or were contenders : Had they remained with us , they would not have died or been slain .
Allah appointed this as sorrow for their hearts .
And Allah gives life and causes death , and Allah sees through what you do .
And verily if ye are slain in the way of Allah or die , verily the forgiveness and mercy of Allah is better than what ye gather together .
And if you die or are slain , you will be gathered before Allah .
And you were kind to them in view of the mercy of Allah , but if you had been harsh and hard @-@ hearted , they would have run away from you .
Therefore forgive them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter ; and if you are determined , trust in Allah ; for Allah loves those who trust in Him .
Indeed , if Allah gives you victory , there is no one who can prevail over you ; but if He abandons you , who can help you but Him ?
Lo ! in Allah shall the believers trust .
And no prophet shall embezzle ( any of the booty ) , and whoever embezzles shall bring what he has embezzled on the Day of Resurrection ; then every soul shall be recompensed according to its merit , and no injustice shall be done to them .
And is he who desired the good pleasure of Allah like he who incurred the wrath of Allah and whose lodging is Hell ? And evil is the end .
They are of varying rank with Allah , and Allah sees through what they do .
Lo ! Allah was gracious to the believers when He raised up among them a messenger from among them to recite to them His verses and to purify them and to teach the Book and Wisdom ; surely they had been in manifest error before .
And when calamity befell you , after you had doubled it , did you say , &quot; Whence comes this ? &quot;
Say : It comes from yourselves .
Lo ! Allah has power over all things .
And what happened to you on the day of the clash between the two bands was by the permission of Allah , and that He might know the believers .
And He recognizes the hypocrites to whom it was said : Come , fight in the way of Allah or fend off . But they said : If we had known how to fight , surely we would have followed you . On that day they were nearer to disbelief than to faith ; they said with their mouths that which was not in their hearts ; and Allah knows what they conceal .
Those who said to their brethren while they were at home : If they had obeyed us , they would not have been slain . Say : So avert death from you , if you are truthful .
And do not consider as dead those who have fallen into the way of Allah , but they live with their Lord , and there they are provided for .
They rejoice in what Allah has given them of His bounty , and they rejoice in those who have not followed them , so there shall be no fear on them nor shall they grieve .
They rejoice in the grace of Allah and His bounty and in the fact that Allah does not waste the reward of the believers .
As for those who listened to Allah and the Messenger after they had suffered defeat , for those of them who did good and feared Allah is a great reward .
Those to whom the people said : &quot; Behold , the people have already gathered against you , fear them ! &quot; But they grew stronger in faith and said : &quot; Allah is sufficient for us , and He is the best Advocate . &quot;
Therefore they returned with the grace of Allah and bounty without any harm befalling them , and they followed the good pleasure of Allah ; and Allah is full of great bounty .
That Satan only wants to make his helpers fear ; but fear them not , but fear Me if you are believers .
And do not be grieved by those who strive after disbelief ; surely they can never harm Allah . Allah will not give them a share in the Hereafter , and for them is a great chastisement .
Lo ! whoever sells faith for disbelief , they cannot harm Allah , and for them is a grievous chastisement .
And let not the disbelievers think that what We grant them in term is good for them ; We do not give them but a long life so that they may grow into sin ; and for them is a shameful chastisement .
Allah does not intend to leave the believers in the position in which you are until He has separated the wicked from the good .
And Allah does not intend to reveal to you the unseen things , but Allah chooses from His messengers whom He wills , so believe in Allah and His messengers ; and if you believe and guard ( against evil ) , you shall have a great reward .
And let not those who are avaricious with what Allah has given them of His bounty think that it is better for them .
Nay , it is for them to do evil ; on the Day of Resurrection they shall wear as a collar that which they were avaricious .
And to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth , and Allah knows what you do .
Lo ! Allah hath heard the word of those who said : Lo ! Allah is poor and we are rich .
We want to write down their words and their unjust killing of the prophets and say : &quot; Taste the chastisement of burning .
This is for that which your hands sent before , and Allah is not unjust to the servants .
Who say : Lo ! Allah hath enjoined us not to believe any messenger before he bring us a sacrifice which consumes the fire . Say : Already before me came unto you messengers with clear communications and what ye speak of : why then did ye murder them , if ye are truthful ?
And if they accuse you of falsehood , then indeed messengers before you have been accused of falsehood , even though they came with clear signs and the Scriptures and the Book of Light .
Every soul will taste death , and you will be given your reward in full on the Day of Resurrection ; and whoever is removed from the Fire and led to Paradise , let him be happy .
And earthly life is nothing but a deceptive usage .
Verily ye shall be tried in your possessions and in yourselves , and verily ye shall hear many hurtful utterances from those to whom the Scripture was given before you and from those who associate companions with Allah .
But if you are patient and righteous , this is most surely a matter of determination .
And when Allah made a covenant with those to whom the Book was given , they threw it over their shoulders and sold it for a very small price , and evil is that which they buy ( for it ) .
Thou shalt not think that those who rejoice in their deed and desire to be glorified for what they have not done have escaped the punishment ; they shall have a grievous punishment .
And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth , and Allah has power over all things .
Verily in the creation of the heavens and the earth , and in the alternation of the night and the day , there are true signs for those who understand .
Who remember Allah standing and sitting and lying on their sides , and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth : Our Lord ! Thou didst not create this in vain .
Blessed be Thou , therefore guard us from the chastisement of the fire .
Our Lord ! surely whoever You lead into the Fire , you lead him to disgrace , and the unjust have no helpers .
Our Lord ! verily we heard a crier invoking faith , saying : Believe in your Lord , and thus we believe .
Our Lord , forgive us therefore our sins , and blot out our iniquities , and let us pass away with the upright .
Our Lord , and give us what You have promised us through Your messengers , and lead us not in disgrace on the Day of Resurrection ; surely You do not break ( Your ) promise . &quot;
Lo ! I do not cause to perish among you any of the works of those who work , whether of men or women ; some of you are from others .
And those who emigrated and were driven out of their homes , and suffered on My way and fought and fell , I will surely blot out their iniquities , and I will surely bring them into gardens through which rivers flow , as a reward from Allah . &quot; And with Allah is the best reward .
Do not be deceived by the conduct of unbelievers in the countries .
A tiny usage then is Gahannam their lodging , and bad is the camp !
But whoever fears his Lord , they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow ; they shall abide therein eternally , an entertainment from Allah , and what is with Allah is better for the righteous .
Indeed , among the People of the Scripture there are those who believe in Allah and that which has been revealed to you and that which has been revealed to them , and they are humble to Allah and do not sell His communications for a small price .
Those have their reward with their Lord . Lo ! Allah is swift in reckoning .
O you who believe , exercise patience and strive patiently and be patient and fear Allah ; perhaps you will be successful .
O mankind ! fear your Lord , Who created you from a single soul , and from it He created its mate , and from them He gave birth to many men and women .
And fear Allah , in Whose name you ask one another , and ( in the name of ) your kinship .
Lo ! Allah watches over you .
And give to the orphans their wealth , and do not exchange ( your ) evil for ( their ) good , and do not consume their wealth with yours ; surely this is a great crime .
And if ye fear that ye are not righteous to the orphans , marry that which seemeth good to you of women , two , three , or four ; and if ye fear that ye are not fair , marry one or that which is in your right hand .
This is the best way to avoid injustice .
And give the women their bridal gift as a gift . And if they remit to you any of it , you can safely use it for good .
And give not to the foolish your wealth which Allah has given you for sustenance ; feed them thereof and clothe them , and speak to them kindly .
And test the orphans until they reach maturity , and if you perceive in them reason , then give them their wealth , and do not consume them in a lavish and hasty manner lest they grow up .
And whoever is rich , let him restrain himself , and whoever is poor , let him eat in equity .
And when you give them their wealth , bear witness to it before them , but it is sufficient that Allah should give account .
Men are entitled to part of the inheritance of their parents and relatives , and women are also entitled to part of the inheritance of their parents and relatives .
Be it little or much . ( This applies ) as a prescribed portion .
And when relatives and orphans and the poor are present at the division , give them some of it and speak kindly to them .
And let those who , if they leave a weak offspring , fear for them ; let Allah fear them and speak words of justice .
Lo ! those who eat up unjustly the wealth of the orphans , they eat up fire in their bellies , and they burn in the fire of hell .
Allah prescribes to you concerning your children : On one male ( in inheritance ) comes as much as on two females .
But if there are more than two women , they shall receive two thirds of the inheritance ; if there is only one , they shall have half .
And every parent shall receive the sixth part of the inheritance if he has children , but if he has no children , and his parents inherit him , his mother shall have the third part ; and if he has brothers , his mother shall receive the sixth part after payment of any inheritance or debt .
Your parents and your children do not know which of the two is nearer to you .
This is a commandment from Allah ; surely Allah is Knowing , Wise .
And you shall receive half of what your wives leave if they have no children ; but if they have children , you shall receive a quarter of their inheritance , after any inheritance or debt they may have bequeathed ; and they shall have a quarter of your inheritance if you have no children ; and if you have children , they shall receive an eighth of your inheritance , after any inheritance or debt you may have bequeathed .
And if it is a man or a woman whose inheritance is to be divided , and who has neither parents nor children , but a brother or a sister , they shall receive one @-@ sixth of each .
But if there are more , then let them divide a third , according to any inheritance or debt they may have , without interference , an ordinance from Allah , and Allah is Knowing , Gentle .
These are the boundaries of Allah , and He introduces him who obeys Allah and His Messenger into gardens beneath which rivers flow , wherein they shall abide forever ; and that is the great bliss .
And whoever refuses obedience to Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His boundaries , He will bring him into the Fire , wherein he shall abide forever , and he shall have an ignominious punishment .
And if any of your wives commit fornication , call four of you as witnesses against them ; if they bear witness , then shut them up in their houses until death overtakes them or Allah gives them a way out .
And if two of you commit it , then do them harm .
But if they repent and make amends , then turn away from them ; surely Allah is Gracious and Merciful .
Only those who do evil in ignorance , and then turn back in time , can expect forgiveness from Allah . To these Allah turns again , and Allah is Knowing and Wise .
But those who commit evil deeds do not expect forgiveness , and those who only say when they die : &quot; Now I turn back . &quot; Nor do those who die while they are unbelievers .
For them We have prepared a painful punishment .
O you who believe ! It is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will , and do not prevent them ( from marrying another ) to take a portion of what you have given them , unless they have manifestly committed fornication .
Treat them with kindness , and if you loathe them , perhaps you loathe what Allah has invested in abundant wealth .
And if you want to exchange one wife for another , and you have given a gift to one of them , take nothing from him .
Will ye take it away in slander and manifest sin ?
And how could you take it away when you were already with one another and they made a firm covenant with you ?
And do not marry any women whom your fathers had married , unless it happened before ; surely it is a disgrace and an abomination and an evil way .
Your mothers , your daughters , your sisters , your fathers &quot; and mothers &quot; sisters , your brothers &quot; and sisters &quot; daughters , your nursing mothers who nursed you , and your lactating sisters , and the mothers of your wives and stepdaughters who are under your protection , from your wives with whom you have carried out ( the marriage ) ; but if you have not done this with them , it is not a sin .
And the wives of your sons of your birth , and you shall not have two sisters together unless it has already been done . Lo ! Allah is Forgiving and Merciful .
And ( you are forbidden ) married women except those whom you possess by right .
This is the command of Allah for you .
And besides this it is lawful for you to covet women with your money , for marriage and not for fornication .
And give their bridal gifts to those whom you have enjoyed .
This is a precept , but it shall not be a sin if you make an agreement with one another beyond the precept .
Lo ! Allah is Knowing and Wise .
And whoever among you is not able to marry believing women , let him marry from the possession of your right hand among your believing handmaids ; and Allah knows your faith well ; you are one from another .
Therefore marry them with the permission of their families , and give them their bridal gift according to equity , if they are chaste , neither commit fornication , nor secretly take lovers .
And if , after they are married , they are guilty of fornication , then let them suffer half the punishment prescribed for free women .
This ( relief ) is for those of you who fear distress .
That ye exercise patience is better for you ; and Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
Allah will make clear to you the ways of those who were before you , and guide you therein , and turn to you in mercy ; and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
And Allah will turn to you in mercy , and those who follow the low desires want you to turn aside completely .
Allah will lighten your burden , for man is created weak .
O believers ! do not deceive one another about your wealth ; it is otherwise if it is a matter of a business which you enter into by mutual agreement , and do not kill one another ; Allah is Merciful to you .
If any one does this transgressively and unjustly , We will cause him to burn in the fire , and that is easy for Allah .
If you abstain from the more severe of the things forbidden to you , We will remove from you your lesser evils and bring you to an honorable place .
And do not covet what Allah has distinguished some of you from others .
The men shall receive their share according to their merit , and the women shall receive their share according to their merit .
And ask Allah for His bounty .
Lo ! Allah hath perfect knowledge of all things .
And to each one We have appointed heirs for what parents and relatives and those with whom your oaths have confirmed a covenant have bequeathed .
So give them their share . Lo ! Allah is Witness of everything .
Men are in charge of women because Allah has made some superior to others and because they spend of their wealth .
Therefore , virtuous women are the obedient and those who keep secrets with the help of Allah .
And those whose stubbornness you fear : admonish them , avoid them in the bed of marriage , and beat them .
And if they obey you , seek no excuse against them .
Lo ! Allah is Exalted and Great .
And if you fear a rift between the two , then send a referee from his family and a referee from her family .
If they wish to be reconciled , Allah will make peace between them . Lo ! Allah is Knowing , Knowing .
Serve Allah and associate nothing with Him , and be good to your parents and relatives , the orphans , the poor , the neighbor , whether of kin or of strangers , the companion by the side , the son of the Way , and the slave whom you possess by right .
Lo ! Allah loveth not the haughty , the boastful ,
Who are avaricious and enjoin men to be avaricious and conceal what Allah has given them in His grace , and We have prepared for the unbelievers a shameful chastisement .
Those who spend their wealth so that they may be seen by men , and do not believe in Allah and the Last Day ; and whoever has Satan as his neighbor , he has an evil neighbor .
But what will happen to them if they believe in Allah and the Last Day and spend of what Allah has given them ?
And Allah is Knower of them .
Lo ! Allah doeth no wrong , not even by the weight of an atom ; and if there is any good deed , He multiplies it and bestows on Himself a mighty reward .
And what if We bring from every people a witness and bring you as a witness against them ?
On that Day , those who disbelieved and refused obedience to the Messenger will desire that the earth be levelled over them , and they will not be able to hide a word from Allah .
O you who believe ! do not approach prayer when you are drunk until you understand what you say , nor in a state of impurity except as travelers on the way , until you have made up your mind .
And if you are sick or on a journey , or one of you comes back from necessity , or if you have touched the women and find no water , seek good sand and then rub your faces and hands . Lo ! Allah is Forgiving , Forgiving .
Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Scripture has been given ? They buy error and desire that you stray also from the way .
And Allah knoweth your enemies best , and Allah sufficeth for guardians , and Allah sufficeth for helpers .
There are some among the Jews who twist words from their positions , saying , &quot; We hear and we obey not , &quot; and &quot; Hear without being heard , &quot; and &quot; Be indulgent to us , &quot; lying with their tongues and blaspheming faith .
And if they had said : &quot; We hear and we obey , &quot; and &quot; Hear , &quot; and &quot; Look upon us graciously , &quot; it would have been better for them and more upright .
But Allah has cursed them as a punishment for their disbelief ; therefore they believe but little .
O you who have been given the Scripture , believe in that which We have revealed and which confirms that which is before you before We destroy some faces and cast them on their backs or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath people , and surely the command of Allah is carried out .
Lo ! Allah will not forgive that associations should be made with Him , but He forgives that which is inferior to that which He pleases .
And whoever associates with Allah has indeed committed a great sin .
Have you not seen those who speak for themselves ?
But it is Allah who purifies whom He pleases , and they are not wronged by a single thread .
See how they fabricate lies against Allah , and that alone is sufficient as a manifest sin .
Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Scripture has been given ? They believe in magic and idols , and they say of the disbelievers : They are better guided in doctrine than the believers .
These are the ones whom Allah has cursed , and for him whom Allah curses , you will not find a helper .
Or do they have a share in the dominion ?
Then they would not even give humans as much as the groove of a date core .
Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them out of His grace ?
Surely We gave the House of Abraham the Book and Wisdom , and We gave them a mighty kingdom .
And some of them believed in it , but others turned away from it , and indeed it is evil enough as a fire of flame .
As for those who do not believe in Our communications , We will cause them to burn in the fire . Whenever their skin is burned , We will give them a different skin so that they may taste the chastisement . Lo ! Allah is Mighty , Wise .
But as for those who believe and do righteous deeds , We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow , in which they shall abide forever ; there shall they have pure wives , and We will admit them to a benevolent place with ample shade .
Allah commands you to return the goods entrusted to their owners ; and when you judge between men , judge by justice .
Verily , what Allah admonishes you to do is fair ; surely Allah is Hearing , Seeing .
O you who believe ! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you , and if you dispute about anything , bring it before Allah and the Messenger , if you believe in Allah and the Last Day .
This is the best and most likely to end well .
Have you not seen those who claimed to believe in what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed before you ? They want to seek from the devil a just decision , when they have been commanded not to believe in it , and Satan wants to confuse them far .
And when it is said unto them , Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and unto the Messenger , thou seest the hypocrites turning away from thee in disgust .
But how when mischief befalls them for the former deeds of their hands , they come to you and swear by Allah : We only wished to do well and to mediate .
These are they of whom Allah knows well what is in their hearts .
So turn away from them and admonish them , and speak to them a strong word about themselves .
And We have not sent a messenger without obedience to him by the leave of Allah .
And if they had come to thee after they had transgressed against themselves , and had they asked forgiveness of Allah , and if the Messenger had asked forgiveness of them , they would certainly have found Allah Forgiving , Merciful .
But no , not by your Lord ; they are not believers until they make you a judge of all that is contentious between them , and then they find in their hearts no objection to your decision and submit with submission .
If We had ordained to them , &quot; Kill yourselves or leave your houses , &quot; they would not have done it , except a few of them ; but if they had done what they had been asked to do , it would most certainly have been better for them and strengthened ( their faith ) .
Then We would certainly give them a great reward from Us .
And We would certainly guide them on the right path .
And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger , let him be of those to whom Allah bestows His bounty , and of the prophets , the truthful , the witnesses , and the righteous , what good companions !
Such is a favor from Allah , and Allah suffices as the Knower .
O you who believe ! Be on your guard , then go out either by force or all together .
Of you is he who is left behind , and if calamity befalls you , he says : Surely Allah has been gracious to me that I was not with them .
But when a favor is bestowed upon you from Allah , he says as if there were no friendship between you and him : &quot; If I had been with them , I would have achieved great success . &quot;
So let those who sell earthly life at the price of the hereafter fight for the cause of Allah .
And whoever strives in the way of Allah but is killed or conquers , We will give him a great reward .
And why will ye not fight in the cause of Allah and in the cause of the weak men and women and children who say : Our Lord ! bring us out of this city whose inhabitants are oppressors , and give us from Thee a protector , and give us from Thee a helper ?
Those who believe fight for the cause of Allah , and those who do not believe fight for the cause of the devil ; therefore fight against the followers of Satan !
Verily the cunning of Satan is weak .
Have you not seen those to whom it was said : Hold back your hands and keep up prayer and give the zakah ?
But when war was ordained for them , a party of them feared men as if they were afraid of Allah or more so , and they said : Our Lord ! why hast thou ordained war for us ?
Wouldn &apos;t you like to give us some more time ? &apos;
Say : The benefit of this world is small , and the Hereafter will be better for those who guard ( against evil ) , and you shall not be wronged by a single strand .
Wherever you are , death befalls you , even if you were in high castles .
And when good befalls them , they say : This is from Allah ; and when evil befalls them , they say : This is from you .
Say : Everything is from Allah .
Why do these people hardly understand what they are being told ?
Whatever good touches you is from Allah , and whatever evil touches you is from yourself .
And We have sent you as a messenger to men , and Allah suffices as a witness .
Whoever obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah , and if anyone turns away , We have not sent you to guard them .
And they say : Obedience ; but when they depart from thee , a party of them rumour of something other than what thou sayest , and Allah records what they rumour .
So turn away from them and trust in Allah , and Allah is sufficient as guardian .
They do not worry about the Quran .
If it were from anyone other than Allah , they would certainly find much contradiction therein .
And when they hear something concerning security or fear , they make it known .
But if they had brought it before the Messenger and those in authority among them , those of them who could reveal it would certainly have known it . Had it not been for the favor of Allah and His mercy upon you , you would all have followed Satan , except for a few exceptions .
Fight therefore in the way of Allah , you will not be held responsible for anything but yourselves , and encourage the believers to fight .
Perhaps Allah will restrain the power of those who disbelieve , and the power of Allah is greater and more severe in punishment .
Whoever intercedes righteously shall have a share therein , and whoever intercedes wickedly shall receive what is due thereto ; and Allah has power over all things .
And if you are greeted with a greeting , greet again with a more beautiful greeting , or answer him .
Lo ! Allah is Accountable of all things .
( He is ) Allah ; there is no god but He .
He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection of which there is no doubt ; and who is more trustworthy in the statement than Allah ?
What has happened to you , then , that you are divided into two parties in the matter of hypocrites ?
And Allah has rejected them because of what they have done .
Do you then guide whom Allah has sent to destruction ?
And for him whom Allah causes to perish , you will not find a way .
They desire that you disbelieve as they disbelieve , so that you all become equal .
Therefore , do not take any protectors from them until they walk in the way of Allah .
And when they turn back , seize them and slay them wherever you find them , and take none of them for a protector or a helper .
Except those who come to a people with whom you have a covenant , and who come to you because their hearts are afraid of fighting against you or against their own people .
And if Allah had willed , He could have given them power over you , then surely they would have fought against you .
Therefore , if they turn away from you and do not fight against you but offer you peace , then Allah has not given you any cause against them .
You will find others who want to be safe from you and from their people . Whenever they are led back to hostility , they fall headlong into it .
So if they do not turn away from you , nor offer you peace , nor restrain their hands , seize them and kill them wherever you find them .
Against these We have given you full authority .
It is not for any believer to kill another believer except by mistake . And whoever kills a believer by mistake , he shall deliver a believing slave and pay blood money to his heirs unless they remit it out of charity .
But if he was of a people who are your enemy , and he who killed him is a believer , let him deliver a believing slave ; but if he was of a people with whom you have a covenant , let him pay blood money to his heirs and release a believing slave .
If he cannot , then fasting two months in a row is forgiveness from Allah . And Allah is Knowing , Wise .
And whoever kills a believer intentionally , his reward is Hell wherein he abides forever . Allah will be angry with him and reject him and prepare for him a grievous punishment .
O you who believe ! when you go forth in the way of Allah , make a thorough investigation and do not say to anyone who offers you the salutation of peace : You are not a believer .
Ye seek the riches of earthly life , but with Allah is abundance of good .
That is how you once were , but then Allah has bestowed His bounty on you ; therefore make proper enquiries .
Lo ! Allah is well acquainted with what ye do .
Those of the believers who remain at home , except the infirm , and those who spend their wealth and their blood in the cause of Allah , are not equal .
Allah has elevated by one degree those who fight with their wealth and blood above those who stay at home .
Allah has promised good to each of them , but Allah has rewarded the fighters with a great reward before those who are left behind .
Degrees from Him and forgiveness and mercy ; and Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
To those who have committed injustice against themselves , when the angels recall them , they say : &quot; In what circumstances have you found yourselves ? &quot;
They reply : &apos; We have been treated as weak in this country . &apos;
Then they say : Was the earth of Allah not wide enough for you that you could have migrated therein ?
They are the ones whose lodging will be Gahannam , and the end is terrible !
The oppressed men , women and children , who have no opportunity and no way out , are exempt from this .
These are they whom Allah will forgive ; for Allah is Forgiving , Forgiving .
And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah , he will find on earth sufficient places of refuge and abundance .
And whoever leaves his abode and emigrates to Allah and His Messenger and is overtaken by death , Allah provides for his reward . And Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And when ye pass through the land , it is no sin for you if ye shorten prayer , if ye fear lest the unbelievers afflict you ; surely the unbelievers are your manifest enemies .
And if you are among them and lead the prayer for them , then let a party of them stand with you , but let them carry their weapons .
And when they bow down , let them come behind you , and let another party which has not yet prayed pray with you ; but let them be on guard and carry their weapons ; and the disbelievers would like you to disregard your weapons and your baggage , so that they might attack you all at once .
And it is not a sin for you to lay down your weapons if you suffer from rain or are ill , but be on your guard .
Lo ! Allah hath prepared for the disbelievers a shameful chastisement .
And when ye have established prayer , remember Allah standing and sitting and reclining .
And when ye are secure , establish prayer ; verily , prayer at appointed times is a duty for the believers .
And do not cease to seek out the party ( of disbelievers ) .
If you suffer , they suffer just as you suffer .
But you hope from Allah what they do not hope .
And Allah is Knowing , Wise .
Lo ! We have revealed to thee the Book with truth , that thou mayest judge between men as Allah hath shown thee ; so be not a defender of the unfaithful .
And ask forgiveness of Allah . Lo ! Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And do not stand up for those who deceive themselves . Lo ! Allah loveth not him who is a deceiver , a sinner .
They want to hide from men , but they cannot hide from Allah , and He is with them when they prepare for evil intrigues , and Allah is Acquainted with what they do .
So you have interceded for them in this earthly life , but who will intercede for them before Allah on the Day of Resurrection ? Or who will be their protector ?
And whoever does evil or transgresses against himself , and then asks forgiveness of Allah , finds Allah Forgiving , Merciful .
And whoever commits a sin , he commits it against himself ; and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
And whoever commits a fault or a sin and then blames it on an innocent person bears a slander and a manifest sin .
And had it not been for the grace and mercy of Allah , a company of them would have decided to lead you astray , but they lead themselves astray , and they cannot harm you at all , and Allah has revealed to you the Book and Wisdom , and has taught you what you did not know , and the favor of Allah which He has bestowed on you is indeed great .
There is nothing good in many of their conferences except in those which exhort to charity , or to kindness , or to peacemaking among men .
And whoever does this seeking the pleasure of Allah , We will give him a great reward .
But whoever disobeys the Messenger after the right path has become clear to him , and follows a path other than that of the believers , We will cause him to be persecuted for that which he persecutes , and then cause him to burn in hell , and evil is his end .
Lo ! Allah will not forgive that associations should be made with Him , but He forgives that which is inferior to that which He pleases .
And whoever associates with Allah has indeed gone astray .
Verily , instead of Him they invoke only female beings ; but they invoke only a rebellious Satan .
whom Allah has cursed and who replied : &quot; I will take a portion of Your servants .
And I will lead them astray and excite their hopes and command them to slit the ears of the cattle , and I will command them and they will change the creation of Allah .
And whoever takes Satan instead of Allah as his protector , he has surely suffered a manifest loss .
He makes promises to them and arouses desires in them , and what Satan promises them is deceit .
These are the lodging places of Gahannam , and they will not find a way out of it .
And as for those who believe and do righteous deeds , We will bring them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow , therein they shall abide for ever and ever a true promise of Allah ; and who is more trustworthy in the statement than Allah ?
It is not according to your desires , nor according to the desires of the People of the Scripture . Whoever does evil will be repaid , and he will not find for himself besides Allah any guardian or helper .
But those who do what is right , whether male or female , and believe , will enter Paradise and will not be wronged in the least .
And who has a religion more beautiful than he who submits to Allah and does good and follows the faith of Abraham , the upright ?
And Allah took Abraham as a friend .
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth ; and Allah embraces all things .
And they ask you for instruction about women .
Say : Allah has instructed you concerning them , and what is recited to you in the Book concerns the orphan girls to whom you do not give what is prescribed for them , and whom you desire to marry , and the weak among the children , and that you intercede for the orphans with equity .
Whatever good you do , Allah is Knowing of it . &quot;
And if a wife fears her husband to be rude or indifferent , it shall be no sin for them both if they make reconciliation with one another in a manner that is proper ; for reconciliation is good .
People are prepared for greed .
But if you do good and guard ( against evil ) , then Allah is Aware of what you do .
And you cannot do justice between women , however much you may wish .
But incline not to ( one ) completely , so that you leave the other , as it were , in limbo .
And if ye make amends and guard ( against evil ) , Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And if they separate , Allah will satisfy both of them out of His bounty ; surely Allah is Beneficent and Wise .
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth .
And We have enjoined on those who were given the Scripture before you , and We have enjoined on you to fear Allah .
But if ye disbelieve , then to Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth ; and Allah is not dependent on any and worthy of praise .
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth , and Allah is sufficient as a Protector .
If He wills , He will remove you , ye men , and bring others ; and Allah is Exalted in Might .
Whoever desires the reward of this world is the reward of this and that world with Allah ; and Allah is Hearing , Seeing .
O you who believe ! Be watchful of justice and be witnesses to Allah , even when it is against yourselves or against parents and relatives .
Whether one is rich or poor , Allah is nearer to the two , so do not follow the personal inclination that you may do justice ; but if you pervert ( the truth ) or turn away ( from it ) , Allah is Acquainted with what you do .
O you who have believed ! Believe in Allah and His Messenger and in the Book which He has revealed to His Messenger and in the Book which He revealed before .
And whoever does not believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His apostles and the Last Day , he has most surely gone astray .
Lo ! those who believe and then disbelieve , then believe again , then disbelieve again and become more vehement in disbelief , Allah will never forgive them nor guide them .
Proclaim to the hypocrites the &quot; glad tidings &quot; that they will have a painful chastisement
Those who take disbelievers as protectors from the believers . Do they seek power and respect from them ?
Lo ! to Allah belongs all majesty .
And He has already revealed to you in the Scripture that if you hear that the communications of Allah are denied and mocked , you will not sit with them until they turn to another conversation ; otherwise you would be like them .
Lo ! Allah will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers together in Hell .
who are waiting for news of you . If you are granted a victory from Allah , they say : Were we not with you ?
But if the disbelievers have a share , they say ( to the disbelievers ) : Have we not gained the upper hand over you and protected you from the believers ?
Allah will then judge between you on the Day of Resurrection , and Allah will never give the disbelievers the upper hand over the believers .
Lo ! the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah , but He will deceive them .
And when they stand up to prayer , they do not rise unwillingly , that they may be seen by men , and they do not remember Allah very often .
Undecided , they oscillate between these and those and reach neither of them .
And whomsoever Allah causes to err , for him thou wilt never find a way out .
O you who believe ! do not take disbelievers as guardians instead of believers .
Will ye give Allah manifest proofs against yourselves ?
Surely the hypocrites are in the lowest depths of the Fire , and you will not find for them a helper .
Except those who repent and make amends and take refuge in Allah , and those who turn only to Allah with their faith ; so these are of the believers ; and Allah will give the believers a great reward .
What will Allah make of your punishment if you are grateful and believe ?
And Allah is Thankful , Knowing .
Allah loveth not that evil words should be uttered aloud , except when wrong be done to one . Lo ! Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Whether you say good things , or conceal them , or forgive evil , Allah is Forgiving , Mighty .
Lo ! those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers , and make a separation between Allah and His Messengers , and say : We believe in some and reject others , and wish to take an intermediate course .
These are the unbelievers in the true sense , and We have prepared for the unbelievers an ignominious chastisement .
But those who believe in Allah and His Messengers , and make no distinction between them , it is He who will reward them ; and Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
The People of the Book require of you that you cause a Book to come down to them from heaven .
But they asked of Moses something greater than this , saying : &quot; Show us Allah clearly . &quot;
Then the lightning struck them because of their sacrilege .
Then they took the calf after clear signs had come to them , but We forgave them .
And We bestowed upon Moses manifest proof .
And We raised the mountain above them on the occasion of the covenant with them , and We said to them : Enter by the gate in submission , and We said to them : Do not transgress the Sabbath commandment , and We made with them a strong covenant .
And when they broke their covenant and disbelieved in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unlawfully and said : Our hearts are behind a veil , but no , Allah has closed them because of their disbelief , so they believe only a little .
And because of their unbelief and because of their assertion , which they made against Mary with an enormous lie ,
And because of their saying , &quot; We have slain the Messiah , Jesus the son of Mary , the Messenger of Allah , &quot; when they had neither slain him nor crucified him , but this was only feigned to them ; and those who disagree in this matter are most certainly in doubt about it ; they have no knowledge of it but follow only a presumption ; and they have not killed him with certainty .
Rather , Allah has exalted him to Himself , and Allah is Exalted in Might , Wise .
And there is none of the People of the Scripture who will not believe in it before his death , and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them .
And because of the sin of the Jews We forbade them good things that were lawful to them , and because they put many obstacles in the way of Allah .
and because they took interest , though it was forbidden to them , and because they ate up the goods of men unlawfully .
And We have prepared for the unbelievers among them a painful chastisement .
But to those of them who have a thorough knowledge , and to those who believe in what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed before you , and to those who establish prayer and pay the Zakah , and to those who believe in Allah and the Last Day , We will grant them a great reward .
We have revealed to you how We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him , and We revealed to Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , the tribes ( of Israel ) , Jesus , Job , Jonah , Aaron and Solomon , and We have given to David a Zabur .
They are messengers of which We have already told you , and messengers of which We have not told you , and Allah has indeed spoken to Moses .
( They are ) messengers and bearers of good news and warners , so that after the messengers people have no reason against Allah .
And Allah is Mighty , Wise .
But Allah testifies by what He has revealed to you that He sent it with His knowledge , and the angels bear witness ; and Allah suffices as a witness .
But those who disbelieve and turn away from the way of Allah , most surely they have gone astray .
For those who disbelieve and have done wrong , Allah will not forgive them nor guide them to a path .
Except the way to hell in which they will abide for ever ; and this is easy for Allah .
O mankind ! the Messenger has now come to you with the truth from your Lord ; therefore believe that is good for you ; but if you disbelieve , to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth ; and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
O People of the Scripture ! Do not exaggerate in your religion and say nothing of Allah but the truth .
Indeed , the Messiah , Jesus , son of Mary , is only the Messenger of Allah and His Word which He has sent to Mary and of His Spirit .
Therefore believe in Allah and His messengers , and say not : Three . Leave it ( that ) is better for you .
Allah is but one God . Far be it from His glory to attribute a child to Him .
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth , and Allah is sufficient as Advocate .
The Messiah will never disdain being servants of Allah , nor the angels close to Him ; and whoever disdains worship Him and feels exalted to it , He will gather them all to Himself .
But to those who believe and do righteous deeds , He will give the full reward and more of His bounty ; but to those who despise and are proud , He will punish them grievously .
And besides Allah they find no guardian or helper .
O mankind ! to you has indeed come a clear proof from your Lord , and We have sent down to you a clear light .
But as for those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him , He will accept them into His mercy and bounty and guide them to Himself on the right path .
They ask you for instruction .
Say : Allah teaches you concerning kinship : If a man dies and leaves no children , but has a sister , then she shall inherit half of his inheritance , and he shall inherit it it if she has no children .
But if there are two ( sisters ) , they will receive two @-@ thirds of his inheritance .
And if they are brothers and sisters , men and women , there is as much on one male sex as on two females . &quot;
Allah makes it plain to you that you should not err ; and Allah is Knower of all things .
O you who believe ! Fulfill the covenants .
Every kind of cattle except that which is revealed to you ( in the Scripture ) is permitted to you ; not that you may consider hunting lawful while you go on pilgrimage ; surely Allah judges as He wills .
O ye who believe ! profane not the religion for the glory of Allah , nor the sacred month , nor the sacrificial animals , nor the sacred sacrificial animals , nor those who go to the sacred house seeking favor and pleasure from their Lord .
When you have finished the consecration , you shall hunt ; you shall not be moved by the hatred which you harbor against a people because they have kept you from the sacred mosque , so that you shall transgress .
And help one another in righteousness and piety , but do not help one another in sin and transgression .
And fear Allah ; surely Allah is severe in punishment .
Forbidden to you are that which is dead , and blood , and pork , and that about which any other than the name of Allah has been invoked ; that which is strangled , that which is beaten to death , that which is thrown down to death , or pushed to death , and that which predators have eaten , besides that which you have slain , and that which has been slain on a pagan sacrificial stone ; and ( forbidden to you ) that you seek by arrows to know the fate .
This is an outrage .
Today the unbelievers have resigned themselves to your faith ; so fear not them but fear Me .
Today I have perfected your religion for you and completed My mercy upon you and have chosen Islam for you to believe in .
But whoever is compelled by famine without a sinful inclination , Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
They ask you what they are allowed to do .
Say : All good things are lawful unto you , and what ye have taught beasts of prey , training them to hunt , and teaching them that which Allah hath taught you . So eat of what they catch for you , and pronounce the name of Allah therein .
This day all good things are lawful to you , and the food of those to whom the Scripture was given is lawful to you as your food is lawful to them .
And honourable believing women and honourable women among the people to whom the Scripture was given before you when you give them the bridal gift , and only for marriage and not for fornication and secret love .
And whoever disbelieves , his deed is without doubt vain , and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers .
O you who believe ! When you come to prayer , wash your faces and your hands to the elbows and stroke your heads and wash your feet to the ankles .
And when you are in a state of uncleanness , purify yourselves .
And if you are sick or on a journey , or one of you comes back from need , or if you have touched women and find no water , seek clean sand and rub your face and hands with it .
Allah does not want to afflict you with difficulties , but He only wants to purify you and fulfill His mercy on you , that you may be grateful .
And remember the favor of Allah on you and the covenant He made with you when you said : We hear and obey .
And fear Allah ; surely Allah knows what the hearts conceal .
Stand up for Allah and be witnesses of justice , and hatred of any group shall not lead you to do other than what is just .
Be righteous , this is closer to the fear of God .
And fear Allah ; surely Allah is Acquainted with what you do .
Allah has promised those who believe and do good that they will receive forgiveness and a great reward .
But those who disbelieve and disbelieve in Our communications will be companions of the Gahim .
O you who believe ! Remember the grace of Allah upon you when a group sought to stretch out their hands upon you .
But he withheld their hands from you , and fear Allah ; let the believers trust in Allah .
Lo ! Allah had made a covenant with the Children of Israel , and We raised up twelve leaders out of them .
And Allah said : &quot; Behold , I am with you , if you establish prayer and pay the zakah and believe in My messengers and support them and give a good loan to Allah , then I will redeem your iniquities and bring you into gardens beneath which rivers flow .
But whoever among you then falls back into unbelief has strayed from the right path .
Because they broke their covenant , We cursed them and hardened their hearts .
They distorted the Scripture in its proper places , and they have forgotten a part of what they were reminded of .
And you will not stop discovering treachery on their side , except for some of them .
So forgive them and turn away . Lo ! Allah loveth those who do good .
And even with those who say , &quot; We are Christians , &quot; We made a covenant , and they too have forgotten a part of what they were reminded of .
Therefore We aroused enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection , and Allah will make them know what they have done .
O People of the Scripture ! Our Messenger has now come to you to reveal to you much of what you have concealed from the Scripture , and to be tolerant of much .
Lo ! unto thee hath come a light from Allah and a clear Book .
Thus Allah guides those who seek His pleasure into the paths of peace , and by His permission He guides them out of darkness into light and guides them into a straight path .
Lo ! those who say : Allah is the Messiah , the son of Mary .
Say : Who can do anything against Allah if He wants to destroy the Messiah , the son of Mary , his mother and all those who are on earth ?
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them .
He creates what He pleases , and Allah has power over all things .
And the Jews and the Christians said : We are the sons of Allah and His favorites .
Say : Why then does He punish you for your sins ?
Nay , ye are men of those whom He created . &quot;
He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases ; and to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them , and to Him is the return .
O People of the Book ! Our Messenger has now come to you after a period of time between the Messengers to enlighten you so that you may not say : There has not come to us a bearer of good news or a warner .
So there has indeed come to you a bearer of good news and a warner , and Allah has power over all things .
O my people ! remember the bounty of Allah to you when He raised up from among you prophets and made you kings and gave you what He did not give to anyone else in the world .
O my people ! enter the sacred land which Allah hath ordained for you , and turn not aside ( from it ) , for then ye will return as losers .
O Musa ! surely there is a tyrannical people there , and we shall not enter it until they have left it .
But when they leave , we &apos;ll move in . &apos;
Then said two men of those who feared Allah and to whom Allah had bestowed His mercy : Enter the gate and turn against them ; when ye have entered , ye shall be victorious .
And trust in Allah if you are believers . &quot;
They said : O Musa ! We will never enter it while they are there .
Go then with your Lord and fight , and we shall sit here . &quot;
He said : &quot; I have only power over myself and my brother ; therefore separate us from the rebellious people . &quot;
He said : Surely it ( the land ) shall be forbidden to them for forty years , and they shall wander in the earth .
And do not grieve because of the rebellious people . &quot;
And verily read to them the story of the two sons of Adam , when they both offered a sacrifice , and it was accepted by one and not accepted by the other .
Then he said : &quot; I will surely kill you . &quot; He replied : &quot; Allah accepts only of those who guard ( against evil ) .
Though thou stretch forth thy hand against me to slay me , I will not stretch forth my hand against thee to slay thee . I fear Allah , the Lord of the worlds .
I want you to bear the burden of my sin and your sin , and to be among the inhabitants of the Fire ; and this is the reward of the wicked . &quot;
But he succumbed to the urge to kill his brother ; so he killed him and became one of the losers .
So Allah sent a raven scavenging on the ground to show him how to hide the corpse of his brother . He said : Woe to me !
Am I not even able to be like that raven and hide my brother &apos;s body ? &quot; And then he became remorseful .
Therefore , We have decreed to the Children of Israel that if anyone kills a man without murdering him , or without any harm having been done in the land , it shall be as if he had killed all mankind ; and if anyone keeps a man alive , it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind .
And Our messengers came to them with clear signs , yet even after that many of them committed riots in the land .
The reward of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and seek to cause destruction in the land shall be that they shall be killed or crucified , or their hands and feet shall be cut off alternately , or that they shall be driven out of the land .
This will be a disgrace for them in this world , and in the Hereafter they will have a grievous chastisement .
Except those who repent before you have them in your power . So know that Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
O you who believe ! Fear Allah and seek to draw near to Him and fight in His way that you may prosper .
Lo ! the Unbelievers would have all that is on earth , and then again so much that thereby they would ransom themselves from the chastisement on the Day of Resurrection , but it would not be accepted of them ; and they will have a grievous chastisement .
They want to escape the fire , but they will not escape from it , and their punishment will be everlasting .
You cut off the hands of the thief and the thief in retribution for what they have done and as a deterrent punishment from Allah . And Allah is Exalted in Might , Wise .
But whoever repents of his wrongdoing and makes amends , Allah will accept repentance from him . Indeed , Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
Have you not known that it is Allah to Whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth ?
He punishes whom He pleases , and forgives whom He pleases , and Allah has power over all things .
O Messenger ! let not those grieve you who hasten to disbelief , who say with their mouths , &quot; We believe , &quot; but do not believe in their hearts .
And among the Jews are those who listen to every lie ; they listen to others who have not yet come to you ; they shift the words from their righteous places and say : &quot; If this ( which we approve of ) is brought to you , accept it , but if it is not brought to you , then be on your guard . &quot;
And whomsoever Allah tempts , you will not be able to help him against Allah with any power .
These are those whose hearts Allah would not purify ; for them is disgrace in this world , and in the Hereafter they shall have a great chastisement .
They are notorious eavesdroppers of falsehood , devourers of the illicit .
So when they come to you , judge between them or turn away from them .
And if you turn away from them , they will not harm you at all ; but if you judge , judge between them with justice ; surely Allah loves the righteous .
And how will they appoint you as a judge when they possess the Torah , wherein is the judgment of Allah ?
Then , and in spite of all that , they turn their backs , and they are not to be called believers .
Verily We had revealed the Torah in which was guidance and light , so that the prophets who devoted themselves to Allah justified the Jews , and so did the rabbis and the scholars ; for they were commanded to keep the Book of Allah , and they were its guardians .
Therefore fear not men , but fear Me ; and give not My communications at a small price .
And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed , these are the unbelievers .
We prescribed for them therein life for life , eye for eye , nose for nose , ear for ear and tooth for tooth , and just retribution for wounds ; but whoever renounces it , it shall be an atonement to him ; and whoever does not judge by that which Allah has revealed , these are the unjust .
We made them follow Jesus , the son of Mary , to confirm that which was before him in the Torah , and We gave him the Gospel , wherein was guidance and light , confirming that which was before him in the Torah , and as guidance and admonition for those who guard ( against evil ) .
And let the people of the Gospel be guided by what Allah has revealed therein ; and those who do not follow what Allah has revealed are the unjust .
And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth , confirming that which was of the Scripture before it and providing certainty concerning it . So judge between them by what Allah has revealed , and do not follow their inclinations to deviate from the truth which has come to you .
For each of you We have established guidelines and a career .
And if Allah had pleased , He would have made you a single community .
But He wanted to test you in all that He has given you .
Therefore , compete for the good things .
To Allah will you all return , and He will inform you of that wherein you differed .
And you shall judge between them by what has been revealed from Allah , and do not follow their inclinations , and be on your guard against them lest they distress you and drive you away from a part of what Allah has revealed to you .
But if they turn away , then know that Allah intends to strike them for some of their sins . Indeed , many of mankind are unjust .
Do they want the guidelines of the Gahiliya ?
And who is a better judge than Allah for a people who are firm in their faith ?
O you who believe ! Take not the Jews and the Christians as guardians ; they are guardians of one another ; and whoever takes them from among you as guardians , he is of them ; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people .
And thou shalt see those whose hearts are afflicted with disease , and they shall hasten to them , saying : We fear lest evil befall us .
May Allah bring about victory or any other event .
Then they will repent of what they hid in their hearts .
And the believers will say : Are these the ones who swore by Allah with their most solemn oaths that they would stand firm with you ?
Their works are vanity , and they have become losers .
O you who believe , whoever turns away from your religion , know that Allah will soon bring another people whom He loves and loves , humble to the believers and harsh to the unbelievers ; they will fight in the way of Allah and will not fear the reproach of the blameless .
This is the Grace of Allah ; He grants it to whom He pleases ; and Allah is All @-@ Encompassing , All @-@ Knowing .
Indeed , your protectors are Allah and His Messenger and the believers who establish prayer , pay the zakah and bow down ( to Allah ) .
And whoever takes for guardians Allah and His Messenger and the believers , let him know that it is the party of Allah which will be victorious .
O you who believe ! do not take those for guardians from those who were given the Book before you and from the unbelievers who mock and joke with your faith , and fear Allah if you are believers .
And when you call to prayer , they mock and joke with it . This is because they are a people who do not understand .
Say : O People of the Book ! You are angry with us only because we believe in Allah and that which was revealed to us and that which was revealed before , and because most of you are unjust .
Say : Shall I teach you about those whose reward with Allah is worse than that ?
They are those whom Allah has cursed and made angry , and of whom He has made monkeys and swine and polytheists .
They are in an even worse situation and have strayed even further from the right path . &quot;
And when they come to you , they say : We believe , but they enter with disbelief and depart therein ; and Allah knows best what they conceal .
And you see how many of them compete in sin and transgression and in eating forbidden things .
Evil indeed is what they have done .
Why do the rabbis and the scribes not forbid them to speak sinfully and to eat forbidden things ?
Evil indeed is what they have done .
And the Jews say : The hand of Allah is bound .
Let their hands be bound , and let them be cursed for what they say .
No , His hands are wide open ; He bestows as He pleases .
And what has been revealed to you from your Lord will certainly strengthen many of them in their strife and disbelief .
And We have sown among them hatred and strife until the Day of Resurrection .
Whenever they kindled a fire for war , Allah quenched it , and they sought but mischief in the earth ; and Allah loveth not the doers of mischief .
If the People of the Scripture had believed and feared Allah , We would certainly have removed their iniquities from them and We would certainly have brought them into the Gardens of Bliss .
And if they had obeyed the Torah and the Gospel and what was revealed to them from their Lord , they would certainly find sustenance above themselves and at their feet . There are among them those who exercise moderation , but many of them do evil deeds .
O Messenger ! Proclaim what has been revealed to you from your Lord , and if you do not , you have not proclaimed His message .
And Allah will protect you from men ; surely Allah does not guide the disbelievers .
Say : O People of the Book ! You do not base yourselves on anything until you put into practice the Torah and the Gospel and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord .
But surely what has been revealed to you from your Lord will strengthen many of them in their strife and disbelief , so do not grieve over the disbelievers .
Those who believe , and the Jews and the Sabaeans and the Christians , whoever believes in Allah and does good deeds , there shall be no fear on them , nor shall they grieve .
Verily We had made a covenant with the Children of Israel and sent to them apostles , but whenever apostles came to them with what their hearts did not desire , some of them they declared liars and some they killed .
And they thought that this would cause no confusion ; so they became blind and deaf .
Then Allah turned to them graciously , yet many of them became blind and deaf again , and Allah sees what they do .
Lo ! those who say : Allah is the Messiah , the son of Mary , while the Messiah himself said : O Children of Israel ! Pray to Allah , my Lord and your Lord .
Whoever associates with Allah , Allah has forbidden him Paradise , and the Fire shall be his lodging , and the unjust shall not find any helpers .
Lo ! disbelievers are those who say : Allah is the third of three ; and there is no god but one god .
And if they do not refrain from what they say , surely those of them who disbelieve will have a painful chastisement .
Will they not turn to Allah in repentance and ask forgiveness of Him ?
And Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
The Messiah , the son of Mary , was but a messenger ; surely other messengers have gone before him .
And his mother was a true one ; they both used to eat food .
Lo ! how We explain the communications for them , and lo ! how they turn away .
Say : Will ye worship besides Allah that which has no power to hurt you or to profit you ?
And Allah is the Hearer , the Knower .
Say : O People of the Scripture ! Do not exaggerate unjustly in your faith and do not follow the evil desires of a people who erred before and led many astray and strayed far from the right path .
Cursed were those unbelievers among the children of Israel by the tongue of David and Jesus the son of Mary , because they disobeyed and transgressed ( against the commandments ) .
They did not hinder each other from the iniquities that they did . Evil indeed was that which they used to do .
You see how many of them take the disbelievers as protectors .
Lo ! evil is that which they have sent before for themselves , so that Allah is angry with them , and in the chastisement they shall abide forever .
And if they had believed in Allah and the Prophet and that which was revealed to him , they would not have taken them as protectors , but many of them are unjust .
Indeed , you will find that among all men the Jews and the polytheists are the most bitter enemies of the believers , and you will certainly find that those who say , &quot; We are Christians &quot; are the friendliest to the believers , because there are priests and monks among them , and because they are not haughty .
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger , you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth which they have known ; they say : Our Lord ! We believe , so write to us among those who bear witness .
And why should we not believe in Allah and in the Truth which has come to us , when we earnestly desire that our Lord should make us of the righteous ?
And because of what they have said , Allah will reward them with gardens beneath which rivers flow .
They shall abide therein forever , and that is the reward of those who do good .
But those who disbelieve and reject Our communications - these are the companions of the Gahim .
O you who believe ! do not declare forbidden the good things which Allah has made lawful for you , but do not transgress .
For Allah loveth not the transgressors .
And eat of what Allah has given you , lawful and good , and fear Allah in Whom you believe .
Allah will not call you to account for a careless word in your oaths , but He will call you to account for that which you swore wisely , and the atonement for it shall be the feeding of ten poor people as you feed your own on average , or their clothing , or the deliverance of a slave .
But if he cannot , let him fast three days .
This is the atonement for your oaths , when you have made them .
And guard your oaths .
Thus Allah makes His communications clear to you that you may be grateful .
O you who believe ! Intoxication , gambling , sacrificial stones and arrows are an abomination , the work of Satan .
So shun them , that you may be successful
Satan only wants to provoke hostility and hatred between you by the intoxication and the play , in order to keep you from remembering Allah and from prayer .
Will you be deterred ?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger and be on guard .
But if you turn away from it , then know that Our Messenger is only responsible for the clear proclamation .
Those who believe and do righteous deeds shall not be counted as sin what they eat if they fear Allah and believe and do righteous deeds , and fear and believe again , then fear again and do good ; and Allah loves those who do good .
O ye who believe ! Allah will certainly subject you to trials with the game that your hands and your spears can reach , that Allah may distinguish those who fear Him secretly .
Whoever transgresses thereafter shall have a grievous punishment .
O you who believe ! Do not kill wild animals while you go on pilgrimage .
And if any one of you kills an animal intentionally , the compensation is equal to what he killed from the cattle , according to the decree of two righteous men among you , and this shall be brought as a sacrifice to the Kawabah ; or atonement shall be feeding the poor or fasting accordingly , that he may taste the evil consequences of his deed .
Allah forgives the past , but whoever does it again , Allah will subject him to retribution .
And Allah is Mighty and Lord of Retribution .
The catch from the sea and its enjoyment are lawful for you as provision for you and for the travellers , but the game of the land is forbidden as long as you go on pilgrimage .
And fear Allah , to Whom you are gathered .
Allah has made the Kaba , the sacred house , a place of worship for mankind , and the sacred month and the sacrificial animals and the animals with the ornaments . This is so that you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth , and that Allah knows all things .
Know that Allah is severe in punishment , and that Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
The only duty of the Messenger is to preach ; and Allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal .
Say , &quot; The bad and the good are not alike , &quot; though the multitude of the bad may astonish you .
Therefore fear Allah , you wise ones , that you may prosper .
O you who believe ! Do not ask about things which , if they were revealed to you , would be unpleasant to you , and if you ask about them at the time when the Quran is revealed , they will become clear to you .
Allah hath delivered you from it , and Allah is Forgiving , Forbearing .
People have asked for it before you , but then they refused to believe it .
Allah has not commanded any &quot; Bahira &quot; or &quot; Saiba &quot; or &quot; Wasila &quot; or &quot; Ham &quot; ; but the disbelievers invent a lie against Allah , and most of them do not understand .
And when it is said to them : Come to that which has been revealed from Allah and come to the Messenger , they say : That is sufficient for us when we found our fathers ; and even if their fathers had no knowledge and were not on the right path .
O you who believe ! Watch over yourselves .
Whoever goes astray cannot harm you , if only you are on the right path yourself .
To Allah is the return of all of you ; then He will reveal to you what you used to do .
O you who believe ! When death approaches one of you , the testimony is with you at the time of the opening of the testament : two righteous men among you , or two others who are not of you , when you are travelling through the land and the calamity of death befalls you .
Ye shall withhold them both after prayer , and if ye doubt , let them both swear by Allah : We shall not gain therewith , though it be a near relative , and we shall not conceal the testimony of Allah ; surely we would otherwise be sinners .
But when it becomes known that the two are guilty of sin , let two of those against whom the two testified take their place , and let the two swear by Allah : Surely our testimony is truer than the testimony of the two ; surely we were of the unjust .
It is more likely that they will bear true witness , or that they will fear that other oaths may be required after their oath .
And fear Allah and listen ; surely Allah does not guide the disobedient people .
On the Day when Allah gathers the messengers and says : What answer do you receive ? They say : We have no knowledge . You alone are the Knower of the unseen .
When Allah shall say : &quot; O Jesus , son of Mary , remember My mercy upon thee and upon thy mother ; how I strengthened thee with the holy inspiration thou didst speak to men both in the cradle and in manhood ; and how I taught thee the Scripture and wisdom , and the Torah and the Gospel ; and how thou didst make with My permission of clay what looked like birds , thou breathed into it , and with My permission it became birds ; and how thou didst heal the blind and the lepers ; and how thou didst raise the dead with My permission ; and how I withheld the children of Israel from thee when thou didst come unto them with clear signs , and the unbelievers among them said : This is nothing but manifest magic . &quot;
And when I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and in My Messenger , they said : We believe , and bear witness that we are submissive .
When the disciples said : &quot; O Jesus son of Mary , is your Lord able to send us a table from heaven ? &quot; He said : &quot; Fear Allah if you are believers . &quot;
They said : &quot; Let us eat of it , and let our hearts be at peace , and let us know that thou hast spoken to us in truth , and let us bear witness to it ourselves . &quot;
Then said Jesus , the son of Mary : O Allah , our Lord , send us down a table from heaven , that it may be a feast for us , for the first of us and for the last of us , and a sign from Thee , and provide for us ; for Thou art the best Sustainer .
Allah said : Lo ! I will send it down to you , but whoever of you disbelieves thereafter , I will punish him with a punishment with which I will not punish any other in the world .
And when Allah shall say : O Jesus , son of Mary , hast thou said to men : Take me and my mother as two gods with Allah ? He shall say : Glory be to Thou .
I could never say what I had no right to do .
If I had said it , I &apos;m sure you would have known .
You know what is in my soul , but I do not know what you have in you .
You alone are the Knower of the unseen .
All I said to them was what You had told me , &quot; Worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord . &quot;
And I was their witness while I was with them , but after You had called me , You were their watchman , and You are the witness of all things .
If You punish them , they are Your servants , and if You forgive them , You are the Mighty , the Wise . &quot;
Allah will say : This is the day on which the truthful shall profit from their truth .
There are gardens for them , through which rivers flow , in which they shall abide for ever and ever .
Allah is pleased with them , and they are pleased with Him ; that is the great blessing . &quot;
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them , and He has power over all things .
All praise is due to Allah , Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light ; but those who disbelieve equate others with their Lord .
It is He Who created you from clay , and then He appointed a term , and another term is known to Him .
But you are still doubting !
And He is Allah , in the heavens and in the earth .
He knows what you conceal and what you say , and He knows what you do .
Nor does a sign come to them from the communications of their Lord but they turn away from it .
Thus they denied the truth when it came to them ; but soon they shall be informed of what they mocked .
Do they not see how many a generation We destroyed before them ? To them We gave power in the earth as We did not give it to you , and We sent to them from the sky abundant rain , and We made rivers to flow beneath them , then We destroyed them for their sins , and raised up after them another generation .
Even if We had revealed to you a Scripture on a piece of paper which they had touched with their hands , the disbelievers would have said : This is nothing but manifest magic .
And they say : &quot; If an angel had been sent down to him ! &quot;
But if We had sent down an angel , the matter would have been decided ; then they would not have been delayed .
And if We had made him an angel , We would have made him appear as a people , and We would have confused for them that which confuses them .
Even before you , messengers were derided , but that which they scoffed at seized the scoffers among them .
Say : Go through the land and see what was the end of the disbelievers .
Say : To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth ?
Say : Allah .
He has prescribed compassion to Himself .
He will certainly gather you together until the Day of Resurrection . Of that there is no doubt .
But those who have lost themselves do not believe it .
To Him belongs that which rests at night and during the day .
And He is the Hearing , the Knowing .
Say : Shall I take for a guardian any other than Allah , the Creator of the heavens and the earth , Who giveth sustenance and taketh no sustenance ?
Say : I was commanded that I should be the first to surrender , and be not of the polytheists .
Say : I fear the chastisement of a mighty day if I disobey my Lord .
Whoever is saved from it on that Day , He has shown mercy to him . That is a manifest success .
And if Allah harm you , no one but He can take it away ; and if He bestows good upon you , He has power to do whatever He pleases .
He is the One Who exercises power over His servants , and He is the Wise , the Wise .
Say : &quot; What testimony weighs heavier ? &quot;
Say : Allah is my witness and your witness , and this Quran has been revealed to me , that I may warn you thereby and whoever it reaches .
Did you really bear witness that there were gods besides Allah ? &quot;
Say : &quot; I don &apos;t testify . &quot;
Say : He is the only God , and most surely I am far from what you worship .
They to whom we have given the Scripture know it as they know their sons , but those who have lost themselves do not believe it .
And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or denies His verses ?
Lo ! the unjust do not attain success .
And on the day when We shall gather them all together , We shall say to those who worship idols : Where then are your gods which you believed ?
Then they will have no excuse but to say : By Allah our Lord , we were not polytheists .
Look at how they lie to themselves and let down what they thought they were doing .
And among them are those who listen to you , but We have placed covers on their hearts and deafness in their ears lest they should understand .
Even if they saw every sign , they would not believe in it , so that if they came to you they would argue with you ; and the disbelievers say : These are but fables of the former .
And they prevent themselves from doing so and keep themselves away from it .
But they plunge themselves into ruin ; but they do not understand .
And if you could only see them being set before the fire , they would say : Oh , if only we were brought back !
We would not then deny the revelations of our Lord , and we would be of the believers . &quot;
No , what they used to conceal has now become clear to them .
But if they were brought back , they would most certainly return to what they were forbidden , and most surely they are liars .
And they say : &quot; There is no other than our earthly life , and we shall not be resurrected . &quot;
But if only you could see them being brought before their Lord ! He will say : &quot; Is this not the truth ? &quot;
They will answer : &quot; Yes , by our Lord . &quot;
He will say : &quot; Then the penalty will be because you disbelieved . &quot;
Lo ! the losers are those who deny the encounter with Allah .
But when the hour shall come upon them suddenly , they shall say : Woe unto us that we have neglected them ! And they shall bear their burden upon their backs .
Life in this world is truly nothing but play and pleasure .
And most surely the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who guard ( against evil ) .
Do you not understand ( that ) ?
We know that what they say grieves you ; surely they do not accuse you of lying , but it is the communications of Allah which the unjust reject .
Indeed , messengers before you were denounced as lying , but although they were denied and persecuted , they remained patient until Our help came to them .
There is no one who can change the words of Allah . Indeed , the news has come to you of the messengers .
And if their aversion is grievous to thee , well , if thou canst find a shaft in the earth or a ladder in the sky to bring them a sign ( let it be done ) , if it were the will of Allah , He would certainly have brought them together on the right path .
So do not be one of the ignorant .
Only those who listen can record ( something ) .
But as for those who are dead , Allah will raise them up , then they shall be brought back to Him .
They say : &quot; If only a sign had been sent down to him from his Lord ! &quot;
Say : Allah has power to send down a sign , but most of them do not know .
There is not a beast on earth , nor a bird that flies on its two wings , that would not be communities like you .
We have omitted nothing in the Book .
Then they shall be gathered before their Lord .
But those who disbelieve in Our communications are deaf and dumb in darkness .
Allah guides whom He wills astray , and whom He wills He guides on a straight path .
Say : What do you think ? When the chastisement of Allah comes upon you or the hour overtakes you , will you call upon anyone other than Allah , if you are truthful ?
No , to Him alone will you call ; then He will remove that which you call upon if He wills , and you will forget that which you associate ( with Him ) .
We sent ( Messengers ) to the nations before you , then We visited them with distress and distress , that they might invoke ( Me ) .
Why then did they not humble themselves when Our punishment came upon them ?
But their hearts were hardened , and Satan made all that they did seem good to them .
When they forgot what they had been reminded of , We opened to them the gates of all things , and when they finally rejoiced in what they had received , We suddenly imposed a punishment on them , and lo ! they were plunged into despair !
So the people who were unjust were cut off , and all praise is due to Allah , Lord of the worlds .
Say : What do you think ? If Allah had removed your hearing and your face and sealed your hearts , what god but Allah could restore this to you ?
See how We recite the verses in many ways , and yet they turn away ( from it ) .
Say : What do you think ? If the punishment of Allah comes upon you suddenly or manifestly , who but the unjust will be destroyed ?
We send the messengers only as bearers of good news and as warners .
So on those who believe and correct , there shall be no fear , nor shall they grieve .
But those who disbelieve in Our communications will be seized by the chastisement because they are disobedient .
Say : I do not say to you that I have the treasures of Allah with me , nor do I know what is hidden ; nor do I say to you that I am an angel ; I follow only that which has been revealed to me .
Can a blind man and a seer be alike ?
Don &apos;t you want to think ? &apos;
And thereby warn those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord when they will have no protector nor intercessor besides Him , that they may guard ( against evil ) .
And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and in the evening , seeking His face .
You are not responsible for them , and they are not responsible for you .
If you drive them away , you become one of the unjust .
And thus have We tried some of them by others , so that they may say : Is it these to whom Allah has bestowed grace from among us ?
Does Allah not know best those who are grateful ?
And when those who believe in Our communications come to you , say : Peace be upon you .
Your Lord has ordained Mercy for Himself ; if any of you does evil unwittingly and then repents and amends , He is Forgiving , Merciful . &quot;
Thus do We make clear the signs that the way of sinners may be known .
Say : I am forbidden to worship those whom you invoke besides Allah .
Say : I do not follow your evil desires , lest I should go astray , and I should not be among the rightly guided .
Say : I follow clear evidence from my Lord which you deny .
It is not in my power ( to bring about ) what you wish to hasten .
The decision rests only with Allah .
He sets forth the truth , and He is the best judge . &quot;
Say : If that were within my power which you desire to hasten , surely the matter would be decided between me and you . And Allah knows best those who are unjust .
With Him are the keys to the unseen ; only He knows them .
And He knows what is in the land and what is in the sea .
And not a leaf falls down but He knows it , and there is not a grain in the darkness of the earth , nor any wet or dry thing but is recorded in a clear Book .
And He it is Who calls your souls by night and knows what you commit on the day when He will raise you up again , that the appointed term may be accomplished .
Then to Him you will return , and He will tell you what you have done .
And He it is Who has all power over His servants , and He sends guardians over you until , at last , when death approaches one of you , Our messengers take away his soul , and they neglect nothing .
Then they will be returned to Allah their Lord .
Verily His is the judgment , and He is the quickest in arithmetic .
Say : Who will deliver you from the dangers of the land and the sea if you call upon Him humbly and secretly say : If He delivers us from this , we shall surely be grateful .
Say : Allah delivers you from it and from all affliction , yet you associate Him with gods .
Say : He has power to send to you judgment from on high or from under your feet , or to gather you together as a group and to make some of the others taste violence .
See how We explain the signs in many ways , that they may understand .
And your people thought it was a lie , even though it is the truth .
Say : I am not your guardian .
For each prophecy a time is set , and soon you will know .
If you see those who speak foolishly about Our communications , then turn away from them until they turn to another conversation .
And if Satan make you forget ( this ) , do not sit down with the unjust after remembrance .
The righteous are not responsible for those , but only exhortation that they may become righteous .
And leave those who play with their faith and regard it as a distraction , and who are deluded by the life of the world .
And exhort them thereby lest any soul should be condemned for what they have done .
It shall have no helper nor intercessor besides Allah ; though it offers any ransom , it shall not be accepted from it .
These are the ones who are left to ruin for their own deeds .
A drink of boiling water will be their portion and a painful punishment because they disbelieved .
Say : &quot; Shall we invoke besides Allah that which does us no good or harm ? Shall we turn back on our heels after Allah has shown us the way , like a bewildered Shaitan wandering about the land ? ( But ) he has companions who call him to the right way : Come to us . &quot;
Say : The guidance of Allah is the guidance , and we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds .
And ( We have been commanded ) : &quot; Keep up prayer and fear Him , and He it is to Whom you are gathered . &quot;
It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in truth ; and the day when He says : Be , it will be so .
His Word is truth , and His is the kingdom on the day when Sura is thrust into it .
Knower of the unseen and the manifest , He is the Wise Who is best informed .
And when Abraham said to Azar his father , &quot; Do you take idols for gods ?
I see you and your people in a manifest error &quot;
then We showed Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth , that he might be of the firm ones in faith .
So when the night overshadowed him , he saw a star , and he said : This is my Lord .
But as he sank , he said , &quot; I don &apos;t love those who perish . &quot;
When he saw the moon spreading its light , he said , &quot; This is my Lord . &quot;
But when he went down , he said : Unless my Lord guides me , I shall surely be among those who go astray .
When he saw the sun spreading its light , he said , &quot; This is my Lord , this is even greater . &quot;
O my people ! I have nothing to do with that which ye associate ( with Allah ) .
Lo ! I have turned my face in uprightness to Him Who created the heavens and the earth , and I am not of the polytheists .
And his people quarrelled with him , so he said : Do you quarrel with me about Allah when He has already guided me ?
And I fear not that which ye associate with Him but that which my Lord wills . My Lord embraces all things with knowledge .
Will you not then be admonished ?
And how shall I fear that which ye associate with Allah if ye fear not to associate with Allah something for which He hath not sent you authority ? &quot;
So which of the two parties is more entitled to security if you knew ?
Those who believe and do not confuse their faith with injustice , it is they who are secure and guided .
This is Our evidence which We gave Abraham to his people .
We exalt in rank whom We will .
Lo ! thy Lord is Wise , Knowing .
And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob ; We guided each of them rightly as We guided Noah before , and of his descendants David , Solomon , Job , Joseph , Moses and Aaron .
Thus do We reward those who do good .
And ( We guided ) Zacharias and John and Jesus and Elijah ; they were all of the righteous .
And ( We guided ) Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot , and We distinguished each of the peoples .
And some of their fathers , and of their seed , and of their brethren : We chose them and guided them on the right path .
That is the guidance of Allah ; so He guides whom He pleases of His servants .
But if they had worshipped something else , surely all their deeds would have been fruitless for them .
These are they to whom We gave the Book and wisdom and prophethood .
But if these deny it , We entrust it to a people who do not deny it .
These are they whom Allah has guided , so follow their guidance .
Say : I do not ask of you any reward for it .
It is nothing but an admonition to the worlds . &quot;
They have not judged Allah correctly according to His value when they say : Allah has not revealed anything to any man .
Say : Who sent down the Scripture which Musa brought as a light and guidance to men , though ye make it a leaf of papyrus which ye make manifest while ye hide much , and where ye have been taught that which neither ye nor your fathers knew ?
Say : Allah ! Then let them continue to enjoy their vain chatter .
And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing confirming what was before it , that you may warn the mother of the cities and those around them .
Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it , and they keep their prayers regularly .
Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah , or says : &quot; It has been revealed to me , &quot; when nothing has been revealed to him , and he says : &quot; I will send down that which Allah has revealed . &quot;
But could you only see the wicked in the depths of death when the angels stretch out their hands : &quot; Deliver your souls ! Today your reward shall be the chastisement of disgrace in retribution for what you have said falsely against Allah , and because you have turned away haughtily from His communications . &quot;
And now you come to Us one by one , as We first created you , and leave behind you what We gave you , and We do not see with you your intercessors whom you thought to be partners in your affairs .
Now you are cut off from one another , and that which you thought is gone from you .
Lo ! Allah it is Who causes the grain and the kernels to germinate ; He brings forth the living from the dead , and He is the giver of the dead from the living .
That is Allah ; why then are you turned away ?
He causes the day to break forth , and He makes the night rest , and the sun and the moon a reckoning ( of day and night ) . This is the ordinance of the Almighty , the Knowing .
And He it is Who created the stars for you , that through them you may find the way in the darkness of the land and the sea .
And thus have We set forth in detail the communications for the people who have knowledge .
It is He Who brought you forth from a single soul , then a dwelling for you ( in the womb ) and a resting @-@ place ( in the grave ) . We have set forth the Signs for a people who understand .
And He it is Who sends down water from the sky ; with it do We bring forth all kinds of plants ; with them do We bring forth green things , from which We cause grain to sprout in rows ; and from the date palm , from its umbels , date clusters , and gardens of berries , and olives and pomegranates , similar and not alike .
Consider their fruit when they bear fruit , and their ripening .
Verily in this are signs for a people who believe .
And yet they have made the jinn partners with Allah , though He created them , and they falsely ascribe sons and daughters to Him without any knowledge .
Glory be to Him and exalted above what they ascribe ( to Him ) .
Creator of the heavens and the earth ! How could He have a son when He has no companion and when He created all things and knows all things ?
He is Allah , your Lord . There is no god but He , the Creator of all things , so worship Him .
And He is the Guardian of all things .
Looks cannot reach Him , but He reaches the Looks ; and He is the All @-@ Beneficent , the All @-@ Knowing .
Verily , visible proofs have now come to you from your Lord ; so if one sees , it is for his own good ; and if one becomes blind , it is to his own detriment .
And I am not your watchman .
Thus do We set forth the verses that they may say : Thou hast searched , and that We may make them clear to the people who have knowledge .
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord - there is no god but Him and turn away from polytheists .
And if Allah had willed , they would not have associate ( with Him ) any gods .
We have not made you their guardian , nor are you their guardian .
And do not revile those whom they invoke besides Allah , otherwise they would revile Allah out of resentment without knowledge .
Thus do We make pleasing to every people what they do .
Then they will return to their Lord , and He will tell them what they have done .
And they have sworn by Allah , most surely , that if there came to them but a sign , they would believe in it .
Say : Allah disposes of the signs .
And what gives you the certainty that they will believe when they come ? &quot;
And We will confuse their hearts and their eyes , because they did not believe in it the first time , and We will cause them to err blindly in their rebellion .
And when We sent down angels to them and said to them the dead , and We gathered all things to them , they would not believe except that Allah would , but most of them are ignorant .
And thus We had designated for every Prophet enemies , the Satans of men and jinn .
They utter deceptive speech to one another , and if your Lord had willed it , they would not have done it , so leave them to themselves with what they forge .
And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it and take pleasure in it , and may earn what they earn .
Shall I then seek a Judge other than Allah , and He it is Who has made clear to you the Book and revealed it to you ?
And those to whom We have given the Book know that it was revealed from your Lord with the truth , so you should not be of the contenders .
And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and righteousness .
No one can change His Words , and He is the Hearer , the Knower .
And if you obey most of those in the earth , they will lead you astray from the way of Allah . They follow only guesses and they only guess .
Lo ! thy Lord knoweth best those who stray from His way , and He knoweth best those who are guided .
So eat that on which the name of Allah has been pronounced , if you believe in His Signs .
Why should you not eat of that whereof the name of Allah has been pronounced , when He has already explained to you what He has forbidden you except what you are compelled to do ?
And indeed , many lead astray with their lusts through lack of knowledge .
Lo ! thy Lord knoweth the transgressors best .
And shun the manifest and the secret sin .
Those who acquire sin will receive the reward for their acquisition .
And eat not of that on which the name of Allah has not been pronounced ; surely that is iniquity .
And most surely the Shaitans will inspire their friends to quarrel with you , and if you obey them , you will be polytheists .
Can he who was dead and to whom We gave life , and for whom We made a light to walk thereby among men , be like him who is in darkness and is not able to come forth therefrom ?
And so what they used to do was made beautiful to the unbelievers .
And thus have We done in every town with the leaders of their sinners , that they may plot therein , and they only plot against their own souls without their knowledge .
And when a Sign comes to them , they say : We will not believe until we receive what the messengers of Allah have received .
Allah knows best to whom He entrusts His message .
Lo ! humiliation before Allah and a severe punishment will befall the sinners for their schemes .
But whomsoever Allah wills to guide , He enlarges his chest for Islam , and whomsoever He wills to lead astray , He makes his chest narrow and heavy as if he ascends to heaven .
Thus does Allah punish those who disbelieve .
And this is the way of your Lord , a straight path . We have set forth the communications for the people who are admonished .
They will have a home of peace with their Lord , and He is their guardian for their deeds .
And on the day when He gathers them all together , then ( He says ) : O jinn ! you have made for yourselves many people .
And their friends among men say : &quot; Our Lord ! some of us have benefited from others , but now we are at the end of the term which You have appointed for us . &quot;
He says : The fire shall be your lodging @-@ place , therein you shall abide forever , unless Allah wills otherwise .
Lo ! thy Lord is Wise , Knowing .
And thus do We set some of the unjust above others for what they earned .
&quot; O jinn and men ! Have not there come to you messengers from among you who recounted My communications to you and warned you of the coming of this day of yours ? &quot;
They say , &quot; We are testifying against ourselves . &quot;
The earthly life has deceived them , and they will bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers .
This is because your Lord did not unjustly want to destroy the cities while their inhabitants were unwarned .
Everyone has ranks for what he has done , and your Lord does not overlook what they do .
And your Lord is He Who does not depend on anyone , and to Whom belongs mercy .
If He wills , He will remove you and cause you to be succeeded by what pleases Him , just as He raised you from the offspring of others .
Verily what you are promised , it shall come to pass , and you cannot frustrate it .
Say : O people ! act according to your point of view , and I will act .
Soon you will know who will receive the final reward of the abode . &quot;
Behold , the unjust are never successful .
And they have given to Allah a portion of the crops of the field and of the cattle which He raised , and they say : &quot; This is for Allah , &quot; as they think , &quot; and this is for our partners . &quot; But what is for their partners , Allah does not attain , and what is for Allah attains to their partners .
Evil is what they judge .
And likewise have their associates made the killing of their children pleasing to many of the idolaters , that they might destroy them and confuse their faith .
Had Allah imposed His will , they would not have done it , so leave them to themselves with what they forge .
And they said : This cattle and this crops are untouchable ; let no one eat thereof except whomsoever we permit , as they thought , and there are cattle whose backs are forbidden , and cattle over which they do not utter the name of Allah and thus invent a lie against Allah .
Soon He will repay them for what they forged .
And they say : &quot; Whatever is in the womb of these animals is reserved exclusively for our husbands and forbidden to our wives . &quot; But if it is dead , they have a share in it .
He will give them the reward for their assertion .
Lo ! He is Wise , Knowing .
Lo ! those who kill their children out of foolish ignorance and forbid that which Allah hath given them , invent a lie against Allah .
Indeed , they have gone astray , and they are not guided .
And He it is Who causes gardens to grow , with and without stakes , and the date palm and the fields of grain , the fruits of which are of various kinds , and olives and pomegranates ( trees ) , alike and dissimilar .
Eat of its fruits when they bear fruit , and on the day of harvest give of it its portion , but be not extravagant ; surely He does not love those who do not exert moderation .
Among the livestock are animals of burden and animals for slaughter .
Eat of that which Allah hath given you , and follow not the footsteps of Satan : surely he is an open enemy to you .
Eight pairs : two of the sheep and two of the goats .
Say : Is it the two males whom He has forbidden , or the two females , or what the womb of the two females embraces ?
Tell me with knowledge , if you are truthful . &quot;
Say of the camels two and of the oxen two : Are they the two males whom He has forbidden , or the two females , or what the wombs of the two females enclose ?
Were you there when Allah commanded you this ? &quot;
Who then is more unjust than he who devises a lie against Allah in order to mislead people without knowledge ?
Lo ! Allah guides not the unjust people .
Say : I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to an eater who desires to eat it except that which dies of its own accord or flows out of the blood or the flesh of swine , for that is an uncleanness or an abomination wherein a name other than that of Allah has been invoked .
But if anyone is driven by necessity and does not commit disobedience or transgression , then your Lord is Forgiving , Merciful .
And to the Jews We have forbidden all animals with claws , and We have forbidden them fat from the oxen and the sheep except what is on their backs or in the intestines or in the bones .
With this We have repaid them for their rebellion , and lo ! We are Truly .
But if they accuse you of falsehood , say : Your Lord is of all @-@ encompassing mercy , but His severity shall not be removed from the criminal people .
The polytheists will say : &quot; If Allah had pleased , neither we nor our fathers would have joined ( anything ) , nor would we have done anything without permission . &quot;
Likewise , those who were before them denied until they tasted Our severity .
Say : Do you have any knowledge ?
Then it comes out for us .
But you are only following conjecture ; and you are puzzling . &quot;
Say : Allah has the convincing evidence .
If He had willed , He would have guided you all . &quot;
Say : &quot; Bring your witnesses who testify that Allah has forbidden this . &quot;
If they bear witness , do not bear witness with them , and do not follow the inclinations of those who have denied Our revelations and those who do not believe in the Hereafter and equate other beings with their Lord .
Come here , and I will recite what your Lord has forbidden you : you shall not associate with Him anything and be kind to your parents , and you shall not kill your children out of poverty , for We provide for you and for them ; you shall not approach depravity , whether it be manifest or concealed ; and you shall not kill anyone whose life Allah has made sacred except when it is done according to justice .
That is what He has commanded you , that you may understand .
And do not approach the possession of the orphan except for its own good until it reaches the age of adulthood , and give full measure and weight in equity .
We do not demand of any soul anything beyond what it can accomplish .
And when you make a statement , do justice , even if it concerns a near relative , and keep the covenant of Allah .
That is what He commands you , that you may be reminded .
And this is My Straight Path . So follow it , and do not follow the ways that they may not lead you far from His Path .
That is what He commands you , that you may guard ( against evil ) .
Then We gave Moses the Book ( of Mercy ) for him who did good , and as a clarification of all things , and as guidance , and as mercy , that they may believe in the meeting with their Lord .
And this is a Book which We have revealed full of blessings , so follow it and beware of sin , that you may find mercy .
lest ye say : Only to two peoples before us was the Scripture revealed , and we had no knowledge of its contents .
Or that ye say not : Had the Book been revealed unto us , we would most certainly have been guided better than they .
Now there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord and a guidance and a mercy .
Who then is more unjust than he who disbelieves in the communications of Allah and turns away from them ?
We will inflict on those who turn away from Our communications a grievous punishment , for they have turned away .
Do they wait for angels to come to them , or for your Lord to come , or for some signs of your Lord to come ?
On the Day when certain Signs of your Lord will come , faith in them shall not avail anyone who has not believed before or done good in his faith .
Say : &quot; Just wait ; we too are waiting . &quot;
But with those who have contributed to the division of their religion and become parties , you have nothing in common .
Their matter will certainly be judged by Allah , then He will inform them of what they have done .
Whoever does a good deed shall be recompensed ten times ; but whoever does an evil deed shall receive only the same as his reward , and they shall not be wronged .
Say : Surely my Lord has guided me on a right path to the religion of truth , the religion of Abraham , the upright one , and he was not of the polytheists .
Say : My prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death belong to Allah , the Lord of the Worlds .
He has no one beside Him . And so I have been commanded , and I am the first of those who submit to God . &quot;
Say : Shall I seek a Lord other than Allah , when He is the Lord of all things ?
And no soul works except against himself , and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another .
Then you will return to your Lord , and He will instruct you concerning all that you have disagreed .
And He it is Who has made you successors on earth , elevating some of you above others by degrees , in order to test you by what He has given you .
Lo ! thy Lord is swift in punishment , and verily He is Forgiving , Merciful .
Alif Lam Mim Sad .
( This is ) a Book revealed to you ; you shall not be afflicted on account of it , and you shall warn with it , and it shall be a reminder to the believers .
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord , and follow no protector but He .
How little are you mindful of this !
And how many cities have We destroyed ! Our punishment came upon them by night or while they were resting at noon .
Their cry was nothing but when Our punishment came upon them , they said : We were indeed unjust .
Lo ! We will ask those to whom ( the messengers ) have been sent , and We will ask the messengers .
Then We will inform them with knowledge ( of what has happened ) , for We were never absent .
And the weighing on that day will be true .
Those whose scales are then heavy will succeed .
But those whose scales are light are those who have lost themselves because they transgressed against Our communications .
Lo ! We have given you power in the earth and have prepared for you therein means of subsistence ; how little are you grateful !
And We created you , then We gave you the form ; then We said to the angels : Prostrate yourselves before Adam , and they all prostrated themselves ; except Iblis , he was not of those who prostrated themselves .
He said : &quot; What prevented you from prostrating yourself after I commanded you ? &quot;
He said : &apos; I &apos;m better than him .
You created me from fire , but you created me from clay ! &quot;
He said : &quot; Down with you from here ; it is not befitting for you to be haughty here .
Go out then ; surely you are one of the humbled . &quot;
He said , &quot; Give me respite until the day they are raised . &quot;
He said : &apos; You have been given a reprieve . &apos;
He said : Because Thou hast made me go astray , I will certainly lie in wait for them on Thy straight path .
Then I will come over them from the front and from behind , from the right and from the left , and you will not find the majority of them grateful . &quot;
He said : Away with thee , despised and cast away .
Lo ! whoso of them followeth thee - I will fill hell with you all . &quot;
&quot; O Adam ! Dwell thou in the Garden with thy spouse , and eat of whatsoever ye will , except approach not this tree , lest ye be unjust . &quot;
But the Shaitan whispered evil to them in order to make known to them that which was hidden from them of their shame . He said : Your Lord has forbidden you this tree only so that you may not become angels or everlasting .
And he swore to them : &quot; Surely I am a sincere counselor to you . &quot;
So he seduced them by deception .
And when they tasted of the tree , their shame was revealed to them , and they began to clothe themselves with the leaves of the garden , and their Lord called them : Did I not forbid you this tree and say to you : Surely Satan is your manifest enemy ?
They said : Our Lord ! surely we have sinned against ourselves , and if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us , then surely we shall be of the losers .
He said : &quot; Go down with you , some of you shall be enemies of the other , and there shall be for you on earth a abode and a provision for a time . &quot;
He said : You shall live on it , and you shall die on it , and from it you shall be brought forth .
O children of Adam ! We have given you raiment to cover your shame and for adornment ; but the raiment of piety - that is the best .
This is one of the Signs of Allah , that they may be mindful .
O children of Adam ! let not Satan seduce you , as he drove your parents out of the Garden and took their garments from them to show them their shame .
Lo ! he seeth you , he and his band , from whence ye see them not .
Lo ! We have made the Shaitans friends of those who disbelieve .
And when they commit lewdness , they say : We found our fathers with it , and Allah has enjoined them on us .
Say : Lo ! Allah commands no transgressions .
Will ye then speak of Allah what ye do not know ?
Say : My Lord has commanded righteousness , and you shall turn your faces to Him in every place of worship , and you shall call upon Him in sincere obedience .
As He has brought you into existence , so you will return ( to Him ) . &quot;
He has guided a company , but to another error has been made due , because they have taken the Shaitans for guardians besides Allah , and they think they are guided .
O children of Adam ! Have a cultivated apparition in every place of prayer , and eat and drink , but do not exceed the limits ; surely He does not love those who do not exercise moderation .
Say : Who has forbidden the good things of Allah which He has brought forth for His servants and the good things of provision ?
Say : They are for the believers in this life ( and ) exclusively ( for them ) on the Day of Resurrection .
Thus do We make clear the Signs for a people who have knowledge .
Say : My Lord has not forbidden but depravity , whether manifest or concealed , and sin and unjust violence , and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not revealed any authority , and that you say of Allah that which you do not know .
Every people has an appointed term , and when their time has come , they cannot delay ( it ) for an hour , nor can they bring it forward .
O children of Adam ! when there come to you from among you messengers reciting to you My communications concerning those who guard ( against evil ) and do good deeds , there shall be no fear , nor shall they grieve .
But those who disbelieve in Our communications and turn away from them haughtily shall be the dwellers of the Fire ; therein shall they abide forever .
Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or accuses His communications of a lie ?
These shall be the appointed portion until Our messengers come to them to kill them , and they shall say : Where then is that which ye invoked besides Allah ?
They will answer , &quot; We cannot find them &quot; ; and they will bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers .
He will say : &quot; Enter the fire to the hordes of jinn and men who passed away before you . &quot;
Whenever a company enters , it is cursed by its sister company , until at last , when they have all entered it one after the other , the last will say to the first : &quot; Our Lord ! these have led us astray , so give them the punishment of the Fire more than once . &quot;
He will say : &quot; Everyone has ( them ) several times , but you do not know . &quot;
And the first will say to the last : &quot; So you had no advantage over us , so taste the penalty for what you have done . &quot;
Indeed , for those who deny Our communications and turn away from them with pride , the gates of heaven will not be opened , nor will they enter Paradise until a camel passes through the eye of a needle .
And thus do We reward the criminals .
They shall have Gahannam for the camp and for a covering over them .
And thus do We reward the unjust .
But those who believe and do righteous deeds - We do not burden any soul beyond its ability - they are the dwellers of Paradise , therein they shall abide forever .
And We will remove whatever resentment may be in their hearts .
Rivers shall flow beneath them , and they shall say : All praise is due to Allah Who has guided us to this ( Paradise ) .
We could not have found the way if Allah had not guided us .
Indeed , the messengers of our Lord have brought the truth . &quot;
And let it be said to them : This is the Paradise which will be given to you as an inheritance for what you have done .
And the inhabitants of Paradise cry out to the inhabitants of Hell : &quot; Lo ! we have found the truth of what our Lord promised us .
Have you found as truth what your Lord promised you ? &quot;
They say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Then a crier among them announces : &quot; The curse of Allah be on the wrongdoers .
who turn back from the way of Allah and seek to pervert it and do not believe in the Hereafter . &quot;
And between the two there shall be a partition , and in the heights there shall be a people who recognize the two by their marks , and they shall say to the party of Paradise : Peace be upon you ! These have not entered ( Paradise ) , though they hope for it .
And when their eyes turn to those who dwell in the Fire , they say : Our Lord ! make us not the people of the unjust .
And those in the heights cry out to the people whom they know by their marks , saying : Nothing has profited you from what you have gathered together , nor has your pride ( been profitable for you ) .
Are these the ones of whom you swore that Allah would not show them mercy ? &quot;
Enter Paradise ; let no fear come upon you , nor shall you grieve .
And the dwellers of the Fire cry out to the dwellers of Paradise : Pour on us some water or some of what Allah has given you .
They say : Surely Allah has forbidden both to the unbelievers .
who regarded their religion as a distraction and played with it and were infatuated with earthly life . &quot;
On this day We forget them how they forgot the meeting on this their day , and how they used to disbelieve in Our communications .
And most surely We had brought them a Book which We set forth with knowledge as a guidance and a mercy for the people who believe .
Are they waiting for something ( other ) than its interpretation ?
On the day when his interpretation becomes a reality , those who had forgotten before will say : &quot; Indeed , the messengers of our Lord have brought the truth .
Do we have intercessors who intercede for us ?
Or could we be sent back , that we might do other than what we used to do ? &quot;
They have ruined their souls , and what they were accustomed to inventing has let them down .
Lo ! your Lord is Allah , Who created the heavens and the earth in six days , and then turned majestically to ( His ) kingdom : He covers the night with a covering of the day that follows it in haste , and ( He created ) the sun and the moon and the stars , subservient to His command .
Verily His is the creation and the command !
Blessed is Allah , the Lord of the Worlds .
Invoke your Lord humbly and secretly .
Lo ! He loveth not the transgressors .
And do not cause mischief on earth after order has been established there , and call upon Him in fear and hope .
Lo ! the mercy of Allah is near to those who do good deeds .
It is He Who , in His mercy , sends the winds as glad tidings until , when they carry a heavy cloud , We drive them to a dead place ; then We bring down from it water with which We bring forth fruits of every kind .
Thus do We bring forth the dead , that ye may remember it .
And the good place ( its plants ) sprout by permission of its Lord , and the bad place ( its plants ) sprout but miserably .
And thus do We turn the signs to a people who are grateful .
We sent Noah to his people , and he said : O my people ! worship Allah ; you have no god but Him ; surely I fear for you the chastisement of a great day .
And the nobles of his people said : Surely we see you in manifest error .
O my people ! there is no error in me , but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds .
I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and give you sincere advice , and I know through Allah what you do not know .
Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord by a man from among you that he may warn you , and that you may fear ( Allah ) and perhaps find mercy ? &quot;
But they deny him , then We delivered him and those who were with him in the ship , and We drowned those who rejected Our communications ; surely they were a blind band .
And to the Ad ( We sent ) their brother Hud .
O my people ! worship Allah ! Ye have no god but Him .
Will ye not fear Allah ? &quot;
The disbelievers of his people said : Surely we see you in folly , and most surely we consider you a liar .
O my people ! there is no folly in me , but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds .
I deliver to you the messages of my Lord , and I am to you a sincere and faithful counsellor .
Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord by a man from among you that he may warn you ?
And remember when He made you heirs of the people of Noah and gave you an abundance of stature .
Remember then the grace of Allah , that you may prosper .
Have you come to us that we should worship Allah alone and forsake that which our fathers worshipped ?
Bring to us what you promise us , if you are truthful . &quot;
He said : Surely there is now due for you punishment and wrath from your Lord .
Will ye contend with me concerning the names which ye have named , ye and your fathers , whereunto Allah hath not revealed authority ?
Wait , I am with you among those who wait . &quot;
Then We saved him and those who were with him by Our mercy , and We cut off the last branch of those who rejected Our communications and disbelieved .
And to Tamud ( We sent ) their brother Saleh .
O my people ! worship Allah ! Ye have no god but Him .
Verily there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord - this mare of camels of Allah as a sign for you .
So let them graze on the earth of Allah and do it no harm ; otherwise you will be afflicted with a painful chastisement .
Remember when He appointed you heirs of the Ad and assigned you a place in the land ; you build palaces on its plains and dig dwellings in the mountains .
So remember the grace of Allah and do not cause mischief in the land by causing mischief .
Those of his people who were proud said to those who were oppressed - those were the believers among them : &quot; Are you certain that Saleh has been sent by his Lord ? &quot;
They said : Surely we believe in what he has been sent with .
So the haughty said : Surely we disbelieve in that in which ye believe .
Then they cut the sinews of the camel @-@ mare and defied the command of their Lord and said : O Saleh ! bring to us that which thou hadst promised us , if thou art of the messengers .
Then the tremor seized them , and in the morning they lay down on the ground in their dwellings .
So he turned away from them and said : O my people ! I delivered to you the message of my Lord and offered you sincere advice , but you do not love the counsellors .
And ( We sent ) Lot when he said to his people : Do you commit an indecency such as no one in the world has done before you ?
Indeed , you indulge in lust with men rather than with women .
No , you &apos;re a dissolute people . &apos;
The answer of his people was none other than , &quot; Cast them out of your city , for they are people who want to purify themselves . &quot;
Then We saved him and his family , except for his wife , for she was of those who remained behind .
And We rained down a great rain on them .
Now look how the end of the criminals was !
And to the Madyan ( We sent ) their brother Suaib .
O my people ! worship Allah ! Ye have no god but Him .
A clear sign has now come to you from your Lord . Therefore , give full measure and weight and do not diminish people &apos;s affairs and do not cause mischief on earth according to their order .
That is better for you if you are believers .
And do not lurk menacingly in every path , turning aside those who believe in Him from the way of Allah , and seeking to pervert it .
And remember how few you were and how He multiplied you .
And see how was the end of those who caused mischief !
And if there are among you those who believe in what I have been sent with and others who do not believe , be patient until Allah judges between us ; for He is the best Judge .
O Suaib ! surely we will drive thee out of our city , and the believers with thee , if ye do not return to our religion .
He said : &apos; Even if we &apos;re not willing ( to do that ) ?
Indeed , we would forge a lie against Allah if we returned to your religion after Allah had saved us from it . It is not for us to return to it except that Allah , our Lord , wills it . Our Lord embraces all things with knowledge ; in Allah we trust ; O our Lord ! judge between us and our people according to the truth ; for it is Thou Who decides best . &quot;
And the nobles of his people , who disbelieved , said : If you follow Suaib , you are indeed lost .
Then the tremor seized them , and in the morning they lay stretched out on the ground in their dwellings .
Those who had accused Suaib of lying were treated as if they had never lived in it . Those who had accused Suaib of lying were themselves the losers .
O my people ! surely I conveyed to you the messages of my Lord and gave you sincere advice .
How am I supposed to feel sorry for unbelieving people ? &quot;
Never did We send a Prophet to a town but We afflicted its inhabitants with distress and affliction , that they might pray ( to Me ) humbly .
Then We exchanged evil for good until they grew up and said : Our fathers also experienced sorrow and gladness .
Then We seized them suddenly without them realizing it .
But if the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah , We would certainly have opened to them the blessings of heaven and earth , but they denied , so We seized them for what they had done .
Are the people of the cities secure that Our punishment will not come upon them at night while they are still asleep ?
Or are the townspeople sure that Our punishment will not come upon them in the morning while they are at play ?
Are they safe from the plan of Allah ?
But no one can feel safe from the plan of Allah except the people of the losers .
Does this not make it clear to those who inherited the earth from its inhabitants that We can , if We will , hit them for their sins and seal their hearts so that they cannot hear ?
These are the cities whose story We have told you .
Indeed , their apostles had come to them with clear proofs , but they would not believe in that which they had denied before .
Thus Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers .
And with most of them We found no allegiance , but We found most of them to be unjust .
Then , after them , We sent Moses with Our communications to Pharaoh and his nobles , but they transgressed against them .
Now see how the end of those who caused mischief was !
O Pharaoh ! I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds .
It is fitting that I speak of Allah nothing but the truth . I have come to you with clear evidence from your Lord , so let the children of Israel go with me . &quot;
He said : &quot; If you have indeed come with a sign , show it if you are of the truthful . &quot;
Then he threw down his stick , and there it was ( all of a sudden ) a bodily serpent .
Then he pulled out his hand and it ( all of a sudden ) looked white to the audience .
The nobles of the people of Pharaoh said : Surely this is a wise sorcerer .
He wants to drive you out of your land .
So what are you doing ? &apos;
Wait a while with him and his brother , and send proclaimers to a meeting in the cities .
That they may bring to thee every wise sorcerer .
And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh and said : Surely we shall have a reward if we conquer ?
He said : &quot; Yes , and you shall be near ( to us ) . &quot;
They said : O Musa ! Either you throw ( the staff ) or we throw ( first ) .
He said , &quot; You should throw ! &quot;
And when they had cast , they bewitched the eyes of the people , terrified them , and brought forth a great magic .
And We revealed to Moses : Cast thy rod , and lo ! it swallowed up all the falsehood they had uttered .
Thus the truth was accomplished , and their works proved void .
There they were defeated at that time , and they returned ashamed .
And the sorcerers were made to bow down in adoration .
They said : We believe in the Lord of the Worlds .
the Lord of Moses and Aaron . &quot;
And Pharaoh said : Ye believed in him before I permitted you .
Lo ! this is a deceit which ye have devised in the city to drive out its inhabitants from it ; but ye shall know soon .
Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately , and I will crucify you all . &quot;
Then we will return to our Lord .
You only take revenge on us because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us .
Our Lord , give us much patience and let us die as Muslims . &quot;
The nobles of Pharaoh &apos;s people said : &quot; Will you allow Moses and his people to do evil in the land and forsake you and your gods ? &quot; He said : &quot; We will kill their sons and leave their wives alive , for we have dominion over them . &quot;
Then Moses said to his people : &quot; Intreat Allah for help and be patient .
Lo ! the earth is the inheritance of Allah from His servants to whom He pleases , and the end ( of all things ) is for the righteous . &quot;
They said : &quot; We suffered before you came to us and after you came to us . &quot;
He said : &quot; Let your Lord soon destroy your enemies and give you dominion in the land , and He will see what you do . &quot;
And We punished Pharaoh &apos;s people with drought and lack of fruit , that they might be reminded .
But when good came to them , they said : That is due to us . And when evil struck them , they attributed the evil to Musa and his people .
Surely their calamity is with Allah alone , but most of them do not know .
And they said : &quot; Whatever sign you bring us to charm us with , we will not believe you . &quot;
So We sent upon them the flood and the locusts and the lice and the frogs and the blood , clear signs , but they were arrogant and became a sinful people .
O Musa ! pray to your Lord for us and appeal to what He has promised you .
If you take away the punishment from us , we will most certainly believe you , and we will most certainly let the children of Israel go with you . &quot;
But when We took away from them the chastisement for a term which they should complete , lo ! they broke their word .
Then We punished them and drowned them in the sea , because they denied Our communications and disregarded them .
And We gave to the people who were weak the eastern parts of the land as their inheritance and the western parts which We had blessed .
And the merciful word of thy Lord was fulfilled thereby upon the children of Israel , because they were patient , and We destroyed all that Pharaoh and his people had created and that they had built of tall buildings .
And We brought the Children of Israel through the sea , and they came to a people devoted to their idols , and they said : O Musa ! make us a god like these gods .
He said : &apos; You are an unteachable people .
Most surely all that they do will perish , and all that they do will be vanity . &quot;
He said : &quot; Shall I ask for you a god other than Allah , though He has distinguished you above all nations ? &quot;
And remember the time when We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh who afflicted you with bitter torment and killed your sons and left your wives alive .
And therein lay a grievous trial for you from your Lord .
And We made an appointment with Musa for thirty nights and supplemented it with ten , so the appointed time of his Lord was completed - forty nights .
And Moses said to his brother Aaron : Represent me with my people and lead ( them ) rightly and do not follow the way of those who do evil .
And when Musa had come to Our appointment , and his Lord had spoken to him , he said : My Lord ! show me that I may see thee .
He said : Thou shalt not see Me , but look upon the mountain ; if it remains in its place unmoved , thou shalt see Me .
So when his Lord appeared to the mountain , He reduced it to rubble , and Moses fell down unconscious .
And when he came to himself , he said : &quot; Glory be to You , I am converted to You , and I am the first of the believers . &quot;
He said : O Musa ! I have chosen you above the people by My message and by My Word to you , so accept what I have given you and be of the grateful .
And We wrote down for him on the tablets all kinds of admonition and explanation of all things : So hold fast to them and command your people to observe the best of them .
Soon I will show you the place of the wicked .
But I will turn away from My signs those who behave haughtily in the land against all justice ; and even if they see all the signs , they will not believe in it ; and if they see the way of righteousness , they will not accept it as the way ; but if they see the way of error , they accept it as the way .
This is because they denied Our communications and disregarded them .
Those who disbelieve in Our Signs and their meeting in the Hereafter - their works are invalid .
Can they be rewarded for anything other than what they have done ?
And the people of Moses , after he had departed , took from their jewellery a bodily calf that wracked .
Did they not see that it could not speak to them and guide them to the right path ?
They took it , and they became impious .
Then when they were overcome with repentance and saw that they had indeed gone astray , they said : Unless our Lord has mercy on us and forgives us , we shall most certainly be among the losers .
And when Moses returned to his people , angry and grieved , he said : &quot; What you have done in my absence in my place is grievous .
Would ye hasten the command of your Lord ? &quot;
And he threw the tablets , and took his brother by the head , and dragged him to himself .
Son of my mother , behold , the people thought I was weak , and they nearly killed me .
Therefore let not the enemies rejoice over me , nor accord me to the people of the wicked . &quot;
He ( Moses ) said : My Lord ! forgive me and my brother and grant us access to Your Mercy ; surely You are the Most Merciful .
Indeed , those who took the calf for themselves will be the wrath of their Lord and disgrace in the life of this world .
And thus do We reward those who fabricate lies .
But as for those who did evil and then repented and believed , surely your Lord is Forgiving , Merciful .
And when the wrath turned away from Musa , he took the tablets , and in their record was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord .
And Moses chose from among his people seventy men for Our appointment .
My Lord , if You had willed , You could have destroyed them first , and me also .
Will You destroy us because of what the fools among us have done ?
This is only a test of yourself . With it you mislead whom you want and show the way to whom you want .
You are our protector , so forgive us and have mercy on us , for You are the best of those who forgive .
And appoint for us good things , both in this world and in the Hereafter , for to You we have returned in repentance . &quot;
He said : I punish whom I will , but My mercy encompasses all things , so I will ordain them for those who fear ( Me ) and pay the Zakah and for those who believe in Our communications .
These are they who follow the Messenger , the Prophet , who is ignorant of reading and writing ; there in the Torah and in the Gospel they will find ( written ) about him : he commands them good and forbids them evil , and he makes lawful for them good things and forbids bad things from them , and he takes away from them their burden and the fetters that were upon them - so those who believe in him and strengthen him and help him and follow the light that has been sent down with him - let them be successful .
Say : O mankind ! I am for you all a messenger of Allah , Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth .
There is no god but He . He gives life and causes death .
Therefore believe in Allah and His Messenger , the Prophet , who is ignorant of reading and writing , who believes in Allah and His Words , and follow Him that you may be guided correctly . &quot;
And among the people of Moses there is a church that in truth shows the way and then does righteousness .
And We divided them into twelve tribes into communities , and We revealed to Moses when his people asked him to drink something : &quot; Strike with your staff to the rock . &quot;
Then twelve springs sprang forth from it , so every tribe knew its drinking place , and We caused them to be overshadowed by clouds , and We sent down to them manna and salvah : Eat of the good things which We have provided for you .
And they did not harm Us , but they did harm themselves .
And when it is said to them : &quot; Dwell in this city and take your food from it wherever you please , and say : &quot; Forgiveness , &quot; and enter the gate prostrating yourselves , then We will forgive you your sins ; surely We will do more to those who do good . &quot;
So the unjust among them exchanged the sentence for something other than that which had been spoken to them , so We sent down upon them from heaven a punishment for their wrongdoing .
And ask them about the city that was by the sea , and how they profaned the Sabbath , how their fish came to them in droves on their Sabbath day ; but on the day when they did not keep the Sabbath , they did not come to them .
So We tested them because they had transgressed .
And when a community among them said : Why do you exhort a people whom Allah desires to destroy or punish with a severe punishment ? Then they said : As an excuse to your Lord and that they may guard ( against evil ) .
And when they forgot what they had been reminded of , We saved those who had prevented evil , and We seized the unjust with a painful chastisement because they had transgressed .
And when they persisted defiantly in what they had been forbidden , We said to them : Become despicable monkeys .
And when your Lord announced that He would certainly send against them until the Day of Resurrection those who would afflict them with severe punishment ; surely your Lord is swift in chastisement ; and most surely He is Forgiving , Merciful .
And We have divided them in the earth into nations ; among them are the righteous , and among them are those who are not like that , and We have tried them with good and evil that they may turn back .
Then descendants followed them who inherited the Scripture , but they reach for the poor possessions of this low world and say , &quot; We shall be forgiven . &quot;
But if ( again ) such goods came to them , they seized them again .
Was not the Covenant of the Scripture made with them that they should speak nothing of Allah but the truth ?
And they have read what it says .
But the abode in the Hereafter is better for the righteous .
Do you not want to understand ?
And those who hold fast to the Scripture and establish prayer We do not allow the righteous to lose their reward .
And when We shook the mountain above them as if it were a shade giver , and they thought it would fall upon them : Hold fast what We have given you , and remember what is in it , that you may guard ( against evil ) .
And when thy Lord , of the sons of Adam , brought forth their offspring from their loins , and made them witnesses against Himself , ( saying ) : Am I not your Lord ? They said : Surely we bear witness .
That ye may not say on the Day of Resurrection : Lo ! we knew nothing of it .
Or ( lest you should say ) : Only our fathers were polytheists before , but we were a generation after them .
Will You destroy us because of what the false ones did ? &quot;
And thus do We make clear the communications that they may repent .
And relate to them the story of him to whom We gave Our communications , but he slipped away from them , so Satan followed him and he became one of those who went astray .
And if We had willed , We could have exalted him thereby , but he inclined to the earth and followed his own inclination .
Therefore he is like a dog : if you drive him away , he hangs out his tongue ; but if you leave him , he hangs out his tongue also .
This is what happens to people who deny Our communications .
So tell ( them ) the stories that they may reflect .
Evil is the example of the people who disbelieve in Our communications and have sinned against themselves .
He whom Allah guides is on the right path , but those whom He leads astray are most surely those who have lost .
We have created many jinn and men , whose end will be hell . They have hearts with which they do not understand , and they have eyes with which they do not see , and they have ears with which they do not hear , and they are like cattle ; but they go astray even more .
They are truly reckless .
And to Allah are the Most Beautiful Names , so call upon Him with them ; and let there be those who take a wrong attitude concerning His Names ; they shall be recompensed for what they have done .
And among those whom We created , there is a community that guides with truth and then does justice .
But those who disbelieve in Our communications , We will humiliate them step by step without them understanding how this happened .
And I will give them respite ; for verily My plans are strong .
Have they not considered that their companion is not possessed ?
He is nothing if not a clear @-@ cut warner .
Have they not considered the kingdom of the heavens and the earth , and all the things which Allah has created , and ( have they not considered ) that perhaps their term of life is drawing to an end ?
What else do they want to believe in after this proclamation ?
For him whom Allah guides astray , there is none to guide him , and He causes them to wander blindly in their rebellion .
They ask you about the hour when it will come .
Say : The knowledge of this is with my Lord .
None but He can announce it at its time .
It weighs heavily in the heavens and on earth .
It &apos;s just going to come upon you suddenly . &apos;
They question you as if you had precise knowledge of it .
Say : The knowledge of this is with my Lord , but most people do not know .
Say : I have no power to profit or harm myself unless Allah wills .
And if I had knowledge of the unseen , verily I would have been able to secure for myself the fullness of good , and evil would not have touched me .
I am but a warner and a bearer of good news for the people who believe . &quot;
It is He Who created you from a single soul , and from it He made his wife that he might rest with her .
When he was with her , she was pregnant with a light burden and walked around with it .
And when it becomes heavy , both of them pray to Allah their Lord : &quot; If You give us a good child , we shall surely be among the grateful . &quot;
But when He gives them a good ( child ) , they ascribe to Allah His gift bestowed upon them .
But Allah is Exalted above all that they associate ( with Him ) .
Will they then ( worship ) those partners who cannot create anything and are themselves created ?
And they cannot help them , nor can they help themselves .
And if you call them to the right path , they will not follow you .
It is all the same for you whether you call them or remain silent .
Those whom you call instead of Allah are self @-@ created beings like you .
Call upon them and let them answer you , if you are truthful .
Do they have feet to walk , or do they have hands to hold , or do they have eyes to see , or do they have ears to hear ?
Say : Invoke your gods , then devise cunning against me and leave me not long .
Lo ! my protector is Allah , Who has revealed the Book , and He protects the righteous .
But those whom you call upon instead of Him are not able to help you , nor can they help themselves . &quot;
And if you call them to the right path , they will not hear ( you ) .
And you see them looking after you , but they do not see .
Be tolerant , command what is right , and turn away from the ignorant .
And if you have been incited to evil by Satan , then take refuge in Allah ; surely He is Hearing , Knowing .
Lo ! those who guard ( against evil ) when a visitation of Satan befalls them , and then take notice , lo ! they will see ( their clear path ) right away .
But their ( pagan ) brethren make them go on in error , and then they do not cease ( therein ) .
If you don &apos;t bring them a sign , they say , &quot; Why don &apos;t you invent it ? &quot;
Say : I follow only that which has been revealed to me from my Lord .
These are evident proofs from your Lord and guidance and mercy for believers . &quot;
And when the Quran is recited , listen and be silent in attentiveness that you may obtain mercy .
And remember your Lord in your heart with humility and fear , without loud words in the morning and in the evening , and be not of the heedless .
Lo ! those who are with thy Lord are not too proud to serve Him ; they glorify Him and prostrate themselves before Him .
They ask you for the loot .
Say : The spoil belongs to Allah and the Messenger .
Therefore fear Allah and arrange things in harmony among yourselves and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are believers . &quot;
Indeed , believers are those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned , and they are strengthened in their faith when His verses are recited to them , and they trust in their Lord .
These are they who establish prayer and spend of what We have given them .
These are the true believers .
They enjoy ( the high ) esteem of their Lord and forgiveness and an honourable provision .
This is just as your Lord led you out of your house in righteousness , while a party of the believers were averse .
They dispute with you about the truth , after it has become manifest to them , as if they were driven to death and had it before their eyes .
And then Allah promised you from one of the two hosts that it would fall to you , and you wished that one without fighting might be for you ; but Allah desires that the truth be accomplished by His Words , and that the root of the disbelievers be cut off .
That He may manifest the truth and bring to nought the deceit , even though sinners may hate it .
When ye cried unto your Lord for help , and He answered you and promised : I will assist you with a thousand angels one after the other .
Allah said this only as glad tidings that your hearts may rest , but help comes from Allah alone ; surely Allah is Exalted , Wise .
Surely He caused sleep to fall on you as a security from Him , and He sent down water on you from the clouds that He might purify you with it and remove from you the defilement of Satan , that He might strengthen your hearts and strengthen ( your ) steps .
I am with you , so make the believers firm .
