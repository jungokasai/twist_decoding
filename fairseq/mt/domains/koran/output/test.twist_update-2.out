In the name of Allah , the Beneficent , the Merciful .
Praise be to Allah , the Lord of the Worlds .
the Merciful , the Compassionate
Sovereign on the Day of Judgment .
You ( alone ) we worship , and You ( alone ) we ask for help .
Guide us to the Straight Way
The path of those to whom You have bestowed favor , not of those who have aroused wrath , nor of those who have gone astray .
Alif Lam Mim .
This is the Book ( of Allah ) which gives no cause for doubt ; it is a guide for the righteous .
who believe in the unseen , establish the prayer , and spend out of what We have provided for them ;
And those who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you , and they are certain of the Hereafter .
These follow the guidance of their Lord , and these are the successful .
As for those who disbelieve , it is all the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them , they will not believe .
Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing , and over their eyes is a veil , and for them is a great punishment .
Some people say , &quot; We believe in God and the Last Day , &quot; but they are not believers .
They seek to deceive Allah and the believers , but they deceive not but themselves .
In their hearts is a disease , and Allah is increasing their disease , and for them is a grievous punishment for lying .
And when it is said to them , &quot; Do not cause evil upon the earth , &quot; they say , &quot; We are the doers of good . &quot;
Indeed , it is they who are the instigators , but they do not feel it .
And when it is said to them , &quot; Believe as the people have believed , &quot; they say , &quot; Should we believe as fools have believed ? &quot;
Indeed , it is they who are the fools , but they do not know .
And when they meet the believers , they say : We believe ; but when they are alone with their Satans , they say : verily we are with you ; verily we are only mocking .
Allah mocks at them and causes them to wander blindly on .
These are they who have exchanged error for guidance , but their trade did not profit them , nor are they guided .
Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire , then , when it had lit all around him , Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness , and they saw nothing .
Deaf , dumb , blind ; and they turned not back .
Or like a rainstorm from the sky , overflowing with darkness , thunder , and lightning . They thrust their fingers in their ears in fear of death .
And Allah is in His power the disbelievers .
The lightning almost snatches away their sight : whenever it gives them light , they walk through it , and when darkness falls upon them , they stand still .
And if Allah willed , He would have taken away their hearing and their sight ; verily Allah is Mighty over all .
O mankind ! Serve your Lord , who created you and those before you , that you may be righteous .
Who has made the earth a resting place for you and the sky a structure , and sent down water from the sky , and has thereby brought forth fruits as a reward for you , so Allah equals nothing when ye know .
And if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to Our servant , then produce a Sura like this and call upon your witnesses besides Allah , if you are truthful .
But if you do not - and you will not - then fear the Fire , whose fuel is men and stones , prepared for those who disbelieve .
And give glad tidings to those who believe and do good deeds , that for them will be Gardens beneath which rivers flow . And as often as they receive fruit from them , they say : This is what we have eaten before ; but they are given only the like .
And therein they shall be purified , and therein they shall be abiding .
Verily Allah is not ashamed to propound a similitude , be it of a gnat or of something higher . Now those who believe know that it is the Truth from their Lord .
But as for those who disbelieve , they say , &quot; What did Allah intend by this parable ? &quot;
He misleads many thereby , and guides many thereby ; but He misleads thereby the wicked
Those who break the covenant of Allah after it is made , and tear apart that which Allah has ordered to be joined , and cause evil in the earth ; it is they who are the losers .
How can you disbelieve in Allah , when you were dead , and He gave you life , then He caused you to die , and then He will bring you to life , when to Him you will be returned ?
He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth ; then did He turn to the heavens and raise them up to seven heavens ; and He is Aware of all things .
And when thy Lord said unto the angels : Lo ! I am about to place in the earth a follower , they said : Wilt thou appoint thereon one who will do evil therein and shed blood , when we exalt Thy praise and glorify Thee ?
He said : &quot; I know what you do not know . &quot;
And He taught Adam the names of all of them ; then He brought them before the angels , and said , &quot; Tell me the names of these things if you are truthful . &quot;
They said : Glory be to Thee ! We have no knowledge except that which Thou hast taught us ; surely Thou art the Knower , the Wise .
He said : O Adam ! tell them their names .
And when he called them by their names He said : Did I not say that I know the unseen things of the heavens and the earth , and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal ?
And when We said to the angels , &apos; Bow yourselves to Adam &apos; , so they bowed themselves , save Iblis ; he refused , and he was proud , and so he became one of the unbelievers .
And We said : O Adam ! dwell thou and thine spouse in the Garden , and eat thereof in abundance wheresoever ye will , but come not nigh this tree lest ye be of the unjust .
But Satan caused them to slip therefrom and brought them out of the state in which they were ; and We said , &apos; Get you down .
And one of you is the enemy of the other , and you shall have on the earth abodes and provision for a limited time . &quot;
Then Adam received words from his Lord , and He forgave him , surely He is the Forgiving , the Merciful . He is the Most Merciful .
We said , &quot; Go down from here , all of you . &quot;
But when My guidance comes to you , those who follow My guidance will have no fear , nor will they grieve .
But those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations will be companions of the Fire , where they will abide forever .
O Children of Israel , remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill your covenant to Me , so I fulfill My covenant to you .
And fear Me alone .
And believe in that which I have sent down confirming that which is with you , and be not the first to disbelieve therein , and exchange not My revelations for a small price , and fear Me .
And do not mix up the truth with the wrong , and do not conceal the truth while you know &#91; it &#93; .
And keep up prayer and pay the zakah and bow down with those who bow down .
Do you command people to be sincere and forget yourselves , while you read the Scripture ?
Have you then no sense ?
And help you through patience and prayer ; indeed , it is difficult except for the humble
Who know that they will meet their Lord and that to Him they will return .
O Children of Israel , remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I have preferred you over all the worlds .
And avoid the Day when no soul will vouch for another , nor will any intercession be accepted from it , nor will they be helped .
And remember that We saved you from the people of Pharaoh , who afflicted you with the worst torment , slaughtering your sons and leaving your wives alive , and in that was a great trial from your Lord .
And remember that We divided the sea for you and saved you , while We drowned the people of Pharaoh before your eyes .
Remember that We appointed with Moses forty nights , when you took the calf behind his back ( for worship ) and did wrong , and thus did wrong .
Then We forgave you so that you might be grateful .
And remember We gave Moses the Scripture , and the discernment that you may be guided .
And Moses said to his people : O my people , you have burdened yourselves with a grievous sin by your taking of the calf &#91; for worship &#93; . So turn to your Creator and kill yourselves .
That will be better for you with your Creator , then He will forgive you . Lo ! He is the Forgiving , the Merciful .
And when you said : O Musa ! we will not believe in you until we see Allah uncovered , then the thunderbolt struck you while you looked on .
Then We raised you up after your death , so that you might be grateful .
And We shaded you with clouds , and We sent down to you manna and quails , &#91; saying &#93; , &quot; Eat from the good things which We have given you , &quot; but they did not harm Us , but they did harm to themselves .
And We said : Enter this town and eat from wherever you please , and enter the gate prostrating , and say : Forgiveness , that We may forgive you your misdeeds .
And We will give ( more ) to the righteous .
But the wrongdoers changed the word with what was not said to them , so We sent down upon the wrongdoers a doom from heaven , because they had transgressed .
And when Moses prayed for water for his people , We said : Strike the rock with thy staff , and there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs .
Eat and drink of that which Allah hath given you and do no mischief on the earth .
And when you said : O Musa ! we cannot be satisfied with a single food , therefore call on your Lord to bring forth for us of what the earth grows , of the herbs and the cucumbers and the garlic and the lentils and the onions ; he said : What ! will you exchange that which is less for that which is better ?
Go back to a town and you will get what you ask for . &quot;
That was because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly , that was because they rebelled and transgressed again and again , and that was because they did not believe and because they disobeyed and were transgressors .
Lo ! those who believe , and those who are Jews , and Christians , and Sabaeans - whosoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right - their reward is with their Lord , and they shall not fear nor grieve .
And when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you , ( saying ) : Hold fast to that which We have brought to you , and remember that which is therein , perhaps you will guard ( against evil ) .
Then you turned away . Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy upon you , you would have been among the losers .
And certainly you know those of you who violated the Sabbath , so We said to them : Be apes , cast out .
And We made it a warning to all times and a lesson for the righteous .
And when Musa said to his people : Surely Allah commands you to slaughter a cow , they said : Are you mocking us ?
He said : Allah forbid that I should be one of the ignorant .
They said : Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear unto us what she is .
He said , &quot; He says she is a cow who is not too old , nor too young , but in between .
So do what you are commanded . &quot;
They said : Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what colour she should be .
He said , &quot; He says it is a yellow heifer , of bright colour , pleasing to the onlookers . &quot;
They said , &quot; Call upon your Lord for us that He may make clear to us what it is .
To us the cows are alike . If God wills , we shall be guided . &quot;
He said , &apos; He says it shall be a cow not dressed , ploughing the ground , irrigating the field , without blemish , without stain , without any blemish . &apos;
They said , &quot; Now you have come with the truth , &quot; and they sacrificed them , and they would not have done it .
And when ye had killed someone and contended among yourselves , then Allah should bring to light that which ye concealed .
So We said : &quot; Touch him with a piece of her . &quot;
Thus God brings the dead to life , and shows you His signs , so that you may understand .
Then your hearts became as hard as stones or even harder : for , there are rocks from which streams gush forth , and among them there are some of them that burst , and from which water flows out .
And there are some of them who fall down for fear of Allah , and Allah is not unaware of what you do .
Do you then hope that they will believe in you when some of them have already heard the Word of Allah and then , after they understood it , deliberately falsified it ?
And when they meet those who believe , they say : We believe ; and when they are alone one with another they say : Do you speak to them of what Allah has revealed to you , that they may argue with you before your Lord ?
Do you not understand ? &quot;
As if they know not that Allah knoweth what they conceal and what they reveal .
And among them are ignorant scholars who know not the Book , but only the desires ; and they make but guess .
But woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say , &quot; This is from God , &quot; that they may obtain it for a small price ; so woe to them for what their hands have written , and woe to them for what they have earned .
And they say , &quot; The Fire will not touch us except for a few days . &quot;
Say : Have you received a promise from Allah ?
Then surely Allah will not break His promise , or will you say about Allah that of which you have no knowledge ? &quot;
Yes , whoever earns evil and becomes engrossed in his sin , they are the people of the fire ; they will remain in it forever .
But those who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise ; they will abide therein forever .
And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel , ( saying ) : Worship none but Allah and be good to parents and to kindred and to orphans and the needy , and speak kindly to men and keep up prayer and pay the Zakah , you then turned away except a few of yourselves , turning away .
And when We made a covenant with you : You shall not shed your blood or turn yourselves out of your dwellings , and you promised it , and you bear witness ( to it ) .
Yet it is you who slay each other and drive out a party of you from their homes , acting together against them in sin and injustice .
But if they come to you as captives , you ransom them , when their expulsion was forbidden you .
Do you then believe in a part of the Scripture and disbelieve another part ?
For those of you who do this , there is no retribution except disgrace in this life , and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be punished to the severest of chastisement , and Allah is not heedless of what you do .
These are they who have purchased the life of this world for the Hereafter , so the punishment shall not be lightened for them , nor shall they be helped .
Certainly We gave Moses the Book and followed him with the apostles , and We gave Jesus , the son of Mary , manifest proofs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit .
But whenever a Messenger brought to you something that did not please you , you were arrogant and declared some to be liars , and killed others !
And they said , &quot; Our hearts are insensitive . &quot;
Allah has cursed them because of their disbelief , so few of them believe .
And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming that which was with them , and before that they had begged ( for ) victory over those who disbelieved , but when there came to them that which they knew , they disbelieved in it .
So the curse of Allah be upon the disbelievers !
Evil is that for which they sell their souls , and disbelieve in that which Allah has sent down , lest that Allah should send down of His bounty upon whom He wills of His servants .
So they have borne on themselves wrath upon wrath , and there is a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers .
When it is said to them , &quot; Believe in what Allah has revealed , &quot; they say , &quot; We believe in what was revealed to us , &quot; while they reject what has been thereafter , even though it is the truth confirming what is with them .
Say : Why then did you kill the prophets of Allah before , if you are believers ?
And Moses came to you with clear proofs , then you took the calf after it left and did wrong .
And when We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you ( saying ) : Hold fast that which We have given you , and hear , they said : We hear , but we disobey .
And they were made to be drunk in their hearts with the calf because of their infidelity .
Say : Evil is that which your faith commands you if you are believers .
Say : If the abode of the Hereafter is with Allah only for you and not for any other mankind , then long for death if you are truthful .
But they will never ask for it , because of what their hands have sent before , and Allah knows the wrongdoers .
And thou wilt find them the greediest of mankind for life , and more so than those who worship idols .
Each one of them would have a life of a thousand years , and he would not save himself from the torment , even if he were granted a great old age ; and Allah sees what they do .
Say : &quot; Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel , he has sent it down to your heart with authority from Allah , confirming what preceded it , and guidance and good news for the believers . &quot;
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His apostles and Gabriel and Michael , surely Allah is an enemy to the unbelievers .
And indeed We have sent down to you clear verses , and none deny them except the unjust .
Is it not always the case , that whenever they make a covenant , a party of them reject it , and most of them do not believe .
And when there came to them a messenger from Allah confirming what was with them , a party of them to whom the Book was given threw the Book behind their backs as if they did not know .
And they followed what the devils were reciting during the kingdom of Solomon . Solomon disbelieved not , but the devils disbelieved , taught the people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babylon , Harut and Marut , but the two taught nothing to anyone except that they said : &quot; We are but a temptation , so do not disbelieve . &quot;
And they learned from them the ways to cause discord between man and his wife .
But they did not harm anyone with it except with Allah &apos;s authority .
And they learned what harms them and does not benefit them .
And yet they knew that whoever bought it shall have no portion in the hereafter ; surely evil is that for which they have sold their souls , if they but knew !
And if they had believed and feared Allah , the reward from Allah would have been better , if they only knew .
O you who believe ! do not say : Pay attention to us , but say : Look to us , and listen ( to the Prophet ) .
Those who disbelieve among the owners of the Scripture and those who worship idols do not wish that any good should be revealed to you from your Lord , but Allah distinguishes with His mercy whom He pleases , and Allah is Abundant in Grace .
When We abrogate a ya or cause it to be forgotten , We produce one better than it , or one equivalent .
Do you not know that Allah has power over all things ?
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth , and besides Allah you have no guardian or helper ?
Or do you want to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before ?
And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the right way .
Many of the People of the Scripture would like to turn you back to disbelief after you have believed , out of envy in their minds after the truth has become clear to them .
But pardon and forgive , until God issues His decision ; surely God is powerful over everything .
And keep up prayer and give the zakah , and whatever good you send before for yourselves , you shall find it with Allah .
Surely Allah sees what you do .
And they say , &quot; None will enter Paradise except Jews and Christians . &quot;
Say : Bring your proof , if you are truthful .
And whoever submits himself to Allah and does good , he shall have his reward from his Lord , and they shall have no fear , nor shall they grieve .
And the Jews say : &quot; The Christians are not leaning on anything , &quot; and the Christians say : &quot; The Jews are not leaning on anything , &quot; while they are reading the Book . Just as they are speaking , those who have no knowledge were speaking .
Then Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they have been disputing .
Who is more unjust than he who prevents His name from being called in the mosques of Allah and strives to destroy them ? Those must not enter them except in fear .
For them there is disgrace in this world , and for them in the Hereafter is a severe punishment .
And to Allah belong the east and the west ; so wherever you turn , there is the face of Allah ; surely Allah is Ample , Knowing .
And they say : Allah hath taken unto Himself a son .
Glory be to Him !
Unquestionably , to Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth , all things are subject to Him .
The Creator of the heavens and the earth ; when He decrees a thing , He only says to it , &quot; Be , &quot; and it is .
And those who have no knowledge say : Why does not Allah speak to us and not send to us a sign ?
So said those who were before them , as they speak : their hearts are alike . and their hearts are alike .
We have made the ayat clear for people who are certain in their faith .
We have sent you with the truth , a bearer of good news and a warner , and you are not responsible for the people of Hell .
With you the Jews or the Christians will not be satisfied , unless you follow their creed .
Say : Allah &apos;s guidance is the true guidance ; and if thou followest their request after knowledge hath come to thee , thou wilt have neither guardian nor helper in the sight of Allah .
Those to whom We have given the Book recite it as it ought to be read ; those believe in it ; those who disbelieve in it , they are the losers .
O Children of Israel , remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I have put you over all the nations .
And fear the day when no soul will be able to take anything for another , and no ransom will be accepted from it , nor will any intercession benefit it , nor will they be helped .
And when his Lord tested Abraham with His words , and he fulfilled them , He said , &quot; I will make you an Imam of mankind . &quot;
Said Abraham , &apos; And of my seed ; &apos; He said , &apos; My covenant shall not be with those who do wrong . &apos;
And when We made the House a place of refuge for men and a place of safety ( said We ) : Take the place of Abraham as a place of prayer . And We have enjoined on Abraham and Ishmael : Purify My House for those who encircle it and those who retreat , those who bow down and those who prostrate .
And when Abraham said , &quot; My Lord , make this a secure place , and give fruits to those of them who dwell therein who believe in Allah and the Last Day , &quot; He said : &quot; I shall give him who disbelieves a little while then deliver him up to the punishment of the Fire , and what a bad lot that is ! &quot;
And when Abraham and Ishmael were building the foundations of the House , he said : Our Lord , accept from us ; surely You are the Hearing , the Knowing .
And make us submissive unto Thee , and of our seed a nation submissive unto Thee .
And show us our worship and turn to us again Your grace ; for indeed , You are the Most Merciful , the Most Gracious , Most Merciful .
And Our Lord ! raise among them a messenger from among them who recites to them Your Words and teaches them the Book and Wisdom and purifies them , and most surely You are the Exalted in Might , the Wise . &quot;
And who turns away from the faith of Abraham , except he who fools himself ?
We chose him in this world , and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous .
When his Lord said to him , &apos; Be submissive , &apos; he said , &apos; I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds . &apos;
And Abraham instructed his sons to do this and so did Jacob : &quot; My sons , Allah has chosen religion for you , so do not die except to be submissive to Allah . &quot;
Were you witnesses when Jacob was dying , and he said to his sons , &quot; What will you worship , when I am gone ? &quot; They said , &quot; We worship your God , the God of your forefathers , Abraham , and Isaac , the One God , and to Him we are submissive . &quot;
That is a community that has passed ; for them is what they have earned , and for you is what you have earned .
You will not be held responsible for their deeds .
And they say : If ye are Jews or Christians , then ye shall be guided .
Say : &quot; Yes !
The religion of Abraham , the upright , who was not one of the idolaters . &quot;
Say , &quot; We believe in God and what has been revealed to us , and in what was revealed to Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob and the tribes , and in what was given to Moses and Jesus , and the prophets from their Lord .
We make no distinction between them , and to Him we have submitted .
If they believe in the way you believe , they will be guided , but if they turn away , they will only be dissenters ; but Allah will suffice for you against them , and He is the Hearing , the Knowing , the Knowing .
This is the law of Allah . And who is better than Allah in law ?
And to Him do we serve .
Say : Do you dispute with us about Allah , when He is our Lord and your Lord ?
But we have our deeds , and you have your deeds , and to Him we are sincere .
Or do you say that Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , and the tribes were Jews or Christians ? &quot;
Say : Do you know better , or does Allah ?
And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has received from Allah ?
And Allah is not unaware of what you do .
That is a community that has passed ; for them is what they have earned , and for you is what you have earned .
You will not be held responsible for their deeds .
The fools among the people will say : &quot; What has moved them away from the qibla , which they have been following ? &quot;
Say : To Allah belong the east and the west , He guides whom He pleases to a straight path .
And thus We have made you a community among , that you may be witnesses over the people , and that the Messenger may be a witness over you .
And We did not make the qiblah by which you were guided except in order that We may distinguish him who follows the Messenger from him who turns back on his heels ; and most surely it was a hard task except for those whom Allah guided .
And Allah is not He Who makes your faith go astray ; most surely Allah is Compassionate , Merciful to mankind .
We have seen you turning your face towards the heaven , and We shall now turn you to a qibla with which you will be satisfied .
So turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque , and wherever you are , turn your faces toward it .
Those who have been given the Book know it is the truth from their Lord , and God is not heedless of the things they do .
But if you gave those who were given the Book all the proofs , they would not follow your qiblah , and you will not follow their qiblah , nor will any of them follow the qiblah of each other .
And if you follow their desires , after the knowledge that has come to you , you will surely be one of the wrongdoers .
Those to whom We have given the Book know it as they know their own sons , and some of them hide the truth , while they know .
This is the truth from your Lord , so be not of those who doubt .
Everyone has a direction towards which he turns .
Wherever you are , Allah will bring you all together . Indeed , Allah is over all things competent .
And from whence thou comest , turn thy face toward the Sacred Mosque ; surely this is the truth from thy Lord .
And Allah is not unaware of what you do .
And wherever you come from , turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque ; and wherever you are , turn your faces towards it , so that people may not have any argument against you , except those of them who are unjust ; so do not fear them , but fear Me .
And that I may complete My favor upon you and that you may be guided .
Just as We have sent among you a messenger from among you who recites to you Our verses and purifies you and teaches you the Book and wisdom and teaches you what you did not know ,
So remember Me , that I may remember you . And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me .
O you who believe ! seek help in patience and prayer ; surely Allah is with the patient .
And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah : dead , they are alive , but ye perceive not .
And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger , and loss of wealth and lives and fruits ; but give good news to the patient ,
Who , when afflicted with calamity , say : &quot; Surely we belong to Allah , and to Him we shall return . &quot;
Those are the ones upon whom your Lord will have blessings and mercy , and they will be guided .
Indeed , As Safa and Al @-@ Marwa are of the places of worship of Allah ; and whoever goes to the House , or the Umrah , it is no fault for him to walk between them ; and whoever does good voluntarily , God is Recognizable , All @-@ knowing .
Those who conceal what We have revealed of clear proofs and guidance , after We have clarified them in the Book for mankind , God curses them , and they curse the curse of those who curse .
Except those who repent and amend and make themselves clear ( the truth ) , to whom I turn again My mercy ; for I am the Merciful , the Merciful , the Merciful , the Merciful .
Lo ! those who disbelieve and die in their disbelief , on them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of mankind , altogether .
therein they shall be forever ; the chastisement shall not be lightened for them , neither shall they be given respite .
Your God is One God ; there is no god but He , the Compassionate , the Merciful .
Verily , in the creation of the heavens and the earth , and in the alternation of the night and the day , and in the ships that sail through the sea with that which benefits mankind , and in the water ( which ) Allah has sent down from the heavens , and with it revives the earth after its death , and sends forth to it all creatures of all kinds , and in alternation of winds , and the clouds of subjection between the heavens and the earth , are signs for a people who understand .
And there are men who take to themselves , besides Allah , the like of Him and love as one should love Allah .
And those who believe love Allah more , and when those who do wrong behold the torment , that all power is with Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment .
When those who were followed disown those who followed ( them ) , and they behold the doom , while the bonds are cut off from them !
And those who followed them say : &quot; If only we could return ( to the land ) , we would disown them as they disown us . &quot;
Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets to them , and they will not come out of the Fire .
O mankind ! Eat of that which is lawful and good in the earth , and follow not the footsteps of the Satan ; surely he is your manifest enemy .
He only commands you to do evil and abominable , and that you should say about God what you do not know .
And when it is said to them , &quot; Follow what Allah has revealed , &quot; they say , &quot; We will follow that in which we found our fathers , &quot; even if their fathers did not understand and were not guided .
The likeness of those who disbelieve is as the likeness of one who shouts to any beast that hears nothing but shouts and a voice .
Deaf , dumb and blind , they do not understand .
O you who believe ! Eat of the good things which We have prepared for you , and give thanks to Allah , if it is Him alone that you serve .
He has forbidden you only ( the eating ) of the dead , of the dead , of blood , of the flesh of swine , and of that of which anything other than Allah has been invoked .
But if anyone is compelled to do so , without covetousness and beyond measure , there is no blame on him ; surely Allah is Forgiving , Merciful . Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
Those who conceal what Allah has revealed of the Book and sell it for a small price , they eat nothing but fire in their bellies , and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection , nor will He purify them , and they shall have a painful punishment .
They are the ones who bought error for guidance , and punishment for forgiveness ; how enduring can they be to the Fire !
That is because Allah has revealed the Book with the truth , and indeed those who dispute about the Book are in great enmity .
Righteousness is not when you face towards the East or the West ; but righteousness is when one believes in Allah , the Last Day , the Angels , the Book and the Prophets , and the possession , though one loves it , of kinsfolk , orphans , the poor , the Son of the Way , beggars and slaves , that one may establish prayer and pay the Zakah ; it is those who keep their promises when they have given them ; and those who are patient in misery , distress and in times of war ; it is they who are truthful and pious .
O ye who believe ! Retaliation is prescribed unto you for the slain ; the free for the free , the slave for the slave , and the female for the female .
But if any one is forgiven by his brother , then the execution is to be done in a dignified manner .
This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy .
So whoever transgresses thereafter , for him is a painful punishment .
In retaliation there is life for you , O people of understanding .
Perhaps you will have fear of God .
It is prescribed for you that when death approaches one of you , if he leaves wealth , he shall make a bequest for his parents and relatives in an honourable manner .
This is an obligation for the righteous .
But whoever changes it after he has heard it , the blame shall be on those who alter it ; surely Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
But whoever fears from the testator injustice or wrongdoing , and establishes peace between the two , there shall be no blame on him ; surely Allah is Oft @-@ Forgiving , Merciful .
O ye who believe ! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you , that ye may ( perhaps ) fear .
For a certain number of days ; but whoever among you is sick or on a journey , let him fast for a number of other days ; and for those who are able to bear it with great difficulty ( it ) shall be a substitute for the feeding of a needy person .
And whoever does good of his own accord , it is better for him .
And that you fast is better for you , if only you knew .
The month of Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guidance for mankind and clear proofs of the guidance and the distinction ; so whoever of you is present in the month , he shall fast in it .
And whoever is ill or on a journey , then ( let him fast ) a number of other days ; Allah desires ease for you , He does not desire that you should complete the term , and that you may glorify Allah that He has guided you , so that you may be grateful .
And when My servants ask you about Me , then am I near ; I hear the cry of the calling one when he calls Me .
So let them listen to Me and believe in Me ; perhaps they will be guided .
It is lawful for you to approach your wives on the night of fasting ; they are security for you , and you are security for them ; and you are the same for them .
Allah knows that you have been deceiving yourselves , and He has turned to you His mercy , and pardoned you .
So now consort with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you .
Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes clear to you from the black thread ; then complete the fast until night .
It is not for you to have intercourse with them , while you have withdrawn to the mosques ; these are the limits of Allah , so do not approach them .
Thus does Allah clarify His signs to mankind , so that they may be afraid .
And do not swallow up your property among yourselves unjustly , and do not proffer it to the authorities , in order that you may wrongfully devour a part of the property of men , while you know .
They ask you about the new moons .
Say : &apos; They are times fixed for people and for the haggis . &apos;
And it is not righteousness that you enter houses from the back , but righteousness is &#91; in &#93; fear &#91; of Allah .
So enter houses through their doors and fear Allah .
You may well be successful .
And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you , but do not transgress ; surely Allah does not love the transgressors .
And kill them wherever you come across them , and expel them from whence they have expelled you ; and the deception is worse than killing .
And do not fight them near the Sacred Mosque until they fight you there .
But if they fight you , then kill them ; such is the recompense of the unbelievers .
But if they cease , then Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
Fight them until there is no dissension , and religion is for Allah .
But if they cease , then there should be no violence except against those who do wrongdoers .
The sacred month is for the sacred month , and for the sacred things there is retribution . So whoever acts violently against you , he acts violently as he did violently against you , and fear Allah and know that Allah is with the righteous .
Spend in the way of Allah , and do not cast yourselves with your own hands into ruin , and do good .
Surely Allah loves those who do good .
And complete the Hajj and the Umrah for Allah .
But if you are prevented ( from doing so ) , offer an offering that is easy for you , and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination .
And if any of you is ill , or has an ailment of his head , he shall make up by fasting , or charity , or offering a sacrifice .
And when you are secure , then whoever wants to perform Umrah with the hagg shall offer an offering that is easy for him .
Anyone who cannot find one , shall fast for three days during the Hajj and seven when you return , that is , ten in all .
This is for those whose family is not in the area of the holy mosque .
And fear Allah and know that Allah is severe in punishment .
The months of the Hagg are well known to all ; whoever makes up his mind to hagg shall abstain from sexual intercourse , and shall not commit iniquity or lewd speech during the Hagg , or the Haggling of the Hajj .
And whatever good you do , Allah knows it .
And take provision for the journey , but the best provision is righteousness .
And fear Me , O you who have insight !
There is no fault in you if you seek the bounty of your Lord .
And when ye hurry from Arafat , remember Allah at Ai @-@ Masaril @-@ haram , and remember Him how He guided you , though ye were of the erring before .
Then rush on from where the people are and ask Allah for forgiveness .
Lo ! Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And when you have completed your rites , then remember Allah as you remember your forefathers or rather &#91; with &#93; greater remembrance .
Among the people there are those who say , &quot; Our Lord , give us good in this world , &quot; but in the Hereafter they will have no share .
And among them is he who says , &quot; Our Lord ! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter , and spare us from the punishment of the Fire . &quot;
These will have a share of what they have earned , and Allah is swift in account .
And remember Allah during the numbered days . And whosoever hastens off in two days , there is no sin on him , and whosoever tarries longer , on him there is no sin if he fears Allah .
And fear Allah and know that you will be brought back to Him .
And among men there is he whose speech about this world may astonish you , and he calls to Allah to witness what is in his heart and he is the most contentious of the adversaries .
When he turns away , he sets out to spread corruption in the land , destroying crops and cattle ; but God does not love evil .
And when it is said to him , &quot; Fear Allah , &quot; he becomes overpowered by sinful pride . And what a bad resting place for him !
And among men is he who gives himself , seeking the pleasure of Allah ; and Allah is Most Gracious to the Servants .
O you who believe !
Enter into salvation all of you , and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan . He is your manifest enemy .
And if ye fall after the evidence hath come unto you , then know that Allah is Mighty , Wise .
Are they waiting for God to appear to them in the clouds , and with Him the angels , so that the matter is settled ?
And to Allah will be returned all things .
Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have given them .
And whoever changes the favor of Allah after it has come to him , then indeed , Allah is severe in punishment .
The life of this world is attractive to those who disbelieve and disbelieve , and they ridicule those who believe .
But those who guard against Allah will be above them on the Day of Resurrection , and Allah provides for whomever He wishes without any measure .
Mankind were one nation ; then God sent the Prophets as bearers of good news and warners and He sent down to them the Book with the truth , that He might judge between the people concerning that whereon they were at variance ; and it was those who were given it , after the clear arguments had come to them , who disagreed with one another ; but by His leave Allah guided those who believed to the truth over which they disagreed , and Allah guided whom He wills to a straight path .
Or do you think that you will enter Paradise without such ( thing ) as came upon those who passed away before you ?
Affliction and adversity befell them and they were shaken until the Messenger and those who believed with him said : &quot; When will the help of Allah come ? &quot;
But surely the help of Allah is nigh .
They ask you what they should spend .
Say : Whatever good you spend , it is for parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the son of the wayfarer ; and whatever good you do , surely Allah knows it .
Fighting is prescribed for you , even if you dislike it .
Yet it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you , and it may be that you love a thing which is bad for you .
And Allah knows , but you do not know .
They ask you about fighting in the holy month .
Say , &quot; Fighting in it is severe .
But to turn away from God &apos;s way , and disbelieve in Him , and to deny access to the sacred mosque and expel from it its inhabitants is more grievous before Allah . And the seduction is more grievous than killing . &quot;
And they will not cease to fight you until they turn you away from your faith , if they are able .
But whoever of you turns away from his faith and dies an unbeliever , those are the ones whose works will be in this world and the Hereafter .
They will be the dwellers of the Fire , to dwell therein forever .
Verily those who believe and have emigrated and strive hard in the way of Allah , these are they who hope for the mercy of Allah , and Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
They ask you about intoxicants and gambling .
Say : &quot; In them is great evil , and in them is benefit for men ; but their evil is greater than their benefit . &quot;
And they ask you what they should spend .
Say : &quot; The surplus . &quot;
Thus does Allah make clear to you the verses that you may reflect .
On this world and the hereafter . They ask you about the orphans ; say : It is good for them to improve ; and if you join your affairs with theirs , they are your brethren ; and Allah knows the mischief @-@ maker from him who does good , and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have brought you into hardship ; surely Allah is Mighty , Wise .
And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe .
A believing slave woman is better than an idolatress , even though she may please you .
And do not marry idolaters , until they believe .
A believing servant is better than an idolater , even though he may please you .
Those call to the Fire , but God calls to Paradise and pardon , by His leave , and He makes His signs clear to the people , that they may remember Him .
And they ask you about menstruation .
Say , &quot; It is an ailment .
So keep away from women during menstruation , and do not approach them until they are clean . Then when they are clean , approach them as Allah has commanded you .
Truly , Allah loves those who turn to Him in repentance and purify themselves .
Your wives are a field for you , so till your fields as you will , and send &#91; good &#93; beforehand for you .
And fear Allah and know that you will meet Him .
And promise good tidings to the believers .
And make not Allah , by your oaths , a hindrance from being honest and righteous and making peace among men ; and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Allah will not take you to task for carelessness in your oaths , but He will take you to task for that which your hearts have earned ; and Allah is Forgiving , Forbearing .
Those who swear abstinence from their wives shall wait four months , then if they want to give up their oath , surely Allah is Oft @-@ Forgiving , Most Merciful .
But if they resolve on divorce , then surely Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Divorced women should wait for three periods , and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day .
And their husbands have the primary right to take them back if they desire reconciliation .
Women have rights equal to their obligations over them to exercise kindness , but men have a degree above them .
And Allah is Exalted in Might , Wise .
Divorce is twice , then ( men should keep wives ) in a proper manner or dismiss them for good .
And it is not lawful for you to take back anything of what you have given them , unless both fear that they will not be able to keep &#91; the &#93; boundaries of Allah .
And if ye fear that they may not be able to keep the limits of Allah , then there is no blame on either of them in that which they spend therewith .
These are the limits of Allah , so do not transgress them ; and whoever transgresses the limits of Allah , it is those who are the wrongdoers .
And if he divorces her , then she is not lawful to him any more , until she marries another man .
If the latter divorces them , there is no blame on either of them if they return to each other , provided they think that they can keep the commandments of Allah . These are the limits of Allah which He makes clear to those who know .
And when you divorce women and they approach &#91; the &#93; fulfilling their term , either retain them in a kind manner or release them in a kind manner , and do not keep them , to transgress , to harass &#91; the women &#93; .
Whoever does this wrongs himself .
Do not make a mockery of God &apos;s revelations . Remember the favor of God which He has bestowed upon you , and what He revealed to you of the Book and Wisdom to exhort you .
And fear Allah and know that Allah is Knower of all things .
When you divorce women and they have reached their term , do not prevent them from marrying their husbands , if they agree amicably .
This is an admonition for those of you who believe in Allah and the Last Day .
That is better for you , and purer , and Allah knows and you do not know .
It is for the father to provide for them and clothe them with kindness , no soul shall be asked to do anything beyond what it can do .
A mother shall not be harmed because of her child , nor shall he to whom the child is born because of his child .
If they both decide on weaning , by mutual consent , and after counselling , there is no blame on them .
And if you desire to breastfeed your children , there is no fault in you , provided you pay what you have agreed with kindly .
And fear Allah , and know that Allah is Seer of what ye do .
If those of you who are taken away leave wives , they ( widows ) shall wait four months and ten days , and when they have reached their term , then there is no fault for you if they have good authority over themselves , and Allah is well acquainted with what you do . Allah is Knowing of what you do .
And there is no blame on you if you make a hint of a marriage or conceal it in your hearts ; Allah knows that you will remember them , but do not make an appointment with them secretly unless you say a fitting word , and do not make a firm decision about marriage until the waiting period is fulfilled ; and know that Allah is aware of what is in your souls , so be on your guard against Him , and know that Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing .
There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before touching them or giving them a bridegroom ; but bestow on them ( a sustenance ) the wealthy according to his means , and the poor according to his means , a sustenance kindly .
&#91; This is &#93; an obligation for the righteous .
If you divorce them before you have touched them , but after you have given them a dowry , give them half of what you have given , unless they remit it ( to you ) or he whose hand is the marriage bond forgives it .
And if ye forgive it , it is nearer to righteousness .
And do not forget to be kind to one another . Allah sees well all that you do .
Observe the prayers , just like the intermediate prayer , and stand before Allah humbly submissive .
But if you are in fear , then ( pray ) on foot or riding , and when you are safe , remember Allah , as He has taught you that which you did not know .
And those of you who die and leave wives behind , let them bequeath unto their wives a year &apos;s provision and they shall not be expelled .
But if they leave their homes , it is no offence to you if they control themselves for what they do for themselves .
And Allah is Exalted in Might , Wise .
And to provide for the divorced women in a kind manner is an obligation for the righteous . This is an obligation for the righteous .
Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses ; perhaps you will comprehend .
Have you not considered those who went forth from their homes in their thousands , fearing death ?
Then He gave them life ; surely God is bountiful to men , but most men are not grateful .
And fight in the way of Allah , and know that Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Who is he that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan , that He may multiply it unto him manifold ?
Allah diminishes and multiplies ; and unto Him ye shall be returned .
Have you not considered the nobles of the Children of Israel after Moses , when they said to a prophet of theirs , &quot; Appoint for us a king that we may fight in the way of Allah . &quot;
He said , &quot; Is it not possible that , if it is prescribed for you , you will not fight ? &quot;
They said : &quot; Why should we not fight in the way of Allah , when we have been driven out of our homes and separated from our sons ? &quot;
But when fighting was ordained for them , they turned away , except for a few of them ; and Allah knows the unjust .
And their Prophet said to them , &quot; Indeed Allah has appointed Saul to be king over you . &quot; So they asked : &quot; How can he have dominion over us , whereas we are entitled to dominion than he , and he has not been given enough wealth ? &quot; He said : &quot; Indeed Allah has chosen him above you , and has bestowed him with abundant knowledge and physical advantages , and Allah gives His dominion to whomever He wills ; and Allah is Exalted , Knowing .
And their Prophet said to them : Surely a sign of his kingdom is that the Ark shall come to you ; therein shall be tranquillity from your Lord and a relics left by the children of Musa and the children of Aaron , carried by angels .
Surely in that is a sign for you , if you are believers . &quot;
And when Saul went forth with the hosts , he said : Surely Allah will try you by a river .
Whoever drinks from it is not of me , and whoever does not taste it is indeed of me , except he who draws &#91; thereof &#93; with his hand . &quot;
And they drank from it , except for a few of them .
And when they had crossed the river , he and those who believed with him , they said : We have no power today against Goliath and his hosts .
But those who knew that they would meet Allah said , &quot; How often has a small party vanquished a large party by permission of Allah ?
And Allah is with the patient . &quot;
And when they marched out against Goliath and his hosts , they said : Our Lord ! grant us abundant patience , strengthen our steps and help us against the disbelievers .
So they smote them by the leave of Allah , and David slew Goliath , and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom and taught him what He willed .
And if Allah had not withheld some people by others , the earth would have been filled with evil .
But Allah is full of bounty to all the worlds .
These are the verses of Allah .
We recite them to you in truth , and indeed , you are of the messengers .
These messengers : We gave some of them priority over others .
Among them are those to whom Allah spoke , and some He raised in rank .
And if Allah had willed , those after them would not have fought one another after the clear proofs had come to them , but they differed .
Some of them believed , and some disbelieved .
If Allah had so willed , they would not have fought one another .
And Allah does what He wills .
O you who believe ! spend out of what We have given you before a day comes in which there is no deed , no friendship nor intercession ; and the unbelievers are the unjust .
Allah , there is no deity except Him , the Living , the Everlasting .
Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him .
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth ; who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission ?
He knows what is before them and what is behind them , and they do not understand anything of His knowledge except what He wills .
His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth , and it is not difficult for Him to guard them , and He is the Exalted , the Exalted .
There is no compulsion in faith .
The right path has become distinct from the wrong path .
So whoever disbelieves in false gods and believes in Allah has grasped the most secure support , with which there is no break ; and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Allah is the Guardian of those who believe ; He brings them out of the darkness into the light ; and ( as for ) those who disbelieve , their guardians are the idols ; they bring them forth from the light into the darkness ; they shall be the inmates of the fire , in it they shall abide .
Have you not considered him who argued with Abraham about his Lord , because God had given him sovereignty ?
When Abraham said : &quot; My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death , &quot; he said : &quot; I give life and cause death . &quot;
Abraham said : &quot; It is Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the East , so let it rise from the West . &quot; So the disbeliever was confused .
And Allah does not guide the wrongdoers .
Or ( have you not considered ) the one who passed by a city that lay desolate in ruins ?
Then he said : &quot; How will Allah restore this to life after its destruction ? &quot;
So Allah raised him up for a hundred years , then raised him up .
He said , &quot; How long have you remained ? &quot;
He said , &quot; I have remained a day or part of a day , &quot; and He said , &quot; Yet , you have remained a hundred years .
Now look at your food and your drink . They are not corrupted .
And look at your donkey ; We will make you a sign for the people .
And look at the bones , how We assemble them , and then clothe them with flesh . And when it was made clear to him , he said , I know that Allah is Exalted in all things .
And when Ibrahim said : My Lord ! show me how Thou givest life to the dead , He said : Dost thou not then believe ?
He said : &quot; Yes !
But to reassure my heart . &quot;
He said , &quot; Take four birds , and dismember them , then put some pieces on each hill , then call them .
And know that Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise . &quot;
The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is as the parable of a grain that sprouts seven ears , in each ear a hundred grains .
And Allah multiplies &#91; it &#93; to whom He pleases , and Allah is All @-@ Encompassing , All @-@ knowing .
Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah , then do not follow up what they have spent with reproach or rebellion , their reward shall be theirs from their Lord , and there shall be no fear on them , nor shall they grieve .
Good words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by an evil deed ; and Allah is the kingdom , and He is the Most Gentle .
O ye who believe ! make not your charity unprofitable by reproach or by injury , like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men , and believeth not in Allah and the Last Day .
The likeness of him is as the likeness of a rock with dirt on it , and a torrent of rain falls on it and leaves it hard .
They will not gain anything from their own deeds ; and Allah does not guide the disbelievers .
And the parable of those who spend their wealth seeking Allah &apos;s good pleasure and to strengthen their souls is that of a garden on a hillside : a downpour strikes it , and it produces its fruit twice ; and if there is no downpour it is dew .
And Allah is Seeing of what you do .
Does one of you desire that he should have a garden of palms and vines with streams flowing beneath it ; in it shall all kinds of fruits abound ; and old age shall overtake him while he has weak offspring , and a whirlwind of fire shall overtake him , and he be burned ?
Thus does Allah make clear to you the signs . Perhaps you are thinking .
O ye who believe ! Spend of that which ye have earned and of that which We bring forth from the earth for you , and seek not the bad ( of it ) that ye yourselves have not taken , except with your eyes closed , to spend ; and know that Allah is the Exalted , and Glory to Him ( is ) .
Satan threatens you with poverty and commands you to immorality , while Allah promises you His forgiveness and bounty ; and Allah is All @-@ Encompassing and Knowing .
He gives wisdom to whom He wills , and whoever has been given wisdom has been given great riches , but those who are reminded are the wise .
And whatever you spend or pledge to do , Allah knows it . And the wrongdoers will not find any helpers .
If you give charity openly , it is good ; and if you conceal it and give it to the poor , it is better for you , and it will atone for your misdeeds ; and Allah is Aware of what you do .
Their guidance is not your responsibility , but God guides whom He wills .
Whatever good you spend is for yourselves , and you do not spend except to seek Allah &quot; s guidance , and whatever good you spend shall be repaid to you in full , and you shall not be wronged .
( This is for ) the poor , who , in Allah &apos;s way , are prevented ( from moving ) freely in the land ; the ignorant consider them rich because of ( their ) restraint ; they are rich because of their restraint .
But you will recognize them by their appearance ; they do not beg people insistently .
And whatever good you spend , surely Allah knows it .
Those who spend their wealth by night and day , secretly and openly , they shall have their reward from their Lord , and they shall have no fear , nor shall they grieve .
Those who swallow up interest should not be left except as one whom Satan has seized and driven to madness .
This is because they say : &quot; Trade is just like taking interest . &quot;
But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest .
And whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists , he shall have that which is already done , and his cause is with Allah .
But whoever does it again will be the inmates of the Fire , wherein they will abide forever .
Allah will destroy usury and increase charity , and Allah does not love anyone who is a stubborn disbeliever and a doer .
Those who believe , and do deeds of righteousness , and keep up prayer , and pay the Zakah their reward shall be from their Lord , and no fear shall be on them , neither shall they sorrow .
O you who believe ! Be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah , and relinquish what is left of interest if you are believers .
And if you do not do it , then war is declared to you from Allah and His Messenger .
But if you repent , then you shall have your capital , so that you shall not do wrong and you shall not be wronged .
And whoever is in hardship , let him give respite till relief ; and if you give charity , it is better for you , if only you knew .
And fear the Day when you will be brought back to Allah .
Then every soul will be repaid for what it has earned , and they will not be wronged .
O you who believe ! When you grant a loan or take it out for a fixed term , write it down , and let a scribe write it down with truth in your presence .
Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him , so let him write , and let the debtor dictate , and let him fear Allah , his Lord , and leave nothing of it out of it .
And if the debtor is a fool , or weak , or unable to dictate , then let his guardian dictate for him .
And call to witness two witnesses from among your men , and if there are not two men , then a man and two women from those whom you regard as witnesses , so that if one of the two errs , the other of them reminds them .
And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called , and do not disdain writing it down , be it small or large , until the appointed term .
That is more just in the sight of Allah , more reliable in testimony , and more likely to prevent you from doubt , except when it is an immediately available commodity , which goes from hand to hand among you ; then it is no offence for you unless you write it down .
And take witnesses when you trade with one another , and let no harm be done to scribe or witness .
And if ye do it , lo ! it is a sin of you .
Fear Allah , and Allah teaches you , and Allah is Aware of all things .
And if ye are on a journey and ye find not a scribe , then let there be a pledge taken ; then , if one of you entrusts to the other , let the one to whom it is entrusted restore that which was entrusted to him and fear Allah , his Lord , and do not suppress the testimony ; and whoever conceals it , his heart is indeed tainted with guilt ; and Allah is ever Aware of what ye do .
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth , and whether you manifest what is in your hearts or conceal it , Allah will bring you to account for it ; then He will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills , and Allah is over all things competent .
The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord , and so do the believers . Each one believes in God , His angels , His Books , and His messengers ; We make no distinction between any of His messengers .
And they say : We hear and obey , grant Thy forgiveness , our Lord , and unto Thee is the return .
Allah does not require any soul beyond its capacity .
For it will be what it earns , and against it is what it earns ; and Our Lord , do not take us to task if we forget or make a mistake .
Our Lord , and lay not on us a burden like that which You have laid on those before us .
Our Lord , do not charge us with that which we have no strength .
And pardon us , and forgive us , and have mercy on us .
You are our protector , so help us against the people of the unbelievers . &quot;
Alif Lam Mim .
Allah , there is no deity except Him , the Living , the Everlasting .
He hath revealed unto thee the Scripture with truth , confirming that which was before it , and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel .
before , as guidance for mankind , and He has sent down the Book to discern .
Verily those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah will have a severe punishment , and Allah is Mighty and Lord of Retribution .
Nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah .
It is He who shapes you in the womb as He wills .
There is no god but He , the Mighty , the Wise .
He it is Who has revealed to you the Book ; in it are verses that are clear ( in truth ) , and they are the foundation of the Book and others that are of different interpretations ; but those in whose hearts is ( the inclination ) to turn away follow what is to be interpreted therein , that they may cause dissension , and seek interpretation ( seeking ) its perverse interpretation : but no one knows its interpretation , but Allah ; but those who have a deep knowledge say : We believe in it ; everything is from our Lord .
Our Lord ! Let not our hearts turn away after Thou hast guided us .
And bestow on us of Thy mercy . Indeed , Thou art the unceasing Giver .
Our Lord ! surely Thou art the Gathering of people on a Day of which there is no doubt ; surely Allah never misses His appointment .
( As for ) those who disbelieve , neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them anything with Allah .
It is they who will be fuel for the fire .
After the manner of the people of Firon and those before them , they denied Our signs , so Allah seized them on account of their sins ; and Allah is severe in punishment .
Say to those who disbelieve , &quot; You will be defeated , and gathered into Hell what an evil resting place . &quot;
There was for you a sign in the two bands which met : one band fought in the way of Allah and the other disbelieved ; they saw with their own eyes twice as many , and Allah strengthens with His Sustainer whom He pleases ; and Allah wills , and Allah supports with His help whom He wills .
Surely in that is a lesson for those who have insight .
For the enjoyment of men is the pleasure of their desires for women , and children , and stored up gold and silver , and race horses , and cattle and fields ; this is the pleasure of the life of this world ; and with Allah is the best return .
Say : Shall I inform you of something better than that ?
For the righteous , with their Lord , are Gardens beneath which rivers flow , wherein they will abide forever , and pure wives , and pleasure from Allah .
And Allah is Seer of ( His ) slaves .
Those who say , &quot; Our Lord , indeed we have believed , so forgive us our sins and protect us from the punishment of the Fire . &quot;
&#91; They are &#93; patient and truthful , and devout and dispensers and those who ask forgiveness at dawn .
Allah bears witness that there is no god but He , and the angels , and those who know ( bear witness ) ; He provides justice .
There is no god but He , the Mighty , the Wise .
Indeed , the religion with Allah is Islam , and those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them , out of envy among themselves .
And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah , then indeed , Allah is swift in reckoning .
And if they dispute with thee , say : I have surrendered completely to Allah , and so have those who follow me .
And say to those who were given the Scripture and to those who are unlearned , &quot; Do you become Muslims ? &quot;
If they become Muslims , they are guided , but if they turn away , then your duty is only to preach ( the message ) .
And Allah is Seer of ( His ) slaves .
Lo ! those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah and slay the prophets without justification , and slay those who admonish righteousness , proclaim a painful doom .
They are the ones whose works are in vain in this world and in the Hereafter , and they have no helpers .
Have you not considered those who were given a portion of the Scripture , when they were invited to the Scripture of Allah that it may judge between them ?
Then a group of them turned away , and they turned away .
saying , &quot; The fire will never touch us , except for numbered days . &quot;
And that which they were devising deceived them in their faith .
But how will it be when We gather them for a Day in which there is no doubt ? And each soul will be recompensed for what it has earned , and they will not suffer injustice .
Say : O Allah , Master of the Kingdom ! Thou givest the kingdom to whomsoever Thou pleasest and takest away the kingdom from whomsoever Thou pleasest , and Thou glorifies whom Thou pleasest and abasement whom Thou pleasest .
In Your hand is good . You have power over all things .
You cause the night to pass into the day , and the day to pass into the night , and You raise the living out of the dead , and You raise the dead out of the living , and You give sustenance to whom You will without measure . &quot;
Let not the believers take the unbelievers for guardians rather than the believers , and whosoever does that , he shall not find any help from Allah except ye fear them .
And Allah warns you of Himself , and to Allah is the return .
Say : &apos; Whether you hide what is in your hearts or reveal it , God knows it . He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth ; and God is powerful over everything . &apos;
On that Day , every soul will find ready what good it has done ; and what evil it has done it will desire that there should be a long space between it and him .
And Allah warns you of Himself , and Allah is Kind to His servants .
Say : If you love Allah , then follow me ; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins ; surely Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
Say : Obey Allah and the Apostle ; but if they turn their backs , then surely Allah does not love the unbelievers .
Verily Allah chose Adam and Noah and the house of Abraham and the house of Imran above all the worlds .
one generation from the other , and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
Then the wife of Imran said , &quot; My Lord ! Indeed I vow to You what is in my womb to consecrate , so accept it from me ; indeed You are the Hearing One , the Knowing One . &quot;
And when she gave birth to her , she said : My Lord , I have given birth to her as a girl . And Allah knew of what she had given birth to ; and the male is not like the female .
&quot; And I have named her Mary , and I desire her and her offspring to seek shelter from Satan . &quot;
And so Allah accepted them graciously , and made them grow up in a beautiful manner under the care of Zacharias .
Whenever Zechariah entered upon her in the sanctuary , he found food with her , and said , &quot; O Mary , where did this come to you ? &quot;
She said , &quot; It is from Allah . Indeed , Allah gives provision to whom He wills . &quot;
Thereupon Zechariah prayed to his Lord , saying : My Lord , grant me from Yourself a good offspring ; You are the Hearer of Prayer .
And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the temple , saying : Surely Allah has promised to you , John , a confirmer of Allah &apos;s Word , a noble and a prophet from among the good .
He said : O my Lord ! shall there be a son to me when old age hath overtaken me and my wife is barren ?
He said : &quot; Thus does Allah what He wills . &quot;
He said , &quot; My Lord , show me a sign . &quot;
He said : Your sign is that you shall not speak to men for three days except by gestures , and remember your Lord often and glorify Him in the evening and in the morning .
And then the angels said : O Marium ! surely Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds .
O Mary , be devoted to your Lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow . &quot;
This is of the announcements of what is unseen which We reveal to you , and you were not with them when they cast their pens as to which of them should be the guardian of Mary , nor were you with them when they quarreled .
O Mary ! Allah announces to you a word from Him . His name is the Messiah , Jesus son of Mary , honoured in this world and the Hereafter , and of those who are near ( to Allah ) .
And he will speak to the people in the cradle and in adulthood , and he will be one of the righteous . &quot;
She said , &quot; My Lord , shall I have a son when no man has touched me ? &quot;
He said : Allah creates what He pleases ; when He has decreed a thing He only says to it : Be , and it is .
And He will teach him the Book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel ,
And he will send him to the Children of Israel ( saying ) : &quot; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord .
I will create for you out of clay the likeness of a bird , and I will breathe into it , and by the permission of Allah I will make it a bird , and I will heal and bring the dead to life , by Allah &apos;s leave .
Surely in that is a sign for you , if you are believers .
And I have come to you confirming the Torah before me and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you ; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord , so be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah and obey me .
Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord , therefore serve Him ; this is the right way .
And when Jesus perceived their disbelief , he said , &quot; Who is my helper to God ? &quot;
The disciples said : We are helpers ( in the cause ) of Allah ; we believe in Allah , and bear witness that we are devoted .
Our Lord ! We believe in that which Thou hast sent down , and we follow him .
So lead us down among the witnesses . &quot;
And they devised a plot , and Allah devised , and Allah is the best of planners .
O Jesus ! I will cause you to pass away and exalt you to Me , and I will deliver you from the unbelievers , and will raise you to rule over the unbelievers until the Day of Resurrection .
Then you will return to Me , and I will judge between you concerning that over which you were at variance .
As for those who disbelieve , I will punish them in this world and in the Hereafter , and they will have no helpers .
But as for those who believe and do righteous deeds , He will pay them in full their rewards , and Allah does not love the wrongdoers .
This is what We recite to you of the signs and the wise reminder .
Indeed , Jesus before Allah is like Adam ; He created him from dust ; then He said to him , &quot; Be , &quot; and he was .
( This is ) the truth from your Lord , so be not of the doubters .
And whoever argues with you about it after the knowledge has come to you , say , &quot; Come , let us call our sons and sons , and our wives , and your women , and our souls and your souls , and then let us pray to Allah and punish with curse of Allah ( the liars ) . &quot;
This is the story of truth : there is no god but God . He is the Almighty , the Wise .
And if they turn away , then Allah knows the wrongdoers .
Say : O People of the Book ! Come to a word common between us and you that we may worship Allah Allah , and that we may not associate anything with Him , and that some of us may not take others for lords besides Allah .
And if they turn away , then say , &quot; Bear witness that we are devoted &#91; to Him &#93; &quot; . &quot;
O People of the Scripture , why do you argue about Abraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him ? Do you not then understand ?
So you are arguing about something you know about , but why are you arguing about something you do not know about ?
Allah knoweth , and ye know not .
Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian ; but he was an upright man , a Muslim , and none of those who associate others with Allah .
Indeed the nearest of the people to Abraham are those who follow him , and this Prophet ( Muhammad ) and the believers ; and Allah is the Protector of the believers .
A party of the People of the Scripture would like to deceive you , but they deceive only themselves , and they know not .
O People of the Scripture , why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah while you witness &#91; them &#93; ?
O People of the Scripture , why do you confuse the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth against your knowledge ?
And then a party of the People of the Scripture said : Believe in that which is revealed unto the believers , and disbelieve at the end thereof , perhaps they will repent .
And believe not except those who follow your religion . &quot;
Say : Surely the ( true ) guidance is the guidance of Allah .
Say : &apos; Surely bounty is in the hand of Allah , He gives it to whomsoever He will .
And Allah is All @-@ Encompassing and Knowing .
He distinguishes with mercy whomever He wills , and Allah is full of Grace . &quot;
And among the People of the Book there are some who , if you entrust them with a heap of money , will give it to you ; and among them is he who , if you entrust them with a dinar , will not give it to you unless you follow after them .
That is because they say , &quot; We are under no obligation towards the unlearned . &quot; And they say a lie against Allah , and they know .
But whoever fulfills his duty and fears Allah , then indeed , Allah loves the righteous .
Verily those who sell their Allah &apos;s covenant and their oaths for a small price will have no portion in the Hereafter , and Allah will not speak unto them , nor will He look at them on the Day of Resurrection , nor will He purify them , and theirs will be a painful punishment .
And lo ! a party of them twist their tongue with the Scripture , that ye may consider it a part of the Scripture , while it is not in the Scripture , and they say : It is from Allah , but it is not from Allah , and they speak a lie against Allah while they know .
It is not permissible for a man to whom Allah has given the Book and the Wisdom and the Prophethood to say to the people : &quot; Be my servants with Allah . &quot; Rather : &quot; Be doctors of God with what you have taught and with what you have studied . &quot;
Nor does He command you to take the angels or the prophets for lords .
Would He command you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Him ?
And then Allah accepted the covenant from the prophets : &quot; If I give you the Book and Wisdom , then there will come to you a messenger confirming what you have ; surely you shall believe him and help him . &quot;
He said , &quot; Do you accept this and take the covenant on this condition ? &quot;
They said : &apos; We agree &apos; . He said : So bear witness , and I will be with you among the witnesses . &apos;
Whoever turns away after this , these are the transgressors .
Do they seek a religion other than the religion of Allah ?
All that is in the heavens and the earth submit to Him , obedient or unwillingly , and to Him they return .
Say : We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us , and what was revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes , and what was given to Musa and Isa and the prophets from their Lord ; we make no distinction between any of them , and to Him do we submit .
And whoever desires a religion other than Islam , it will not be accepted from him , and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers .
How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and after they had testified that the Messenger was truthful , and after clear proofs had come unto them ?
And Allah guides not the wrongdoers .
Their reward is that on them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of all mankind .
They will abide in it forever ; their punishment will not be lightened , nor will they be reprieved .
Except those who repent thereafter and do righteous deeds , for surely Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
But whosoever disbelieves after his belief , and more and more falls into disbelief , his repentance shall not be accepted . These are the ones who stray .
Indeed , those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - never will the earth full of gold be accepted from them , even if they wanted it as ransom .
They will suffer a painful torment and no one will help them .
Ye shall not attain kindness until ye spend of that which ye love ; and whatsoever ye spend , lo ! Allah knoweth .
All food was lawful for the Children of Israel , except what Israel forbade himself before the Torah was revealed .
Say , &quot; Then bring the Torah and read it , if you should be truthful . &quot;
And whoever forges a lie against Allah after that - then those are the wrongdoers .
Say : Allah speaketh the truth .
So follow the religion of Abraham , the upright in faith , and set no gods beside Allah .
Verily , the first House established for men is in Bakka a blessed and a guidance for the worlds .
In it are clear signs , the place of Abraham .
Whoever enters it is safe .
The duty of men to Allah is a journey to the house , who is able to make the way to it .
And whoever disbelieves , indeed , Allah is not in need of the worlds .
Say : O People of the Book ! why do you disbelieve in the communications of Allah while Allah is witness of what you do ?
Say : O People of the Book , why do you turn the believers from the way of God ? You seek to make it crooked , when you witness thereof .
But Allah is not unaware of what you do . &quot;
O you who believe ! If you obey a party of those who were given the Scripture , they will disbelieve you after your faith .
How can you disbelieve when the verses of Allah are recited to you and His Messenger is among you ?
And whoever holds fast to Allah , he is guided .
O ye who believe ! Fear Allah with due fear , and do not die except as Muslims .
And hold fast to God &apos;s cords together , and do not disintegrate ; remember God &apos;s blessing upon you when you were enemies , and He brought your hearts together , so that by His blessing you became brethren ; and you were on the brink of a pit of fire , and He saved you from it .
Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided .
And let there be from you a party who invite to good and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong , and they are the successful .
And do not be like those who are divided and divided , after the clear proofs have come to them ; and for them is a painful punishment .
On the day when faces turn white and faces turn black and as for those whose faces turn black : &quot; Have you disbelieved after your faith ? So you shall have a penalty because you disbelieved . &quot;
And as for those whose faces will become white , they shall be in the mercy of Allah , and therein they shall abide .
These are the Signs of Allah : We recount them to thee in truth : Allah wills no injustice to the worlds .
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth , and to Allah is the return of all things .
You are the best nation ever brought forth for men ; you command what is right , and forbid what is wrong , and you believe in Allah .
And if the People of the Scripture had believed , it would have been good for them ; among them are believers , but most of them are defiantly disobedient .
They will not harm you except for a little harm , and if they fight you , they will turn their backs on you , as if they will not be victorious .
Abasement is prescribed for them , wherever they are hit , unless they are safe ( because of ) their bond with Allah or people .
They have incurred the wrath of Allah , and poverty is prescribed for them , because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and murdered the prophets unjustly , because they were rebellious and disobeyed and were transgressors .
But they are not all the same .
Among the People of the Scripture is a community that always recites the verses of Allah at the time of the night , prostrating and prostrating &#91; in prayer &#93; .
Those believe in Allah and the Last Day , and enjoin what is right , and forbid what is wrong , and vie with righteous deeds . These are among the righteous .
Whatever good they do , it shall not be denied them ; and Allah knows those who guard ( against evil ) .
As for those who disbelieve , their riches and their children will not avail them in the least against God ; those are the Companions of the Fire , therein they shall abide forever .
The parable of what they spend in this worldly life is that of a cold wind that strikes the field of men who sin against themselves .
So he destroyed him ; and God was not unjust to them , but they were unjust themselves .
O you who believe ! Take not friendship except with others like yourselves .
They will not fail to destroy you , and they will wish for your ruin .
Hatred has already appeared from their mouths , but what they conceal within themselves is worse .
Now We have made clear to you the signs , if you understand .
Look !
It is you who love them , but they do not love you , and you believe in the entire Book .
And when they meet you , they say : We believe ; but when they are alone , they bite their fingers in rage at you .
Say : &quot; Dire in your rage . &quot;
Lo ! Allah knoweth what is in your hearts .
If good befalls you , they consider it evil ; and if an evil afflicts you , they rejoice in it ; but if you are patient and guard ( against evil ) , their guile will not harm you . Lo ! Allah comprehends what they do .
And then you forsook your family in the morning to instruct the believers in the positions of warfare ; and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
So two groups of you almost lost heart , and Allah was the Protector of both , and on Allah the believers shall rely .
And then Allah helped you in Badr , while you were despised ; be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah , that you may be thankful .
When thou saidst to the believers : Is it not enough for you that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels sent down ?
If you are patient and pious and they come upon you immediately your Lord will help you with five thousand angels ready for battle . &quot;
And this Allah made for you only as good tidings , and that your hearts may rest , for the victory is only from Allah , the Mighty , the Mighty , the Wise .
That He may cut off a part of the Unbelievers or subdue them , so that they may return disappointed .
It is not for you to decide whether He will turn to them forgive them or punish them , for they are the evildoers .
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills . And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful .
O you who believe ! do not devour usury , making it double in number , but be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah , that you may be successful .
And fear the Fire , which is prepared for the disbelievers .
and obey God and the Messenger , so that you may be shown mercy .
And strive for the forgiveness of your Lord and for a garden as wide as heaven and earth , prepared for those who guard ( against evil ) .
Those who spend ( in ) joy and in sorrow and suppress ression and forgive mankind , and Allah loves the righteous .
And those who , when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves , remember Allah and ask forgiveness of their sins ; and who forgiveth sins save Allah , and those who do not persist in what they do knowingly ?
For them their reward is forgiveness from their Lord , and Gardens beneath which rivers flow ; therein they shall be forever ; and the reward of the performers is great .
Many ways of life have been before you ; so travel the earth , and see what was the end of those who denied ( the Truth ) .
This is a proclamation to the people , and a guidance for the righteous .
And do not despair and grieve ; you will be victorious if you are believers .
If a hardship has hit you , a hardship has already hit other people immediately .
These days We alternate between the people , that God may know the believers , and choose witnesses from among you ; and God does not love the unjust .
And that Allah may purify the believers and destroy the disbelievers .
Or do you think that Allah will not know those among you who have fought ( in battle ) and He will not know those who are patient ?
You were longing for death before you met it ; now you have seen it with your own eyes .
Muhammad is not but a messenger ; before him the messengers have passed away before him .
And if he dies or is killed , will you turn back on your heels ?
And whoever turns back on his heels does not harm Allah at all , but Allah will reward the grateful .
No one will die without the permission of God . This is an appointed time for all .
And whoever desires the reward of the world , We will give him thereof ; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter , We will give him thereof ; surely We will reward the grateful .
Many were the Prophets who fought against ( an enemy ) , followed by many righteous , but they were not discouraged in the way of Allah , nor did they weaken , nor did they abase themselves ; and Allah loves the patient .
And their word was not but that they said : &quot; Our Lord , forgive us our sins and our sins , and make our steps firm , and help us against the disbelieving people . &quot;
And Allah gave them the reward of this world and the best reward of the hereafter , and Allah loves the doers of good .
O you who believe ! If you obey the unbelievers , they will turn you back on your heels , and you will be the losers .
But Allah is your Protector , and He is the best of helpers .
We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve , because they set up with Allah gods which He has not sent any authority , and their abode is the fire , and evil is the abode of the unjust .
And Allah had already fulfilled His promise to you when you destroyed them by His permission , until you became despondent and contentious and disobedient about the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you desired .
Some of you longed for this world and others longed for the Hereafter .
Then He turned you away from them that He might try you ; and He has now forgiven you .
And Allah is full of bounty for the believers .
When you were going up , and paid no heed to anyone , and the Messenger was calling you from behind ; so He rewarded you with grief upon sorrow , that you might not grieve for what escaped you , and for what you suffered ; and Allah knows what you do .
Then , after grief , He sent down security upon you . Tiredness overtook a party of you , while another party was concerned with itself ; they think unjustly of Allah in pagan thought .
They said , &quot; Have we anything to do with this ? &quot;
Say : &quot; Indeed , the matter is &#91; entirely &#93; in the hands of Allah . &quot;
They concealed within themselves what they would not reveal to you , saying , &quot; If we had any part of the matter , we would not have been killed here . &quot;
Say thou : Had ye been in your houses , verily those to whom death was ordained in their resting places would have gone forth that Allah might prove that which is in your hearts , and search out that which is in your hearts ; and Allah is Knower of that which is in the breasts .
Lo ! those of you who turned their backs on the day when the two hosts met , only Satan had made them stumble because of some of their deeds .
But Allah has pardoned them . Indeed , Allah is Forgiving and Forgiving .
O ye who believe ! Be not like the Unbelievers who say of their brethren when they walked in the land or when they were contenders : If they had stayed with us , they would not have died or been slain .
God has decreed this to be a sorrow for their hearts .
And Allah gives life and causes death , and Allah is the Seer of what you do .
If ye are slain in the way of Allah , or die , verily Allah &apos;s forgiveness and mercy is better than that which ye gather .
And if you die or are slain , you will be gathered together before Allah .
And , by the mercy of Allah , you were kind to them ; but if you had been harsh and hard @-@ hearted , they would have gone away from thee .
So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter ; and when you are resolved , put your trust in Allah ; surely Allah loves those who put their trust in Him .
If Allah helps you , none can overcome you ; but if He forsakes you , who is there who can help you but Him ?
And in Allah let the believers put their trust .
It is not for a Prophet to embezzle , and whosoever embezzled shall bring that which he embezzled on the Day of Resurrection ; then every soul shall be recompensed according to its merit , and they shall not be wronged .
So is he who sought the pleasure of Allah like he who has incurred the wrath of Allah and whose abode is hell , and it is an evil end ?
They are in different ranks with Allah , and Allah sees what they do .
Surely Allah was gracious to the believers when He raised up from among them a Messenger from among them to recite to them His verses , to purify them , and to teach them the Book and the Wisdom , for behold they were in manifest error .
And when a calamity befell you , after you had attained to twice as much , you began to say : Where is this ?
Say : It is from yourselves .
Lo ! Allah is Able to do all things .
What befell you on the day when the two armies met was by Allah &apos;s leave , and that He may know the believers .
and that He might know the hypocrites ; and it was said to them , Come up , fight in God &apos;s way , or defend yourselves ; but they said : If we had known how to fight , surely we would have followed you . They were on that day closer to disbelief than to belief ; they said with their mouths that which was not in their hearts ; and Allah is well aware of what they conceal .
Those who said to their brothers while they were at home , &quot; Had they obeyed us , they would not have been slain &quot; ; say : So avert death from yourselves , if you are truthful .
Do not consider those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead , while they are alive with their Lord , and they are provided for .
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His Bounty , and rejoicing in those who have not yet followed them , so that no fear shall come upon them , nor shall they grieve .
They rejoice in the grace of Allah and His bounty , and that Allah wasteth not the reward of the believers .
As for those who answered God and the Messenger after they had been defeated , those of them who did good deeds and feared God shall have a great reward .
Those to whom the people said , &apos; Behold , the people have gathered against you , and fear them &apos; , but they grew stronger in faith , and they said , &apos; God is sufficient for us and He is the best of lawyers . &apos;
So they returned with Allah &apos; s grace and grace , untouched by evil ; and they followed the pleasure of Allah ; and Allah is Full of Grace .
That Satan wants only to frighten his helpers , but do not fear them , but fear Me , if you are believers .
And do not be grieved by those who rush after disbelief ; they cannot harm Allah at all ; Allah does not want to give them any portion in the Hereafter , and for them is a great punishment .
Those who do not sell faith in exchange for disbelief can never harm Allah , and for them will be a painful punishment .
And let not those who disbelieve think that what We grant them respite is good for them ; We give them only long life that they may grow in sin , and for them is a shameful punishment .
Allah will not leave the believers in the condition in which you are until He has separated the bad from the good .
And Allah does not intend to reveal to you that which is unseen , but Allah chooses from His apostles whom He pleases ; so believe in Allah and His apostles ; and if you believe and guard ( against evil ) , then you shall have a great reward .
And let not those who covetously withhold of that which Allah hath given them of His bounty think that it is better for them .
Nay , it will be evil for them ; and they will be collared with what they were greedy on the Day of Resurrection .
And to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth , and Allah knows your deeds .
God has heard the words of those who said , Surely Allah is poor and we are rich .
We wish to write down their words and their unjust killing of the prophets and say , &quot; Taste the punishment of burning .
That is for what your hands have sent before , and Allah is not unjust to the servants
Those who say : &quot; Allah has made us not to believe any of the Messengers before he brings to us an offering consumed by fire . Say : &quot; Messengers came to you before me with clear signs , and with what you spoke of ; why then did you slay them , if you are true ? &quot;
And if they deny you , &#91; O Muhammad &#93; - indeed , messengers were before you , and they came with clear proofs and scriptures and an enlightening Scripture .
Every soul shall taste of death , and you shall have your reward in full on the Day of Resurrection ; and whoever is kept from the fire and led to Paradise shall be happy .
The life of this world is nothing but an illusory enjoyment .
You shall surely be tried in your possessions and yourselves , and you shall hear from those who were given the Book before you , and from those who associate others with Allah .
But if you are patient and fear Allah , indeed , that is of the matters of determination .
And when Allah made a covenant with those who were given the Book ( saying : ) &quot; make it known to the people and hide it not , &quot; they threw it over their shoulders and sold it for a very small price ; and evil is that which they buy .
Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done , and desire to be praised for what they have not done , escape the punishment ; to them shall be a painful punishment .
And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth , and Allah has power over all things .
Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth , and in the alternation of the night and the day , there are signs for those with understanding .
Those who remember Allah while standing , sitting , and &#91; lying &#93; on their sides , and reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth , &#91; saying &#93; , &quot; Our Lord , You did not create this in vain .
Glory be to You , so guard us against the punishment of the Fire .
Our Lord ! Whomsoever Thou causest to enter the Fire , him Thou bringest to abasement , and there shall be no helpers for the unjust .
Our Lord , indeed we have heard a caller calling to faith , &quot; Believe in your Lord , &quot; and we have believed .
Our Lord , forgive us our sins , and erase from us our misdeeds , and let us die with the righteous .
&quot; Our Lord ! give us what You promised to us through Your Messengers , and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection . You never break ( Your ) promise . &quot;
And their Lord answered them , and I do not waste the work of any worker among you , whether male or female ; each of you is from the other .
And those who emigrated , and were expelled from their homes , and those who suffered on My way and fought and fell , I will surely blot out their iniquities , and I will surely bring them into gardens through which rivers flow , as a reward from Allah . And with Allah is the best reward .
Do not be deceived by the conduct of the unbelievers in the countries .
There is only a tiny usage then , and their refuge is Gahannam , and the camp is bad !
But whoever fears his Lord - for him are gardens beneath which rivers flow ; they will abide therein eternally , an entertainment from Allah , and what is with Allah is best for the righteous .
And most surely of the People of the Book there are those who believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to them , being lowly to Allah , and they do not sell His communications for a small price .
These will have their reward with their Lord ; surely Allah is swift in reckoning .
O you who believe ! Be patient , and be patient , and be patient , and fear Allah ; perhaps you will succeed .
O mankind ! Fear your Lord , Who created you from a single soul , and created from it its mate , and from them He created many men and women .
Fear God , in Whose name you ask one another , as well as the blood relatives .
Verily Allah is watching over you .
And give to the orphans their property , and do not exchange ( your ) bad things for ( their ) good , and consume not their property with your property ; surely that is a great crime .
And if ye fear that ye shall not be justly with the orphans , marry that which seemeth good to you of women , two , three , four ; and if ye fear that ye shall not be equitable , marry one ( of them ) , or ( marry ) that which is in your right hands .
This will make it more likely that you will avoid injustice .
And give the women their bridal gift as a gift and if they are pleased to give you some of it , you can certainly consume it for pleasure .
And give not unto the foolish your property which Allah hath assigned unto you as support , but feed and clothe them therefrom , and speak unto them kindly .
And test the orphans until they attain the age of marriage ; and if you perceive in them good sense , then hand over their property to them ; and do not consume them extravagantly and hastily before they grow up .
And whoever is rich must abstain from it , and whoever is poor , let him consume with fairness .
And when you hand over their property to them , bear witness in their presence ; it is sufficient that Allah takes account .
To the men a share of the legacy of their parents and relatives belongs to the women a share of the legacy of their parents and relatives , and also to the women .
Whether it is a little , or much , a prescribed proportion .
And when the relatives and orphans and the orphans and the needy are present at division , give them something of it and speak to them in kind words .
Those who are afraid for them if they leave weak children , let them be afraid of Allah , and let them speak words of justice .
Lo ! those who unjustly devour the wealth of orphans , they will eat up fire in their bellies , and they will burn up in the Blaze .
Allah prescribes for you concerning your children : for the male , the like of the two of the females .
But if there are more than two women , they shall have two @-@ thirds of the inheritance ; if there is only one , she shall have half the inheritance .
For every parent a sixth share of the inheritance is due if the deceased has children ; if no children , and the parents are the heirs to him , then the mother has a third ; if the deceased has brothers or sisters , the mother has a sixth share after any bequest or debt has been paid , or any debt .
You do not know which of them , your parents and your children , are nearest to you in benefit .
This is a commandment from Allah ; surely Allah is Knowing , Wise .
And you receive a half of what your wives leave if they have no children ; but if they have children , then you receive a fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may bequeath , or any debt . And to them is a fourth of what you inherit if you have no children ; and if you have children , they receive an eighth of what you inherit after any bequest or debt you may have .
If a man or woman have no parents or children , but have a brother or a sister , they shall each inherit one @-@ sixth of the inheritance .
If there are more siblings , they shall divide up a third of the inheritance of any bequest or debt . This is a commandment from God . Allah is Knowing , Gentle .
These are the limits of Allah ; and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger , He introduces him to gardens beneath which rivers flow , wherein they shall abide eternally ; and that is the great bliss .
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits , He will bring him into the Fire to abide therein , and he will have a humiliating punishment .
And if any of your women are guilty of lewdness , call in four witnesses from among you against them , and if they witness against them , then shut them up in their houses until death overtakes them or Allah gives them a way out .
If two of you commit it , then do them harm .
But if they repent and mend ( their ways ) , leave them alone ; for Allah is Oft @-@ Gracious , Most Merciful .
Only those who do evil in ignorance , and who do evil in time thereafter , are to be forgiven by Allah , to whom Allah will turn ( mercifully ) , and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
But those who do wrong do not expect forgiveness and those who , when death comes to them , say , &quot; Now I turn back . &quot; Nor do those who die while they are unbelievers .
For them We have prepared a painful punishment .
O ye who believe ! It is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will , nor should ye hinder them in order that they may take away some of that which ye have given them , unless they have manifestly committed fornication .
Live with them honorably , and if you dislike them , it may be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed much wealth .
And if you wish to exchange a wife for another , and you have given one of them a gift , take nothing from him .
Would you take it away in slander and manifest sin ?
How can you take it away , when you have already lived with one another , and they have made a firm covenant with you ?
And do not marry the women whom your fathers married , except what has already occurred ; indeed it is shameful and hateful , and an evil way .
Forbidden unto you are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters and your father &apos;s sisters and your mother &apos;s sisters and your brother &apos;s daughters and your sister &apos;s daughters and your nursing mothers who have breastfed you and your milk sisters and the mothers of your wives and your step @-@ daughters who are under your protection and your wives with whom you have carried out ( the marriage ) , but if ye have not done it with them , it is no sin .
And ( also ) the wives of your sons , the offspring of you , and you shall not have two sisters together unless it has already been done . Lo ! Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And ( forbidden to you ) are married women , except those whom your right hands possess .
This is the decree of God for you .
And it is lawful for you ( to ) covet women with your money for marriage , not for fornication .
And to those whom you have enjoyed , give them their gift .
This is a precept , but it shall not be a sin if you make an agreement with one another beyond the precept .
Lo ! Allah is Knower , Wise .
And whoever among you cannot afford to marry believing women , let him marry among your believing handmaids from your right hands , and Allah knows your faith . You are one of another .
So marry them with their families &quot; permission , and give them their bridal gift according to equity , if they are chaste , neither commit fornication , nor secretly take lovers .
And if they are guilty of fornication after they have been married , they shall suffer half the punishment prescribed for free women .
This &#91; relief &#93; is for those of you who fear distress .
It is better for you to be patient , and Allah is Oft @-@ forgiving , All @-@ merciful .
Allah wishes to explain to you the ways of those who were before you , and to guide you , and to turn to you in mercy , and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
And Allah wants to turn to you in mercy ; and those who follow the lusts desire that you should deviate from the right way .
Allah wishes to lighten your burden , for man was created weak .
O you who believe ! do not deprive one another of your wealth deceitfully , but it is different if it is a business which you do by a mutual agreement , and do not kill one another ; Allah is Merciful to you .
If anyone does that through transgression and injustice , We shall burn him in the Fire , and that is easy for God .
If you avoid the worst of what you are forbidden , We will remove from you your lesser evil , and We will bring you to a noble place .
And do not covet that by which Allah has made some of you excel others .
Let men receive their share of what they earn , and let women receive their share of what they earn .
And ask Allah for His bounty .
Lo ! Allah is Knower of all things .
And for each , We have appointed heirs to what parents and near relatives leave behind , as well as those with whom you have made an agreement .
So give them their portion ; surely God is witness of everything .
Men are the ones in charge of women because Allah has made one of them to excel the other , and because they spend out of their wealth .
Therefore , the women who are virtuous , and those who keep ( their husbands ) secrets with help of Allah .
As for those of whom you fear rebellion , admonish them , avoid them in the bed of marriage , and beat them .
Then if they obey you , look not for any excuse against them .
Lo ! Allah is Exalted and Great .
And if you fear a breach between the two , then send an arbiter from his family and an arbiter from her family .
If they wish to reconcile , God will bring them peace ; surely Allah is Knowing , Knowing .
Worship Allah , and ascribe no partner to Him , and be good to parents , and to relatives , and orphans , and the needy , and the neighbor , and the relative , and the stranger , the companion , and the traveller , and the slave whom you possess .
Lo ! Allah loveth not the proud , the boastful ,
Those who are niggardly , and enjoin the people to be niggardly , and hide that which Allah hath bestowed upon them in His grace , and We have prepared for the unbelievers a shameful punishment .
And those who spend their wealth to be seen by people , and do not believe in Allah and the Last Day ; and whoever has Satan as a companion , he has an evil neighbor .
But what would it have done them if they believed in Allah and the Last Day , and spent out of what Allah has given them ?
And Allah knows them .
Lo ! Allah wrongeth not even of an atom &apos;s weight , and if any deed is a good deed , He multiplieth it and giveth from Himself a mighty reward .
How will it be then , when We bring from every nation a witness , and bring thee ( O Muhammad ) as a witness against these ?
On that Day , those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth should be levelled above them , and they will not be able to hide anything from Allah .
O you who believe ! Do not approach prayer when you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying , nor when you are unclean , except when you are travelling on the road , until you have washed yourselves .
And if you are sick or on a journey , or any of you comes from the need , or you have touched women , and you cannot find water , then seek clean sand and wipe your faces and your hands . Lo ! Allah is Pardoning , Forgiving .
Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Scripture has been given , purchasing error &#91; in exchange for it &#93; and wishing you would stray from the way .
And Allah is most knowing of your enemies ; and sufficient is Allah as a protector , and sufficient is Allah as a helper .
Among the Jews there are some who distort words from their positions , saying , &quot; We hear , and we will not obey , &quot; and &quot; Hear without being heard , &quot; and &quot; Be indulgent to us , &quot; lying with their tongues and blaspheming faith .
And if they had said : &quot; We hear and we obey &quot; , and &quot; Hear &quot; , and &quot; Look upon us graciously , &quot; it would have been better for them and more upright .
But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief , so they do not believe except a little .
O you who have been given the Book ! Believe in what We have sent down confirming what is before you , before We destroy some faces and cast them on their backs , or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath @-@ breakers ; and Allah &apos;s command is certainly carried out .
Allah forgiveth not ( the sin of ) joining other gods with Him ; but He forgiveth what is less than that to whom He will .
And whoever ascribes partners to Allah , he has indeed sinned a great sin .
Have you not seen those who purify themselves ?
But it is Allah who purifies whom He wills , and they will not be wronged .
See how they fabricate lies against Allah , and this is sufficient as a manifest sin .
Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book has been given ? They believe in magic and idols and they say of the unbelievers that they are better guided than those who believe .
Those are they whom Allah has cursed ; and for him whom Allah curses , you will not find a helper .
Or do they have a share in the dominion ?
Then they would not give the people even as much as the groove of a date seed .
Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them out of His bounty ?
Then We certainly gave to the house of Abraham the Book and Wisdom , and We had given them a great kingdom .
And some of them believed in it , and some of them turned away from it ; and hell is evil enough as a fire .
And ( as for ) those who disbelieve in Our communications , We will burn them with fire ; so often as their skins are burned , We shall change them for other skins that they may taste the chastisement ; surely Allah is Mighty , Wise .
But as for those who believe and do righteous deeds , We will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow , wherein they will abide eternally , and there they shall have pure wives , and We will admit them to a place of charity with ample shade .
Allah commands you to give back to their owners the goods entrusted to you , and to judge with justice between men .
Verily , equitable is the cause of which Allah reminds you . Allah is Hearing , Seeing .
O you who believe ! obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those in authority among you ; and if you dispute about anything , refer it to Allah and the Apostle if you believe in Allah and the Last Day .
That is the best and is the most likely outcome .
Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you ? They desire to be judged by the Shaitan , when they were commanded not to believe in it , and Satan desires to lead them astray .
And when it is said unto them : Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and unto the messenger , thou seest the hypocrites turning away from thee in aversion .
But how will it be when an affliction strikes them because of the former deeds of their hands ? They come to you , swearing by Allah , &quot; We desired nothing but to set things right and to set things right between them . &quot;
These are they of whom Allah knoweth that which is in their hearts .
So turn away from them and admonish them , and speak to them concerning themselves a strong word .
And We did not send a Messenger except that he was obeyed by permission of Allah .
And if they had come to you , after they had wronged themselves , and they had asked forgiveness of Allah , and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them , they would have surely found Allah Forgiving , Merciful .
But no , by your Lord , they will not be believers until they make you a judge of what is in dispute between them , and then they will not find in their hearts any reticence against your decision , and will surrender to Him in full submission .
Had We prescribed for them : &apos; Slay yourselves &apos; or &apos; Leave your houses &apos; they would not have done it , except a few of them . But if they had done what they had been asked to do , for them , it would have been better for them , and strengthening .
Then We would surely have given them from Us a great reward .
And We would certainly have guided them to the Straight Path .
Whosoever obeys God and the Messenger , let him be with those whom God has bestowed His bounty , and with the prophets , and the truthful , and the witnesses , and the righteous , what good companions !
That is a mercy from Allah , and Allah suffices as Knower .
O ye who believe ! Take your precautions , and then either go out in a troop or go all together .
Among you is he who remains behind , and if an affliction strikes you , he says : Surely Allah has been gracious to me that I was not present with them .
But if a bounty from God is given to you , he will say , as if there were no friendship between you and him : &quot; If I had been with them , I would have achieved great success . &quot;
Therefore let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the price of the afterlife .
And whoever fights in the cause of Allah , then is killed or overcomes , We will give him a great reward .
And why should you not fight in the cause of Allah and for the weak , men , women , and children , who say : Our Lord ! bring us out of this city whose people are oppressors , and give us from Thee a guardian , and give us from Thee a helper ?
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah , and those who disbelieve fight in the way of the devil ; therefore fight against the followers of Satan .
Lo ! the devil &apos;s deceit is weak .
Have you not seen those to whom it was said : &apos; Restrain your hands , establish prayer , and pay Zakah &apos; ?
But when fighting was ordained for them , a party of them feared men as if fearing Allah , or even more , and they said : O Our Lord , why have You ordained fighting for us ?
Would you not give us respite for a little while ? &quot;
Say : The enjoyment of this world is little , and the hereafter is better for those who guard ( against evil ) , and you shall not be dealt with unjustly in the least .
Wherever you may be , death will overtake you , even if you should be in lofty castles .
And if good befalls them , they say : This is from Allah ; and if evil befalls them , they say : This is from you .
Say : All is from Allah .
Why , then , do they not understand a great deal of what they are told ?
Whatever good befalls you is from Allah , and whatever evil befalls you is from yourself .
And We have sent you ( O Muhammad ) to mankind as a Messenger , and Allah is sufficient as a witness .
Whoever obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah ; and whoever turns away , We have not sent you over them as a guardian .
They say , &apos; Obedience &apos; ; but when they leave thee , a party of them will say something other than what thou sayest , and Allah writes down what they say .
So turn away from them , and put your trust in God ; and Allah is sufficient guardian .
They do not think about the Quran .
Had it been from other than Allah , they would surely have found therein much inconsistency .
And when there comes to them something about security or fear , they make it known .
But if they had referred it to the Messenger , and to those of them in authority , those of them who could reveal it would have known it ; and had it not been for the grace and mercy of Allah on you , you would all have followed Shaitan ( Satan ) .
Therefore , fight in the way of Allah , you are not held responsible except for yourself , and encourage the believers in the fighting .
It may be that Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve , and Allah &apos;s power is greater and more severe in punishment .
Whoever intercedes for a good cause shall receive a share of it , and whoever intercedes for an evil cause shall receive a share of it ; and Allah has power over all things .
When you are greeted with a greeting , greet with a better greeting , or return it .
Verily Allah is Accountable of all things .
Allah , there is no god but He .
He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection , of which there is no doubt ; and who is more truthful than Allah in the matter ?
What is it with you that you are divided into two parties in the matter of hypocrites ?
And Allah has turned them away from what they did .
Do you want to guide those whom Allah has caused to go astray ?
And whomsoever Allah sendeth astray , for him thou shalt not find a way .
They wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve , so that you may all be equal .
Therefore , do not take from them protectors until they walk in the way of Allah .
And if they turn away , seize them and kill them wherever you can find them , and do not take from among them any protector or helper
Except those who join a people with whom you have a treaty , and those who come to you with their hearts restraining from fighting you or their own people .
And if Allah had willed , He could have given them power over you , and then they would have fought against you .
Therefore , if they keep away from you and do not fight you , and offer you peace , then Allah has not given you any cause against them .
You will find others who wish to be safe from you , and from their people . As often as they are led back to hostility , they are plunged into it .
So if they do not keep away from you , nor offer you peace , nor restrain their hands , seize them and kill them wherever you find them .
Against these , We have given you a full authority .
It is not for a believer to kill another believer except by mistake ; and whoever kills a believer by mistake , he should free a believing slave , and pay bloodmoney to his heirs , unless they remit it as charity .
But if he was of a people who are your enemy , and he who killed him is a believer , then let him deliver a believing slave ; but if he was of a people with whom you have a covenant , let him pay the price of blood to his heirs , and let him free a believing slave .
Anyone who is unable to fast must fast for two consecutive months ; this is the forgiveness of Allah ; and Allah is All Knowing , Wise .
And whoever kills a believer intentionally , his recompense is Hell to abide therein , and Allah will be wroth with him and will turn him away and prepare for him a great punishment .
O you who believe ! When you go forth in the way of Allah , make a proper study , and do not say to anyone who offers you the greeting of peace : You are not a believer .
Ye seek the good things of the life of the world , but Allah is with abundant bounty .
That is how ye used to be ; then Allah bestowed His grace on you . So make proper enquiries .
Verily , Allah is well acquainted with what you do .
Not equal are those among the believers who remain at home except the infirm and those who spend their wealth and their blood in the cause of Allah . Lo !
Allah has exalted in rank those who strive with their wealth and their blood over those who stay behind .
But to each one Allah has promised good , and Allah has rewarded those who fight with great reward before those who remain .
Degrees from Him and forgiveness and mercy ; and Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And the angels , when they recall them , will say to those who have done wrong to themselves , &quot; What was it you were in ? &quot;
They reply , &quot; We were treated as weak in the land . &quot;
Then they say : Was the earth of Allah not wide enough for you for you that you could have migrated therein ?
They are the ones whose abode will be Hell , and evil is the end !
Except for the oppressed , men , women and children , who have no opportunity and no way out .
These are they for whom Allah will forgive . Allah is Forgiving , Forgiving .
And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find in the earth sufficient refuge and abundance .
And whoever leaves his home and emigrates to Allah and His Messenger and then is overtaken by death , Allah provides for his reward . And Allah is Oft @-@ Forgiving , Most Merciful .
And when you travel in the land , there is no sin on you if you shorten the prayer if you fear that the unbelievers may afflict you ; surely the unbelievers are your open enemies .
And when you are among them and lead them in prayer , let a party of them stand with you , and let them carry their weapons .
And when they prostrate , let them come behind you , and let another party who have not prayed pray with you , and let them be on their guard and carry their weapons ; the unbelievers love that you should neglect your arms and your baggage so that they might attack you at once .
And there is no blame on you if you put aside your arms if you are suffering from rain or are ill , but be on your guard .
Indeed , Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment .
And when ye have established the prayer , remember Allah , standing and sitting and reclining .
Then , when ye are secure , establish the prayer , verily the prayer is a duty upon the believers .
And do not slacken in the pursuit of the disbelievers .
If you are suffering , they are suffering as you are suffering .
But you expect from Allah what they do not expect .
And Allah is Knowing , Wise .
Indeed We have sent down to you the Book with the truth , so that you may judge between the people by what Allah has shown you ; so do not be an advocate for the traitors .
And ask forgiveness of Allah ; surely Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
And do not plead for those who deceive themselves ; surely Allah does not love him who is a cheater and sinner .
They seek to hide from men , but they cannot hide from God ; and He is with them , when they prepare themselves for evil intrigues ; and Allah is Aware of what they do .
So you are pleading on their behalf in the present life ; but who will plead for them before Allah on the Day of Resurrection or who will be their protector ?
And whoever does evil or wrongs himself , and then asks forgiveness of Allah , will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful .
And whoever commits a sin , he commits it against himself ; and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
And whoever commits a mistake or a sin , then blames it on an innocent person , has a slander and an obvious sin .
And had it not been for the grace of Allah and mercy , a company of them would have decided to mislead you , but they lead themselves astray , and they cannot harm you in any way , and Allah hath sent down unto thee the Book and Wisdom , and taught thee that which thou knewest not , and Allah &apos;s grace upon thee hath been mighty .
There is no good in many of their conferences except in those which exhort charity or kindness or peacemaking between people .
And whoever does this seeking the pleasure of Allah , We will give him a great reward .
And whosoever opposeth the apostle after the right path hath become manifest unto him , and followeth other way than that of the believers , We shall cause him to pursue that which he followeth , and shall make him burn in Hell ; and evil is his end .
Allah forgiveth not ( the sin of ) joining other gods with Him ; but He forgiveth what is less than that to whom He will .
And whoever ascribes partners to Allah has indeed strayed into far error .
They invoke in His stead only females ; they invoke none but a rebellious Satan .
whom Allah has cursed , and who replied : &quot; I will take a portion of Your servants .
And I will lead them astray , and I will arouse their hopes , and command them to slit the ears of the cattle , and I will command them , and they will change the creation of Allah .
And whoever takes Satan as a guardian instead of Allah has certainly suffered a manifest loss .
He makes them promises to them and arouses desires in them , and Satan promises them what is delusion .
Those are the refuge of Gahannam and they shall find no escape from it .
And ( as for ) those who believe and do good , We will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow , to abide therein forever ( it is ) a true promise of Allah ; and who is more truthful than Allah ?
It will not be in accordance with your desires , nor the desires of the People of the Book ; whoever commits evil will be requited for it ; and he will not find for himself besides Allah any guardian or helper .
And those who do righteous deeds , be they male or female , believing - they will enter Paradise and will not be wronged in the least .
And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good and follows the religion of Abraham , the upright ?
And Allah took Abraham as a friend .
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth , and Allah encompasses all things .
And they ask you for instruction concerning women .
Say : Allah has instructed you concerning them , and what is recited to you in the Book concerns the orphan girls to whom you do not give what is prescribed for them , and whom you desire to marry , and the weak among the children , and that you should act with kindness for orphans .
Whatever good you do , God is aware of it . &quot;
And if a woman fears ill treatment from her husband or indifference , there is no sin for either of them if they make a reconciliation between themselves , and it is good .
The human being is attuned to greediness .
But if you do good and fear Allah , then indeed , Allah is Aware of what you do .
You will not be able to exercise justice among the women , however much you may desire it .
But do not incline completely &#91; toward one &#93; , leaving the other as if in suspense .
And if ye make amends and are righteous , then lo ! Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
But if they separate , Allah will suffice them both of His bounty , and Allah is Oft @-@ Endowed , Wise .
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth .
And We have enjoined upon those who were given the Scripture before you , and on you , that you should fear Allah .
But if ye disbelieve , lo ! unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth ; and Allah is not dependent on any and worthy of Praise .
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth , and Allah suffices as a Protector .
If He wills , He will take you away , O people , and bring others . And Allah is Exalted in Might .
Whoever desires the reward of this world , then with Allah is the reward of this world and the hereafter ; and Allah is Hearing , Seeing .
O ye who believe ! Be ye watchful in justice , and bear witness to Allah , even when it is against yourselves or against parents or your kindred .
Whether one is rich or poor , God is nearer to both of them ; so follow not the personal desire , that you may be fair ; and if you twist or turn away , God is aware of the things you do .
O ye who believe ! Believe in Allah and His messenger and the Scripture which He hath revealed unto His messenger , and in the Scripture which He revealed aforetime .
And whoever does not believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His apostles and the Last Day has certainly strayed into far error .
Those who believe , then disbelieve , then believe , then disbelieve , then increase in unbelief , God will not forgive them , neither will He guide them on the way .
Announce to the hypocrites that they shall have a painful punishment .
Those who take disbelievers for guardians of the believers ; do they seek from them power and honor ?
Lo ! to Allah belongs all majesty .
And certainly He has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear Allah &apos;s communications disbelieved in and mocked at , you sit not with them until they engage in some other conversation , or else you would be like them .
Surely Allah will gather the hypocrites and the unbelievers , all together in Hell .
Those who wait for news of you ; and when you are given a victory from Allah , they say : &quot; Were we not with you ? &quot;
But if the disbelievers have a share &#91; of success &#93; , they say , &quot; Did we not gain the upper hand over you and defend you from the believers ? &quot;
Then Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection , and Allah will never give the disbelievers over the believers .
Lo ! the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah , but He will trick them .
And when they stand up for prayer , they stand up unwillingly , to be seen by people and not to remember Allah save a little .
They are hesitant between these and those and do not get to them .
And whomsoever Allah guideth astray , for him thou shalt never find a way .
O you who have believed , do not take disbelievers as allies instead of believers .
Do you wish to give Allah a clear proof against yourselves ?
Surely the hypocrites shall be in the lowest depth of the Fire ; and you shall not find for them any helper ;
Except those who repent and amend and take refuge in Allah and turn their religion only to Allah , these are of the believers , and Allah will certainly give the believers a mighty reward .
What will Allah do with your punishment , if you are grateful and believe ?
And Allah is the Thankful , the Knower .
Allah loveth not the utterance of an evil word , except when injustice is done , and Allah is Hearing , Knowing .
If you do good , or keep it secret , or pardon an evil , then surely Allah is Pardoning , Powerful .
Lo ! those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers , and ( those who ) make a separation between Allah and His messengers and say : We believe in some and reject others , and wish to take an intermediate ( path ) ;
These , they are the unbelievers in truth , and We have prepared for the unbelievers a humiliating chastisement .
But those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction between any of them - to those He will repay their rewards , and Allah is Forgiving , Forgiving , Most Merciful .
The People of the Scripture ask you to bring down to them a Book from heaven .
But they asked of Moses something greater than this , saying , Show us Allah clearly .
Then the thunderbolt struck them for their wickedness .
Then they took the calf ( for worship ) after clear proofs ( of Allah ) had come to them , but We forgave .
And We gave Moses a clear authority .
And We raised the mountain above them on the occasion of their covenant , and We said to them , Enter by the gate into submission , and We said to them , Do not transgress the Sabbath commandment , and We made with them a strong covenant .
So when they broke their covenant and disbelieved in the signs of Allah , and they killed the prophets unlawfully and said , &quot; Our hearts are behind a veil , &quot; but no ; Allah has closed them because of their disbelief , so they believe little .
And because of their disbelief , and because of their assertion which they made against Mary with an enormous lie
And because of their saying , &quot; We killed the Messiah , Jesus , the son of Maryam , the Messenger of Allah &quot; ; they did not kill him nor crucify him , but this was only faked to them ; and those who disagree in this matter are most certainly in doubt in it ; they have no knowledge thereof , but they follow nothing but conjecture ; and they did not kill him .
Rather , Allah raised him up to Himself ; and Allah is Exalted in Might , Wise .
And there is none among the People of the Scripture who will not believe in it before his death , and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them .
We forbade them for the sin of the Jews good things which had been made lawful for them , and because they had placed many obstacles in the way of Allah .
And because of their taking usury , though they were forbidden , and their consuming of the wealth of the people unjustly .
And We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment .
But those among them who are profound in knowledge and those who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and those who keep up prayer and pay the Zakah , and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day , We will give them a great reward . We shall give them a great reward .
We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him , and We revealed to Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , the tribes , Jesus , Job , Jonah , Aaron , and Solomon , and We gave to David Zabur .
These are messengers of which We have already told you , and messengers of whom We have not related to you . And Allah spoke to Moses .
&#91; They are &#93; messengers and bearers of good news and warners , so that mankind will not have a argument against Allah after the messengers .
And Allah is Exalted in Might , Wise .
But Allah bears witness to what He has revealed to you that He has sent it with His knowledge , and the angels bear witness to it and Allah is sufficient as a witness .
Surely ( as for ) those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah &apos;s way , they surely have strayed into a great error .
As for those who disbelieve and have done wrong , Allah will not forgive them nor guide them to a way .
Except the path of hell , in which they will abide for ever ; and this is easy for Allah .
O mankind ! The Apostle has now come to you with the truth from your Lord , so believe , it is good for you ; and if you disbelieve , then to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth ; and Allah is Knowing , Wise .
O People of the Scripture , do not exaggerate in your religion , and say not of Allah except the truth .
The Messiah , Jesus , son of Mary , is only the Messenger of Allah and His Word which He has commanded Mary and of His Spirit .
So believe in Allah and His messengers , and say not : &quot; Three &quot; : desist , it is better for you .
Allah is but one God ; it is far from His glory to attribute a son to Him .
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth , and Allah is sufficient as Advocate .
The Messiah does not disdain to be a servant of Allah , nor do the angels who are near to Him ; and whoever disdains His worship and is exalted , He will gather them all together to Himself .
But as for those who believe and do good works , He will pay them in full their wages , and He will give them more out of His bounty ; and as for those who disdain and are proud , He will chastise them with a painful chastisement .
And they will not find for themselves besides Allah any guardian or helper .
O mankind ! There has certainly come to you a manifest proof from your Lord , and We have sent down to you a clear light .
As for those who believe in God , and hold fast to Him , He will admit them to His mercy and bounty , and He will guide them to Himself on a straight path .
They ask you for instruction .
Say : Allah teaches you concerning kinship : If a man dies and leaves no children , but has a sister , then she shall inherit half of his inheritance , and he shall inherit her if she has no children .
But if there are two sisters , they shall receive two @-@ thirds of what he leaves .
If they are both brothers and sisters , the number of a male will be that of two females . &quot;
Allah expoundeth unto you , lest ye err ; and Allah is Knower of all things .
O you who believe ! Fulfill the covenants .
Every kind of cattle except that which is revealed to you ( in the Scripture ) is permitted to you , not that you may consider hunting lawful while you go on pilgrimage ; surely Allah judges as He wills .
O you who believe ! Do not violate the practice of the Faith , for the glory of Allah , nor the sacred month nor the sacrificial animals nor the sacred animals , nor those seeking the sacred house seeking favor and pleasure from their Lord .
Once you have finished the consecration , you are free to hunt , but you are not to be moved by the hatred which you have against the people because they have turned you away from the sacred mosque so that you transgress .
And help one another in righteousness and piety , but do not help one another in sin and transgression .
And fear Allah , for Allah is strict in punishment .
Forbidden to you are that which is dead , and blood , and swine flesh , and that which is invoked other than the name of Allah ; that which is strangled ; that which hath been slain to death ; that which is fallen to death , or thrust to death , and that which predators have eaten , besides that which ye have slain ; and that which has been slain on a heathen sacrificial stone ; and ( that is forbidden to you ) that you seek by arrows to know the fate .
This is an outrage .
Today the unbelievers have resigned themselves to your faith ; so fear them not , but fear Me .
Today I have perfected your religion for you , completed My blessing upon you , and have chosen for you Islam as religion .
But whoever is compelled by hunger , with no inclination to sin , then indeed , Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
They ask you what is permitted for them .
Say : &quot; All good things are lawful for you , and what you have taught the beasts of prey , training them to hunt , and teaching them what Allah has taught you . So eat of what they catch for you , and utter the name of Allah concerning it .
Today all good things are lawful for you , and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you , as your food is lawful for them .
And honourable believing women and honourable women of the people who were given the Scripture before you , when you give them the bridal gift , and only for marriage and not for fornication and secret love .
And whoever disbelieves in the religion , his work has no doubt become vain , and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers .
O you who believe ! When you come to prayer , wash your faces and your hands to the elbows , and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles .
And if you are in a state of impurity , purify yourselves .
And if you are sick or on a journey , or any of you comes from the need , or you have touched women and find no water , seek clean sand , then rub your faces and hands with it .
Allah does not wish to put you in difficulty , but He intends to purify you and to complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful .
And remember the favor of Allah upon you and the covenant which He made with you when you said , &quot; We hear and we obey . &quot;
And fear Allah ; indeed , Allah knows what is hidden in the hearts .
Stand up for Allah and be witnesses of justice , and hatred of a group shall not lead you to do anything other than what is righteous .
Be just ; that is nearer to piety .
And fear Allah ; indeed , Allah is Acquainted with what you do .
Allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds forgiveness and a great reward .
And ( as for ) those who disbelieve and reject Our communications , these are the companions of the believers .
O you who believe ! Remember the favor of Allah upon you when a party sought to stretch out their hands against you .
But he withheld their hands from you , and fear Allah , and in Allah let the believers put their trust .
God made a covenant with the Children of Israel ; and We raised among them twelve chiefs .
And Allah said : verily I am with you , if ye establish prayer and give the zakah and believe in My apostles and support them and lend unto Allah a goodly loan , I shall surely expiate your iniquities and bring you into gardens beneath which rivers flow .
But whoever among you falls back into disbelief after that has gone astray from the right path .
Because of their breaking their covenant , We cursed them and hardened their hearts .
They pervert the Scripture in its rightful places , and they have forgotten a part of what they were reminded of .
And you will not stop discovering treachery on their side , except for some of them .
So pardon them and turn away from them ; surely Allah loves those who do good .
And with those who say , &quot; We are Christians , &quot; We made a covenant , but they have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded .
So We aroused enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection , and Allah will inform them of what they did .
O People of the Scripture ! Our Messenger has come to you , to reveal to you much of what you have concealed of the Scripture , and to forgive much .
Indeed , there has come to you from Allah a light and a clear Scripture .
Thus Allah guides to the ways of peace those who seek His good pleasure , and guides them from the shadows into the light by His leave , and guides them to a straight path .
They are unbelievers who say : &apos; Allah is the Messiah , son of Mary . &apos;
Say , &quot; Who then can do anything against Allah if He wants to destroy the Messiah , son of Mary , his mother , and those on earth ? &quot;
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them .
He creates what He wills , and Allah has power over all things .
And the Jews and the Christians said : We are the sons of Allah and His loved ones .
Say : Why then does He punish you for your sins ?
Nay , but ye are men of those whom He hath created .
He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He pleases ; and to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them , and to Him is the return .
O people of the Scripture ! Our Messenger has now come to you after a time between the Messengers to enlighten you , so that you may not say : No bearer of good news , nor a warner , has come to us .
And now there hath come unto you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner ; and Allah is over everything competent .
And ( then ) when Musa ( Moses ) said to his people : &quot; O my people ! Remember Allah &apos;s bounty to you , when He raised prophets from among you , made you kings , and gave you that which He had not given to any other among you in the world .
O my people ! Enter the holy land which Allah hath ordained for you , and turn not back , for then ye will turn back losers .
They said : O Musa ! verily , there is a people of tyranny , and we shall not enter it until they have forsaken it .
But if they leave it , then we will move in . &quot;
Said two men of those who feared , whom God had blessed , &quot; Enter the gate and turn against them ; when you enter , you shall be the victors .
And trust in God , if you are believers . &quot;
They said : O Musa ! verily we shall never enter it so long as they are in it .
Go thou with thy Lord , and fight , and we shall sit here .
He said : &quot; I have no power except over myself and my brother . So separate us from the people who are rebels . &quot;
He said : Certainly it shall not be forbidden to them for forty years ; they shall wander about in the earth .
And do not grieve over the defiant people . &quot;
And read to them in truth the story of the two sons of Adam , when they both offered an offering , and it was accepted from one of them and was not accepted from the other .
The latter said : &quot; I will surely kill you , &quot; and the latter said : &quot; Allah accepts only from those who are righteous .
If you stretch forth your hand against me to kill me , I will not stretch out my hand against you to kill you ; surely I fear Allah , the Lord of the worlds .
I would have you bear the burden of my sin and your sin , and be among the people of the Fire , and that is the reward of the wrongdoers . &quot;
But he was driven to kill his brother , so he killed him , and became one of the losers .
Then Allah sent a raven , scratching the earth , to show him how to hide his brother &apos;s body , saying : Woe to me !
Am I not even able to be like this raven , and to conceal my brother &apos;s dead body ? &quot; And he became contrite .
That is why We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever kills a man , without murdering him , or without mischief having been done in the land , he shall be as if he had killed all mankind ; and whosoever shall save a man , it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind .
And Our messengers came unto them with clear communications ; yet even after that , many of them committed riots in the land .
The punishment of those who wage war against God and His Messenger , and strive for corruption in the land is that they shall be killed or crucified , or have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides , or be expelled from the land .
For them is disgrace in this world , and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment .
Except for those who repent before you have them in your power ; so know that Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
O you who believe ! be careful of ( your duty to ) Allah , and seek the approach of Him , and fight in His way that you may prosper .
Verily those who disbelieve , if they had all that is in the earth , and therewith to ransom themselves therewith on the Day of Resurrection from the torment , it would not be accepted of them , and theirs shall be a painful punishment .
They will want to get out of the Fire , but they will not be able to escape it , and their punishment will be eternal .
As for the thief and the thief , cut off their hands as a punishment for what they have done , and a deterrent punishment from Allah . Allah is Mighty , Wise .
But whoever repents after his iniquity , and amends himself , Allah will accept repentance from him . Indeed , Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth ?
He punishes whom He pleases , and forgives whom He pleases ; and Allah has power over all things .
O Messenger , let not those grieve you who are hastily in disbelief , who say with their mouth : We believe , but disbelieve in their hearts .
And of the Jews are those who listen to falsehood , and they listen to others who have not come to you ; so they change the words from their places and say , &quot; If you are given this , accept it , but if you are not given it , beware . &quot;
And whomsoever Allah willeth to tempt , thou shalt not avail him against Allah at all .
Those are they whose hearts Allah would not purify ; for them is disgrace in this world , and in the Hereafter they shall have a great punishment .
They are notorious watchers of falsehood , devourers of the unlawful .
So if they come to you , judge between them or turn away from them .
And if you turn away from them , they cannot harm you in the least ; and if you judge , judge between them with justice ; surely Allah loves the just .
But how will they appoint you a judge , when they have the Torah in their possession , wherein is the judgement of Allah ?
Then , after that , they will turn their backs , and they will not be called believers .
Surely We revealed the Torah , wherein was guidance and light ; by it the prophets who had surrendered themselves ( to Allah ) justified the Jews , as did the rabbis and the scholars , for they were charged to preserve the Book of Allah , and they were its guardians .
So fear not men , but fear Me ; and give not My signs for a small price .
And whoever does not judge by that which Allah has revealed - those are the disbelievers .
And We prescribed for them therein : a life for a life , an eye for an eye , a nose for a nose , an ear for an ear , a tooth for a tooth , and for wounds retaliation ; but whosoever forgoes it , for him it shall be an expiation ; and whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed , these are the unjust .
We sent them following Jesus son of Mary , as confirmation of what was before him in the Torah , and We gave him the Gospel , wherein was guidance and light , and as confirmation of what was before him in the Torah , and as guidance and admonition for the righteous .
And let the people of the Gospel judge by that which Allah hath revealed therein , and those who judge not by that which Allah hath revealed are the transgressors .
And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth , confirming the Scripture that preceded it , and giving certainty concerning it . So judge between them by what Allah has revealed , and do not follow their inclinations to deviate from the truth that has come to you .
For each of you We have ordained a policy and a career .
Had Allah willed , He would have made you one community .
But He wanted to test you in what He has given you .
Therefore , race for good things .
To Allah will you all return , and He will inform you of that wherein you differed .
And that you judge between them according to what God has sent down , and do not follow their inclinations , and beware of them , lest they distress thee and drive thee away from a party of what Allah has revealed to thee .
And if they turn away , then know that Allah intends to afflict them for some of their sins ; and most surely most of the people are transgressors .
Do they want the guidelines of Gahiliya ?
And who is a better judge than Allah for a people who are firm &#91; in faith &#93; ?
O you who believe ! do not take the Jews and the Christians for guardians ; they are each other &apos;s guardians , and whoever of you takes them for guardians , he is surely of them ; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people .
And thou shalt see those in whose hearts is a disease , and they shall hasten to them , saying : We fear lest evil should befall us .
May Allah bring about victory or some event .
Then they will regret what they hide in their hearts .
The believers will say , &quot; Are these the ones who swore by God with their most solemn oaths that they would stand firm with you ? &quot;
Their works are in vain , and they are losers .
O you who believe ! Whoever from among you turns back from his faith , know Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him , humble towards the believers and harsh against the unbelievers ; they will fight in the way of Allah , and will not fear the reproach of the reprover .
That is the grace of Allah ; He grants it to whom He pleases ; and Allah is All @-@ Encompassing , All @-@ Knowing .
Your guardians are God , His Messenger , and the believers who perform the prayer , and pay the zakah and bow down in homage .
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and the believers as allies , then know that the party of Allah is the victorious .
O you who believe ! do not take those for guardians from those before you , and those who disbelieve , who mock and joke your religion , and fear Allah if you are believers .
And when you call to prayer , they make it a mockery and a joke ; this is because they are a people who do not understand .
Say : O People of the Book , indeed you are angry only because we believe in God , and in what has been sent down to us , and in what was sent down before , and because most of you are ungodly .
Say : Shall I inform you of those whose reward with Allah is worse than that ?
It is those whom Allah has cursed , and with whom He is angry , and of whom He has made apes and swine , and polytheists .
They are in a worse position and further astray from the right way . &quot;
And when they come to you , they say : We believe , but they enter with unbelief and go forth in it ; and Allah knows best what they conceal .
You see many of them competing with one another in sin and transgression , and in consuming forbidden things .
Evil indeed is what they have done .
Why do the rabbis and the scribes not forbid them of their sinful speech and consumption of what is unlawful ?
Evil indeed is that which they have been doing .
And the Jews say : The hand of Allah is chained .
May their hands be tied up , and may they be cursed for what they say .
Nay , but His hands are wide open ; He dispenses as He will .
And what has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief .
And We have placed among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection .
Whenever they kindle a fire of war , Allah extinguishes it , and they strive to do mischief in the land , and Allah does not love the mischievous .
If the People of the Scripture had believed and feared Allah , We would have removed from them their misdeeds , and We would surely have brought them into the Gardens of Bliss .
And if they had obeyed the Torah and the Gospel and that which hath been revealed unto them from their Lord , they would certainly find sustenance from above them and from beneath their feet , but many of them are a people who do evil .
O Messenger , deliver what has been sent down to you from your Lord , and if you do not , you have not delivered His message .
And Allah will protect you from the people ; surely Allah does not guide the unbelieving people .
Say : O People of the Book ! You are not on anything until you establish the Torah , the Gospel , and what is sent down to you from your Lord .
Surely what has been revealed to you from your Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and unbelief ; so do not grieve for the unbelievers .
Those who believe , and the Jews , and the Sabians , and the Christians , whoever believes in Allah and does good , they shall have no fear , nor shall they grieve .
Certainly We made a covenant with the Children of Israel and We sent to them apostles ; whenever there came to them an apostle with that which their souls did not desire , some of them they called liars and others they slew .
And they thought there would be no confusion , so they became blind and deaf .
Then Allah turned to them in mercy , and yet many of them became blind and deaf ; and Allah is Seeing what they do .
They are unbelievers who say : &apos; Allah is the Messiah , the son of Mary &apos; and the Messiah said : O Children of Israel , worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord .
Whoever associates others with Allah , Allah has forbidden him Paradise , and his refuge shall be the Fire , and the wrongdoers shall have no helpers .
Lo ! unbelievers are those who say : God is the third of the three ; and there is no god but the One God .
And if they do not withdraw from what they say , there will surely be a painful punishment for those of them who disbelieve .
Will they not turn to Allah in repentance and ask His forgiveness ?
And Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
The Messiah , the son of Mary , was only a messenger ; surely other messengers have passed away before him .
And his mother was a truthful woman ; they both used to eat food .
See how We make the signs clear to them ; and behold , how they are turning away .
Say , &quot; Do you , instead of God , worship something that has no power to harm you or benefit you ? &quot;
And Allah , He is the Hearer , the Knower .
Say : O People of the Book ! Do not exaggerate wrongfully in your faith and do not follow the evil inclinations of a people who erred before and led many astray , and strayed far from the right path .
Cursed were the unbelievers of the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and Jesus , son of Mary ; that was because they disobeyed and transgressed .
They did not forbid one another from the evil they committed ; certainly evil was that which they did .
You see many of them taking the unbelievers as their protectors .
Evil indeed is that which their souls have sent on before them , so that Allah is angry with them , and in the chastisement they will abide eternally .
And if they had believed in Allah and the Prophet and that which is revealed unto him , they would not have taken them for guardians , but many of them are unjust .
Of all men you will find the Jews and those who associate others with Allah to be the most bitter enemies of the believers , and you will certainly find that those who say , &quot; We are Christians &quot; are the friendliest to the believers , because there are priests and monks , and because they are not proud .
And when they hear what has been revealed to the Apostle , you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they recognize ; they say : Our Lord ! we believe , so write us down among the witnesses .
And why should we not believe in Allah and in the truth which has come to us , while we earnestly desire that our Lord should make us righteous ? &quot;
So because of what they said , Allah will reward them with gardens beneath which rivers flow .
They shall abide in it forever ; that is the recompense of the doers of good .
But those who disbelieve and reject Our revelations - these are the inmates of Hell .
O you who believe ! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you , but do not transgress .
Lo ! Allah loveth not transgressors .
Eat of what Allah has given you , lawful and good , and fear Allah in Whom you believe .
Allah will not call you to account for what is unwise in your oaths , but He will call you to account for what you have deliberate oaths ; so its expiation is the feeding of ten poor persons with the average of what you feed your own , or their clothing , or the freeing of a slave .
But if he cannot , let him fast for three days .
This is the expiation of your oaths when you have made them .
And guard your oaths .
Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you , so that you may be grateful .
O you who believe ! Intoxication , gambling , sacrificial stones , and arrows are an abomination , the work of Satan .
Avoid them so that you may prosper .
Satan only wants to provoke enmity and hatred among you through intoxication and gambling , and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer .
Will you then be stopped ?
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware .
But if you turn away from it , then know that Our Messenger &apos;s duty is only to deliver the message clearly .
There is no blame on those who believe and do righteous deeds for what they eat if they fear Allah and believe and do righteous deeds and fear and believe again and do righteous deeds , and Allah loves those who do good .
O ye who believe ! Allah will surely test you with the game which your hands and your spears may reach , that Allah may reward him who feareth Him in secret .
Whoever transgresses thereafter will have a painful punishment .
O you who believe ! Do not kill game while you are on pilgrimage .
And whoever of you kills a beast intentionally is an equivalent from cattle to what he killed , as two righteous men among you say , and that shall be brought to the Ka &apos;bah , as an offering ; or atonement may be the feeding of the poor , or fasting in accordance , that he may taste the evil consequences of his deed .
Allah has pardoned what is past ; but whoever does it again , Allah will punish him with retribution .
And Allah is Mighty , the Lord of Retribution .
It is lawful for you to fish from the sea and to eat from it , as food for you and for the travellers , but forbidden to you is the game of the land as long as you are on pilgrimage .
And fear Allah , to Whom you will be gathered .
Allah has made the Ka &apos;bah , the Sacred House , a place of worship for men , and the sacred month , and the sacrificial animals and the animals with the necklaces . This is so that you may know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is on earth , and that Allah knows all things .
Know that Allah is severe in punishment , and that Allah is Forgiving , Merciful .
It is only for the Messenger to deliver the Message , and God knows what you reveal and what you conceal .
Say , &quot; The bad and the good are not equal , &quot; though the abundance of the bad may astonish you .
So fear Allah , O you of understanding , that you may be successful .
O ye who believe ! Ask not of things which , if disclosed to you , would trouble you ; but if ye ask of them when the Qur &apos;an is being revealed , they will be made plain to you .
Allah has forgiven you ; and Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing .
Before you , a people asked such questions , but they refused to believe in him .
Allah has not ordained any &quot; Bahira &quot; or &quot; Saiba &quot; or &quot; Wasila &quot; or &quot; Ham . &quot; Indeed , those who disbelieve fabricate a lie against Allah , and most of them do not understand .
And when it is said to them , &quot; Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger , &quot; they say , &quot; Sufficient for us is what we found our fathers . &quot; And even if their fathers had no knowledge or guidance , they were not guided .
O you who believe ! Take care of yourselves .
He who goes astray cannot harm you , if you are only on the right path .
To Allah is the return of all of you ; then He will reveal to you of what you used to do .
O you who believe ! When death approaches one of you , the testimony is with you at the time of the opening of the covenant , or two of you who are just , or two others who are not of you , when you are travelling through the land and the calamity of death befalls you .
Ye shall detain them after the prayer , and if ye doubt , they shall swear by Allah , &quot; We shall not be able to gain therewith , even though we be of near kindred , nor shall we conceal the testimony of Allah . &quot;
Then if it is known that the two were guilty of the sin , let two others of those against whom the two testified take their place , and let them swear by Allah : Surely our testimony is truer than the testimony of the two , for then indeed we should be of the wrong @-@ doers .
It is more likely that they will bear true witness , or that they will fear that other oaths would be taken after their oaths .
And fear Allah and listen ; and Allah does not guide the disobedient people .
On the Day when God will gather the messengers , and say , &quot; What response do you give ? &quot; They will say , &quot; We have no knowledge . You are the Knower of the unseen . &quot;
When Allah will say , &quot; O Jesus , son of Mary , remember My favor upon you and upon your mother ; how I supported you with the holy inspiration and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in the manhood ; and how I taught you the Book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel ; and how you fashioned from clay the likeness of a bird , by My permission , and you breathed into it , and it became birds by My permission ; and how by My permission you healed the blind and the lepers ; and how by My permission you raised the dead ; and how I kept the children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear signs and the unbelievers among them said : &quot; This is nothing but obvious magic . &quot; &quot;
And when I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and in My messenger , they said : We believe , and bear witness that we are submissive .
When the disciples said , &apos; O Jesus son of Mary , is thy Lord able to send down for us a table from heaven ? &apos; He said , &apos; Fear God , if you are believers . &apos;
They said , &apos; We desire to eat of it , and our hearts be at rest , and to know that thou hast spoken truly to us , and that we may be witnesses thereof . &apos;
Said Jesus , son of Mary , &quot; O God , our Lord , send down unto us a table out of heaven , that it be for us a festival , the first of us and the last of us , and a sign from Thee ; and provide for us ; Thou art the best of providers . &quot;
Allah said : verily I am going to send it down unto you , but whosoever of you thereafter disbelieveth , verily I shall punish him with a punishment , wherewith I shall not punish anyone in the world .
And when Allah will say : O Jesus , son of Marium ! did you say to men : Take me and my mother for two gods besides Allah ? He will say : Glory be to You !
I could never say what I had no right to say .
If I had said it , you would have known it .
You know what is in my soul , but I do not know what you have in you .
You alone are the Knower of the unseen .
I did not say to them anything except what You commanded me : &quot; Worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord . &quot;
And I was a witness to them while I dwelt among them , but when Thou didst take me away , Thou wast their Watcher , and Thou Thou art witness of everything .
If You punish them , they are Your servants ; and if You forgive them , You are the Almighty , the Wise . &quot;
Allah will say : &quot; This is a Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness .
For them are gardens beneath which rivers flow , wherein they will abide forever .
Allah is well pleased with them , and they are well pleased with Him ; that is the great achievement . &quot;
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them , and He has power over all things .
All praise is due to Allah , Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light ; yet those who disbelieve equate others with their Lord .
He it is Who created you from clay , and then decreed a term ( of life ) , and another term is known to Him .
Yet you are still in doubt !
And He is Allah in the heavens and the earth .
He knows what you conceal and what you declare , and He knows what you do .
And not a sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord , but they turn away from it .
They have denied the truth when it came to them , but soon there will come to them the news of what they ridiculed .
Do they not see how many a generation We have destroyed before them , whom We gave power in the earth such as We have not given to you , and We sent down abundant rains from the sky for them , and made streams flow beneath them , then We destroyed them for their sins , and raised up other generations after them .
And even if We had sent down to you a Book on a piece of paper which they had touched with their hands , the unbelievers would have said : This is nothing but manifest magic .
And they say : &quot; If an angel had been sent down to him ! &quot;
And if We had sent down an angel , the matter would have been decided ; then they would not have been respited .
And if We had made him an angel , We would certainly have made him appear as a people , and We would certainly have caused them confusion in that which they confound .
Messengers before you were ridiculed , but those who ridiculed them were scoffed at .
Say : Travel in the land and see what was the end of the rejecters .
Say : &apos; To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth ? &apos;
Say : Allah .
He has prescribed mercy for Himself .
He will surely gather you together to the Day of Resurrection , of which there is no doubt .
But those who have lost their own souls do not believe .
To Him belongs all that dwells in the night and the day .
And He is the Hearing , the Knowing .
Say : Shall I take for a guardian anyone other than Allah , the Creator of the heavens and the earth , Who feeds ( others ) and is not ( Himself ) fed ?
Say : I am commanded that I should be the first who submits himself , and be not of the polytheists .
Say : Surely I fear , if I disobey my Lord , the chastisement of a grievous day .
Whoever is spared of it on that Day , He has mercy on him ; that is a manifest success .
And if Allah harm you , no one but He can remove it ; and if He gives you good , He has power to do whatever He pleases .
He is the Omnipotent over His servants , and He is the Wise , the Aware .
Say , &quot; What testimony is more weighty ? &quot;
Say : Allah is my witness and your witness ; and this Quran has been revealed to me that I may warn you thereby and whomsoever it reaches .
Do you really bear witness that there are other gods besides God ? &quot;
Say : &apos; I do not testify . &apos;
Say : He is the One Allah , and surely I am far off from that which you worship .
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their sons ; but those who have lost their souls do not believe .
And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or denies His verses ?
Indeed , the wrongdoers will not succeed .
And on the day when We shall gather them all together , We shall say to those who worship idols ( to Allah ) : Where are your gods whom you used to think of ?
Then they will have no excuse but to say : By Allah , our Lord , we were not polytheists .
See how they lie to themselves , and how they let what they have imagined down them .
And among them are some who listen to you , but We have placed on their hearts coverings and deafness in their ears , so they do not understand .
Even if they see every sign , they will not believe in it , so if they come to you , they will dispute with you ; but the unbelievers say : These are but fables of the former .
And they forbid it , and keep away from it .
But they ruin themselves themselves , and yet they do not understand .
If only you could see , when they are made to stand before the Fire , and they will say , &quot; Oh , if only we could return !
Then would we not deny the revelations of our Lord , and we would be of the believers . &quot;
No , what they were concealing before has now become clear to them .
But if they were brought back , they would certainly return to what they were forbidden , and most surely they are liars .
And they say , &quot; There is nothing but our worldly life , and we will not be resurrected . &quot;
If you could but see how they will be made to stand before their Lord ! He will say : Is not this the truth ?
They will say , &quot; Yes , by our Lord . &quot;
He will say : &quot; Then taste the torment , because you were disbelievers . &quot;
Those who deny the meeting with God are the losers .
But when the Hour comes upon them suddenly , they will say , &quot; Woe to us that we have neglected them , &quot; and they will bear their burdens on their backs .
The life of this world is nothing but play and amusement .
And surely the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who guard ( against evil ) .
Do you not then understand ?
We know indeed that what they say grieves you ; and indeed it is not you they reject , but it is the signs of Allah that the unjust reject .
Messengers indeed were denied before you , yet they were denied , and were persecuted , but they remained patient until Our help came to them .
There is none who can alter the words of Allah ; and there has indeed come to you the news of the apostles .
And if their aversion is grievous unto thee , then , if thou canst find a pit in the earth or a ladder in the heaven to bring them a sign ( that thou canst do ) , if it were Allah &apos;s will , He would have brought them together on the right path .
So do not be one of the ignorant .
Only those who listen can record .
As for those who are dead , Allah will raise them up , then they shall be brought back to Him .
They say : &quot; Had there been a sign sent down to him from his Lord ? &quot;
Say : Surely Allah is able to send down a sign , but most of them do not know .
There is not an animal on the earth , nor a bird that flies on its two wings , but are communities like you .
We have neglected nothing in the Book .
They will then be gathered before their Lord .
But those who deny Our revelations are deaf and dumb in darkness .
God leads astray whomever He wills , and whomever He wills , He guides on a straight path .
Say : &quot; What think you ? If the chastisement of God comes upon you , or the Hour overtakes you , will you call upon any other than God , if you are truly ? &quot;
Rather , to Him you will call , and He will remove what you invoke , if He wills , and you will forget what you associate ( with Him ) .
We sent messengers before you to the nations , then We visited them with misery and hardship , so that they might entreat &#91; Me &#93; .
Why then did they not humble themselves when Our punishment came to them ?
But their hearts were hardened , and Satan made all that they did appear good to them .
So when they forgot what they had been reminded of , We opened the gates of all things , until , when they rejoiced in what they were given , We suddenly punished them and they were plunged into despair .
So the people of the unjust were cut off , and all praise is due to Allah , the Lord of the worlds .
Say : What do you think ? If Allah should take away your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts , who is the deity other than Allah who could restore this to you ?
See how variously We explain the Signs , and yet they turn away .
Say : What do you think that if the punishment of Allah should come upon you unexpectedly or manifestly , who would be destroyed except the wrongdoers ?
We send the messengers only as bearers of good news and as warners .
As for those who believe and reform , they shall have no fear , nor shall they grieve .
But as for those who reject Our revelations , the punishment will overtake them , because of their disobedience .
Say : I do not say to you that there are with me the treasures of Allah , nor do I know the unseen ; nor do I say to you that I am an angel ; I only follow that which is revealed to me .
Say , &quot; Are the blind and the seeing alike ?
Will you not then think ? &quot;
And warn with this those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord , when they have no protector or intercessor besides Him , that they may guard ( against evil ) .
And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and in the evening , seeking His countenance .
You are not responsible for them , nor are they responsible for you .
You will drive them away , and you will become one of the wrongdoers .
And thus We have tried some of them by others , that they might say : Are these they whom Allah has favoured from amongst us ?
Does not Allah know best those who are grateful ?
And when those who believe in Our communications come to you , say : Peace be on you .
Your Lord has decreed for Himself mercy : if any of you does evil in ignorance , and thereafter repents , and makes amends , then He is Forgiving , Merciful . &quot;
Thus do We make clear the signs , so that the way of sinners may be known .
Say : I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah .
Say : I do not follow your evil desires , for then I should have gone astray and I should not be of the rightly guided .
Say : I am following a clear evidence from my Lord , and you have rejected it .
What you seek to hasten is not within my power .
The decision rests only with Allah .
He expounds the truth , and He is the best of judges . &quot;
Say : &quot; If what you desire to hasten were within my power , the matter between me and you would be decided ; and God knows best the unjust .
With Him are the keys to the unseen ; He knows them but He .
And He knows all that is in the earth and in the sea .
Not a leaf falleth but He knoweth it , and there is not a grain in the darkness of the earth , nor anything wet or dry , but is in a clear Book .
And He it is Who calls your souls by night , and He knows what you do by day ; then He raises you up in the night , so that the term appointed may be accomplished .
Then to Him will be your return , and He will inform you of what you have done .
And He it is Who has power over all His servants ; and He sends guardians over you till , when death comes to one of you , Our messengers take away his soul , and they do not waste anything .
Then they will be returned to Allah , their Lord .
Surely His is the judgment , and He is the swiftest of reckoners .
Say : &quot; Who delivers you from the land and the sea , when you call upon Him humbly and secretly , saying : &quot; If He delivers us from it , we shall surely be grateful . &quot;
Say : Allah delivereth you from this and from all distress , yet ye ascribe partners unto Him .
Say : &apos; He is Able to send to you a chastisement from above you , or from beneath your feet , or to gather you into parties , and make you taste the violence of one another . &apos;
See how We explain the signs in various ways , that they may understand .
And your people have thought it a lie , even though it is the truth .
Say : &quot; I am not your keeper . &quot;
For every vision there is a time appointed , and soon you will know .
And when thou seest those who speak foolishly of Our communications , then turn away from them until they pass over to another conversation .
If Satan should make you forget , do not sit with the wrongdoers after the remembrance .
The righteous are not accountable for them , but only for the reminder that they may become righteous .
And leave those who play with their religion and consider it a diversion , and who are deluded by the life of the world .
And remind them thereby lest a soul be condemned for that which they have done .
No one will be able to intercede for it besides God . Even if it offers every ransom it will not be accepted from it .
Those are the ones who are given to destruction for their own deeds .
For them is drink of boiling water and a painful doom because they disbelieved .
Say : &quot; Shall we call , apart from God , on that which neither profits nor hurts us , and shall we be turned back on our heels after God has shown us the way like one whom the Satans wander about the land in confusion ? He has companions who call to the right path , &quot; Come to us . &quot; &quot;
Say : The guidance of Allah is the guidance , and we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds .
And ( We have been commanded ) : &quot; Keep up prayer and fear Him , and it is He to whom you will be gathered . &quot;
It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth , and the day He says , &quot; Be ! &quot; it shall be .
His Word is the truth , and His is the kingdom on the day when the sura is thrust .
Knower of the unseen and the visible , He is the Wise , the Most Wise .
And when Abraham said to his father Azar , &quot; Do you take idols for gods ?
I see you and your people in manifest error . &quot;
Then We showed Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth , that he might be of the firm in the faith .
So when the night covered him &#91; with darkness &#93; , he saw a star and said , &quot; This is my Lord . &quot;
But when it went down , he said , &quot; I do not love those that go down . &quot;
And when he saw the moon shining , he said , &quot; This is my Lord . &quot;
But when it went down , he said : Unless my Lord guides me , I shall surely be of those who go astray .
When he saw the sun spreading its light he said , &quot; This is my Lord , this is even greater . &quot;
But when it died , he said , &quot; O my people , indeed I am not with what you associate .
Lo ! I have turned my face toward Him Who created the heavens and the earth , and I am not of the idolaters .
And his people argued with him ; he said : Do you dispute with me about Allah , when He has guided me ?
And I fear not that which ye associate with Him , but that which my Lord wills ; my Lord comprehendeth all things with knowledge .
Will ye not then be admonished ?
And how should I fear that which ye associate with Allah , when ye fear not to associate with Allah that for which He hath not sent down unto you authority ?
So which of the two parties has more right to security , if you should know ?
Those who have faith and do not mix their faith with wrongdoing , it is they who are secure and who are guided .
This is Our proof which We gave to Abraham against his people .
We raise in rank whom We will .
Indeed , your Lord is Wise , Knowing .
And We bestowed upon him Ishaq ( Isaac ) and Jacob ( Jacob ) , and We guided each one of them rightly as We guided Nooh before them , and of his descendants David , Solomon , Job , Joseph , Moses and Aaron .
Thus do We reward the doers of good .
And ( We guided ) Zechariah and John and Jesus and Elijah ; they were all of the righteous .
And ( We guided ) Ishmael and Ishmael , and Elisha , and Jonah , and Lot , and We distinguished each of the nations .
And some of their forefathers and their offspring and their brethren ; and We chose them and guided them on the right path .
That is the guidance of Allah ; so He guides whom He wills of His servants .
But if they had been worshipping other than God , their deeds would have been fruitless .
Those are the ones to whom We gave the Book and wisdom and prophethood .
And if these disbelieve therein , We entrust it to a people who disbelieve not .
Those are they whom God has guided , so follow their guidance .
Say , &quot; I do not ask you for any recompense for it .
It is nothing but a reminder to the worlds . &quot;
They have not valued Allah with His true value when they say , &quot; Allah has not sent down anything to any man . &quot;
Say : Who revealed the Book which Musa brought as a light and a guidance to men , and you make it into papyrus leaves which you show while you conceal much ? And you were taught that which you did not know nor did your fathers .
Say : Allah ; then let them continue to enjoy their vain talk .
And this is a Scripture We have sent down , confirming that which was before it , that you may warn the Mother of the Towns ( Makkah ) and those around her .
Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it , and they are regular in their prayers .
Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah , or says : &quot; It has been revealed to me , &quot; when nothing has been revealed to him , and he says : &quot; I will reveal the like of what Allah has revealed . &quot;
If you could only see the unjust in the depths of death when the angels stretch out their hands , ( saying ) : &quot; Yield up your souls ! Today your reward shall be the chastisement of disgrace , for what you have said of Allah and for turning away proud from His communications . &quot;
And now you have come to Us alone as We created you at first , and you have left what We gave you behind you , and We do not see with you your intercessors whom you thought to be partners in your affairs .
Now you are cut off from one another , and what you had imagined has gone astray from you .
Indeed it is Allah Who germinates grain and kernels ; He brings forth the living from the dead , and He is the one who brings forth the dead from the living .
That is Allah ; then why do you turn away ?
He causes the day to break forth , and He makes the night to rest , and the sun and the moon to reckon . That is the ordaining of the Mighty , the Knowing .
It is He who created the stars for you , so that you may be guided by them in the darkness of land and sea .
Thus We have expounded the revelations for people who have knowledge .
It is He who produced you from a single soul , then a lodging for you in the womb , and a resting @-@ place ( in the grave ) ; and We have set forth signs for a people who understand .
And He it is Who sends down water from the cloud , so We bring forth with it all kinds of plants ; with them , then We bring forth from it green ( vegetation ) from which We bring forth grain , and from the palm tree , from the pollen thereof , and gardens of grapes , olives and pomegranates , alike and unlike .
Look at their fruit when they bear fruit and ripen .
Surely in that are signs for a people who believe .
And they have made the jinn associates of Allah , while He created them , and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters without any knowledge .
Glory be to Him , and exalted be He above what they describe .
Creator of the heavens and the earth , how can He have a son when He has no consort ? He created all things , and He has knowledge of all things .
He is Allah , your Lord ; there is no god but He , the Creator of all things , so worship Him .
He is the guardian of all things .
No vision can attain Him , but He does attain to all vision , and He is the Good , the Aware .
Certainly visible proofs have come to you from your Lord . So whoever sees , it is for his own benefit ; and whoever becomes blind , it is for his own harm .
And I am not a guardian of you .
Thus do We set forth the verses so that they may say , &quot; You have studied , &quot; and that We may clarify them for a people who have knowledge .
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord , there is no god but He , and turn away from the polytheists .
And if Allah had willed , they would not have associated others with Him .
We have not made you a guardian over them , nor are you their guardian .
And do not abuse those whom they invoke besides Allah , lest they should abuse Allah out of envy without any knowledge .
Thus have We made pleasing to every people their deeds .
Then to their Lord they will return , and He will inform them of what they have done .
And they swear by Allah with the highest of their oaths that if a sign came to them , they would surely believe in it .
Say : &quot; The signs are with Allah .
And what will make you certain that when they come , they will believe ? &quot;
And We will turn away their hearts and their eyes because they disbelieved in the first time , and We will leave them in their insolence , blindly wandering .
Even if We sent down angels to them , and the dead spoke to them , and We gathered all things before them , they would not believe , unless God willed ; but most of them are ignorant .
And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy - the Satans of mankind and jinn .
They utter deceptive speech to one another , and if your Lord had willed it , they would not have done it , so leave them to themselves with what they forge .
And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it , and that they may be pleased with it , and that they may earn what they earn .
Shall I then seek a judge other than Allah ? And He it is Who hath revealed unto you the Scripture and hath revealed it unto you .
And those to whom We have given the Book know that it is revealed from your Lord with the truth , so you should not be of the strivers .
And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and justice .
No one can change His words , and He is the Hearer , the Knower .
And if you obey most of those in the earth , they will lead you astray from the way of Allah ; they follow only assumptions and they only make guesses .
Surely your Lord knows best those who stray from His way , and He knows best those who are guided .
So eat that over which the name of Allah has been pronounced , if you are believers in His verses .
Why should you not eat of that over which the Name of God has been mentioned , when He has already made known to you what He has forbidden you , unless you are compelled to it ?
And indeed many lead astray by their own desires through ignorance .
Your Lord knows best the transgressors .
And avoid the open and the secret .
Those who earn sin shall be recompensed for that which they earn .
And eat not of that whereon the name of Allah hath not been pronounced ; for verily that is transgression .
And surely the Shaitans will inspire their friends that they may quarrel with you , and if you obey them , you will be polytheists .
Can he who was dead , to whom We gave life , and a light for whom We made to walk among men , be like him who is in the shadows , from which he cannot emerge ?
Thus the disbelievers were made beautiful what they used to do .
And thus have We made in every town the great ones of their sinners , so that they may plan therein ; and they do not plan but against their own souls , and they do not perceive .
And when a sign comes to them , they say : We will not believe until we are given the like of what Allah &apos;s apostles are given .
Allah knows best to whom He entrusts His message .
Humiliation from Allah , and a severe punishment , will afflict the criminals for their scheming .
And whomsoever Allah wills to guide , He expands his breast to Islam ; and whomsoever He wills to lead astray , He makes his breast narrow and constricted , as if he were climbing up to the sky .
That is how Allah is the punishment of those who do not believe .
And this is the path of thy Lord , a straight path . We have set forth the signs for a people who are admonished .
For them is a home of peace with their Lord , and He is their Protector because of what they do .
And on the day when He shall gather them all together , He will say : O you jinn ! you have made for yourselves many of mankind .
Their friends among mankind will say , &quot; Our Lord , some of us have benefited from other benefits , but we have reached our term which You have decreed for us . &quot;
He will say : &quot; The Fire be your dwelling @-@ place , you will dwell therein forever , except as Allah wills . &quot;
Indeed , your Lord is Wise , Knowing .
So We set some of the wrongdoers above the others because of what they earned .
&quot; O ye jinn and men ! Have not there come to you from among you messengers who told you My communications and warned you of the coming of this day of yours ? &quot;
They will say , &quot; We testify against ourselves . &quot;
The life of this world beguiled them , and they will bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers .
This is because your Lord would not destroy the towns unjustly while their inhabitants were warned .
Each one has ranks for what he has done , and your Lord is not ignorant of what they do .
And your Lord is the One Who is without need , and to Whom belongs mercy .
If He wills , He will take you away , and replace you with what is pleasing to Him , just as He produced you from the offspring of other people .
Verily that which ye are promised shall come to pass , and ye cannot prevent .
Say : &quot; O people ! Act according to your position , and I will act .
Soon you will know who will receive the final reward of the abode . &quot;
Indeed , the wrongdoers will never succeed .
And they set aside for Allah a share of the crops and cattle that He has raised , and they say : This is for Allah , according to their deeds , and this for our associates ; but what is for their associates , it is not for Allah , and what is for Allah reaches their associates .
Evil is what they judge .
Likewise , their associates have made the slaying of their children seem acceptable to many of the idolaters , in order to destroy them and confuse their faith .
Had Allah willed , they would not have done so ; so leave them to their own devices what they forged .
And they said : These cattle and crops are sacred ; none shall eat thereof save whom we allow , as they thought , and there are cattle whose backs are forbidden , and cattle over which they say not the name of Allah , fabricating a lie against Allah .
Soon He will repay them for what they fabricate .
And they say : whatsoever is in the bellies of such cattle is for our males only and forbidden to our females , and if it be born dead , they all are partakers thereof .
He will reward them for their claim .
Lo ! He is Wise , Knowing .
Lo ! those who kill their children foolishly , without knowledge , and forbid what God has given them , forging against God a lie .
Indeed , they have gone astray , and they are not guided .
And He it is Who makes gardens grow , with and without stakes , and the date palm and the fields , of crops of different kinds , and olives and pomegranates , similar and dissimilar .
Eat of its fruits when it yields fruit , and pay the poor thereof on the day of the harvest , and be not prodigal ; verily He loveth not the unreasonable .
Among the livestock are animals of burden , and animals for slaughter .
Eat of that which Allah hath given you , and follow not the footsteps of Satan ; verily he is unto you an enemy manifest .
Eight pairs : two of the sheep , and two of the goats .
Say : &apos; Is it the two males He has forbidden , or the two females , or what the wombs of the two females enclose ?
Tell me with knowledge , if you are truthful . &quot;
Of camels two , of oxen two . Say : &apos; Is it the two males He has forbidden you , or the two females , or what the wombs of the two females enclose ?
Were you with them when Allah commanded you to do this ? &quot;
So who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against Allah in order to mislead people without knowledge ?
God does not guide the unjust people .
Say : I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to him who eats it , unless it be of itself , or blood poured forth , or the flesh of swine ; that is an abomination , or an abomination , wherein a name other than that of Allah is invoked .
But if anyone is driven by necessity , committing no disobedience , nor transgressing , then surely your Lord is Forgiving , Merciful , Most Merciful .
For the Jews We forbade every animal with claws ; and of oxen and sheep We forbade them their fat , except what is on their backs or in the entrails or in the bones .
Thus have We repaid them for their rebellion , and indeed We are truthful .
But if they deny you , &#91; O Muhammad &#93; , say , &quot; Your Lord is the Most Merciful , but His severity shall not be withdrawn from the people of criminals . &quot;
The polytheists will say , &quot; Had God willed , neither we nor our forefathers would have associated anything with Him , nor would we have done anything without His permission . &quot;
Likewise , even those who were before them denied until they tasted Our severity .
Say : Have ye any knowledge ?
Then bring it to us .
But you follow nothing but conjecture , and you do nothing but puzzle . &quot;
Say , &quot; Allah has the conclusive proof .
Had He willed , He would have guided you all . &quot;
Say : &quot; Bring your witnesses who can testify that Allah has forbidden this . &quot;
If they testify , do not testify with them . And do not follow the desires of those who deny Our revelations , and those who do not believe in the Hereafter , and equate others with their Lord .
Say : &quot; Come , I will recite what your Lord has forbidden you : that you shall not ascribe any partners to Him , and that you shall be good to parents , and that you shall not kill your children out of poverty , for We provide for you and for them ; you shall not approach indecency , whether it be open or hidden , and that you do not kill anyone whose life Allah has made sacred , except in the course of justice .
This is what He has enjoined upon you , so that you may understand .
And do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best interests of the orphan until he has reached his full age and give full measure and weight in equity .
We do not ask a soul for anything beyond what it can accomplish .
And when you give a statement , be just , even if it concerns a close relative . And fulfill the covenant of Allah .
That is what He commands you , that you may be reminded . &quot;
This is My straight path , so follow it , and do not follow the paths , lest they divert you from His path .
That is what He commands you , that you may be righteous .
Then We gave Moses the Book , completing ( the favour ) to the One who did good and as a clarification and as guidance and mercy , so that they might believe in the encounter with their Lord .
And this is a Book which We have sent down , blessed ; so follow it , and be careful of sin , that you may find mercy .
lest you should say : &apos; The Book was sent down to two nations before us , and we had no knowledge of their contents . &apos;
Or lest you should say : If only the Book had been revealed to us , we would certainly have been better guided than they .
There has now come to you a clear proof from your Lord , a guidance and a mercy .
Who then is more unjust than he who rejects the communications of Allah and turns away from them ?
We will surely afflict those who turn away from Our signs with a terrible punishment , for they have turned away .
Are they waiting for the angels or your Lord to come to them , or for some of your Lord &apos;s signs to come ?
On the Day when some of your Lord &apos;s Signs come , no one will benefit from their faith unless he had believed previously , or had done some good in his faith .
Say , &quot; Wait , we too are waiting . &quot;
As for those who divided their religion and became political parties , you have nothing to do with them .
Their affair is surely judged by Allah ; then He will tell them what they have done .
Whoever does a good deed shall be recompensed ten times ; but whoever does an evil deed , he shall receive only the same as his reward , and they shall not be wronged ; and whoever does evil will not be wronged .
Say : Surely my Lord has guided me to a right path , the right religion , the faith of Ibrahim the upright one , and he was not of the polytheists .
Say : &apos; My prayer , my sacrifice , and my life and my death belong to Allah , the Lord of the Worlds .
He has no one with Him , and I am commanded to do so , and I am the first of those who submit . &quot;
Say : Shall I seek a Lord other than Allah , when He is the Lord of all things ?
And no soul does anything except against itself , and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another .
Then to your Lord is your return , and He will inform you about that over which you used to differ .
And He it is Who hath made you successors in the earth , and hath raised some of you above others in degrees , that He may prove you by that which He hath given you .
Indeed your Lord is swift in retribution ; and indeed , He is Forgiving , Merciful .
Alif Lam Mim Sad .
( This is ) a Book revealed to you ; you shall not be afflicted on account of it , and you shall be warned with it , and it shall be a reminder to the believers .
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord , and do not follow other guardians besides Him .
How little you remember !
And how many a township have We destroyed , and Our punishment came upon them at night or while they were resting at noon .
Their only cry was , when Our punishment came upon them , that they said : &quot; We were indeed wrongdoers ! &quot;
We will ask those to whom the messengers have been sent , and We will ask the messengers .
Then We will relate to them with knowledge , for We were never absent .
And the weighing on that Day will be true .
Those whose scales are heavy will prosper .
But those whose scales are light are those who have lost their souls , because they have gone against Our revelations .
Verily We have given you power in the earth , and therein provided for you livelihood ; how little are you grateful !
And certainly We created you , then We fashioned you , then We said to the angels : Prostrate yourselves before Adam , and they all prostrate ; but not Iblis ; he was not of those who bowed down .
He said , &quot; What prevented you from prostrating yourself when I commanded you ? &quot;
He said : &quot; I am better than him .
You created me from fire , but You created him from clay . &quot;
Down with you from here , it is not fitting for you to be haughty here ; you should be arrogant .
Get out , for you are one of the humiliated . &quot;
He said , &quot; Give me respite till the day they are resurrected . &quot;
He said , &quot; You are granted respite . &quot;
He said : Because Thou hast sent me astray , surely I will lie in ambush for them on Thy straight path .
Then I will come upon them from before them and from behind them , from the right and from the left , and You will not find most of them grateful . &quot;
( Allah ) said : &quot; Get thee out , despised and rejected !
Whoever of them follows you , I will fill Hell with you all . &quot;
&quot; O Adam ! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden , and eat whatsoever things ye will of , but draw not nigh this tree , lest ye become unjust . &quot;
But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to them that he might reveal to them that which was hidden from them of their shame , he said : Your Lord did not forbid you this tree except that you should not become angels or eternal .
And he swore to them , &quot; Indeed , I am to you a trustworthy adviser . &quot;
So he misled them with deceit .
And when they tasted of the tree , their shame became manifest to them , and they began to clothe themselves with the leaves of the garden , and their Lord called out to them : Did I not forbid you from this tree and say to you : Surely the Shaitan is your manifest enemy ?
They said , &quot; Our Lord , we have wronged ourselves , and if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us , we will surely be among the losers . &quot;
He said : Get down , one of you is enemy to the other , and there shall be for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time .
He said : Therein ye shall live , and therein ye shall die , and therefrom ye shall be brought forth .
O Children of Adam ! We have given you a garment to cover your shame and as an adornment ; and the garment of piety - that is the best .
This is the sign of God , so that they may take heed .
O Children of Adam ! Let not Satan seduce you , as he drove your parents out of the Garden , stripping them of their garments to show them their shame .
Lo ! he seeth you , he and his band , from whence ye see them not .
Lo ! We have made the Satans friends of those who believe not .
And when they commit an indecency they say : We found our fathers doing this , and Allah has enjoined it on us .
Say : Surely Allah does not enjoin indecency .
Do you say of Allah what you do not know ? &quot;
Say : &apos; My Lord has commanded justice ; and turn your faces at every place of prayer , and call upon Him in sincere obedience .
As He brought you into being , so will you return ( to Him ) . &quot;
A group He has guided , and to another , by right , error was given , because they had taken the Shaitans as allies besides Allah , and they thought that they were guided .
O children of Adam ! Eat in every place of worship , and drink , and be not extravagant ; surely He does not love the extravagant .
Say : Who has forbidden the good things of Allah which He has brought forth for His servants and the good things of provision ?
Say : They are , in this life , for those who believe , ( and ) purely for them on the Day of Resurrection .
Thus do We make clear the signs for a people who have knowledge .
Say : My Lord has only forbidden indecency , whether manifest or hidden , and sin , and unjust violence ; and that you associate with Allah that which He has not revealed , and that you should say of Allah what you do not know .
To every nation a term has been set , and when their time has come , they cannot delay ( it ) for an hour , nor can they bring it forward .
O children of Adam ! If there come to you apostles from among you who relate My communications to you concerning those who guard ( against evil ) and do good , they shall have no fear , nor shall they grieve .
But those who reject Our revelations and turn away with arrogance , - they will be companions of the Fire , to dwell therein for ever .
Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah or denies His verses ?
For such is the portion ( of the people ) until Our messengers come to them to kill them , and they say : Where then is that which you invoked besides Allah ?
They will say , &quot; We cannot find them &quot; ; and they will bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers .
He will say : &apos; Enter the Fire and join the hosts of jinn and mankind who passed away before you . &apos;
Every time a group enters , it curses its sisterhood until at last , when they have all come into it one after the other , the last of them will say to the first of them : &apos; Our Lord , these led us astray , so give them a double punishment of the Fire . &apos;
He will say : &quot; Each one has ( them ) several times , but you do not know . &quot;
And the first will say to the last : &quot; Then you had no advantage before us , so taste the torment for what you did . &quot;
Verily , those who belie Our communications and turn away from them , the Gates of Heaven will not be opened , nor will they enter Paradise until a camel passes through the eye of a needle . And those who reject Our revelations will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle .
And thus do We reward the criminals .
They shall have a bed of Hell , and over them a covering .
And thus do We reward the wrongdoers .
But those who believe and do righteous deeds - We do not burden any soul beyond its wealth . They are the dwellers of Paradise ; they will abide therein eternally .
And We will remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts .
Rivers shall flow beneath them , and they shall say : &quot; Praise belongs to Allah who has guided us to this .
We would not have found the way had Allah not guided us .
The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring the truth . &quot;
And it will be proclaimed to them , &quot; This is Paradise , which you have inherited for what you have done &quot; . &quot;
The inhabitants of Paradise will call out to the inhabitants of Hell : &quot; We have found what our Lord promised us to be true .
Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true ? &quot;
They will say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Then a crier from among them announces , &quot; The curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers ,
who prevent them from the way of God and seek to make it crooked and do not believe in the Hereafter .
And between the two there will be a partition , and on the heights will be men who will recognise them both by their marks , and they will call out to the people of Paradise , &quot; Peace be upon you &quot; ; they have not yet entered Paradise , although they hope .
And when their eyes turn towards the dwellers of the Fire , they say : Our Lord ! make us not the people of the unjust .
And the ( people ) on the heights will call out to the people whom they will recognize by their marks , saying , &quot; What you have gathered together has not yielded you anything , nor has your pride yielded you anything .
Are these the ones of whom you swore that Allah would not show them mercy ? &quot;
Enter Paradise ; you shall have no fear , nor shall you grieve .
And the dwellers of the Fire will call to the dwellers of Paradise : &quot; Pour on us some water or anything that Allah has given you . &quot;
They will say , &quot; Indeed , Allah has forbidden them both to the disbelievers .
who regarded their religion as an amusement and played with it and were beguiled by the life of the world . &quot;
On this day We forget them as they forgot the meeting of this their Day , and as they used to deny Our revelations .
And indeed We have brought to them a Book which We have explained with knowledge , as a guidance and a mercy for the people who believe .
Are they waiting for anything but its interpretation ?
On the day when its interpretation will become a reality , those who had forgotten it before will say , &quot; The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring the truth .
Do we have any intercessors to intercede for us ?
Or could we be sent back so that we might do other than what we did ? &quot;
They have ruined their souls , and what they used to fabricate has forsaken them .
Lo ! your Lord is Allah , Who created the heavens and the earth in six days , and then made Himself majestic ( to His kingdom ) : He covers the night the day that follows it with haste , and ( He ) He created the sun and the moon and the stars subservient to His command .
Indeed , His is the creation , and His command .
Blessed is Allah , the Lord of the Worlds .
Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret .
Lo ! He loveth not transgressors .
And do not cause corruption on the earth after there is order , and invoke Him in fear and hope .
Lo ! the mercy of Allah is nigh unto those who do good works .
It is He who , in His mercy , sends the winds as glad tidings , till , when they bear a heavy cloud , We drive them to a dead place , and We send down water from it , and bring forth with it fruits of every kind .
Thus do We bring forth the dead , that you may be reminded .
And the good place -- its vegetation sprouts by the permission of its Lord ; and the evil place -- it sprouts but scantily .
Thus do We turn the signs to a people who are grateful .
We sent Noah to his people , and he said , &apos; O my people , serve God , you have no god other than Him ; surely I fear for you the chastisement of a mighty day . &apos;
The chiefs of his people said : Most surely we see you in manifest error .
O my people ! there is no error in me , but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds .
I deliver to you the messages of my Lord , and I advise you sincerely , and I know from Allah what you do not know .
Do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your Lord through a man from among you , that he may warn you , so that you may fear God , and so that you may be shown mercy ? &quot;
But they denied him , so We delivered him and those with him in the ship , and We drowned those who rejected Our Signs ; most surely they were a blind people .
And to the Ad &#91; We sent &#93; their brother Hud .
He said , &quot; O my people , worship Allah ; you have no deity other than Him .
Will you not be godfearing ? &quot;
The disbelieving leaders of his people said : &apos; We see you in foolishness , and we consider you to be a liar . &apos;
He said : O my people ! there is no folly in me , but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds .
I convey unto you the messages of my Lord , and I am unto you a sincere and true counsellor .
Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you that he may warn you ?
And remember when He made you heirs of the people of Noah , and gave you abundant increase .
Remember the favours of Allah , that ye may prosper .
They said : &quot; Have you come to us that we should worship Allah Alone and forsake what our fathers worshipped ?
Bring to us what you promise us , if you are truthful . &quot;
He said : Surely the chastisement and the wrath of your Lord have now fallen upon you .
Will you dispute with me over names which ye have named , ye and your fathers , for which Allah hath sent down no authority ?
Wait then ; I will be with you among those who wait . &quot;
Then We delivered him and those who were with him by Our mercy , and We cut off the last branch of those who rejected Our communications and disbelieved .
And to Thamud &#91; We sent &#93; their brother Saleh .
He said , &quot; O my people , worship Allah ; you have no deity other than Him .
Indeed , there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord . This mare of camel of Allah is a sign for you .
So let them graze on the earth of Allah , and do her no harm , lest a painful chastisement should befall you .
And remember when He made you successors of the Ad and gave you in the land a place ; you build palaces on its plains , and dig up dwellings in the mountains .
So remember the favors of Allah and do not commit evil in the land , causing harm .
The high of his people who were arrogant said to those who were oppressed , those among them who had faith , &quot; Are you certain that Saleh was sent by his Lord ? &quot;
They said : Surely we are believers in what he has been sent with .
The arrogant ones said , &quot; We reject what you believe in . &quot;
Then they cut the sinews of the camel @-@ mare and defied their Lord , and said : O Salih ! bring to us that wherewith thou threatenest us if thou art of the apostles .
So the earthquake seized them , and in the morning they lay down in their dwellings .
Then he turned away from them and said : O my people ! surely I delivered to you the message of my Lord and gave you good advice , but you love not the counsellors .
And Lot , when he said to his people , &apos; What , do you commit an indecency as no one in the world has ever done before you ?
Indeed , you strive with men instead of women .
Nay , you are a dissolute people . &quot;
Then the answer of his people was none other than that : &quot; Cast them forth from your city , for they are men who will purify themselves . &quot;
Then We saved him and his family , except his wife ; she was of those who remained behind .
And We rained down upon them a great rain .
Now see how was the end of the evildoers !
And to the Madyan &#91; We sent &#93; their brother Shuaib .
He said , &quot; O my people , worship Allah ; you have no deity other than Him .
Now a clear sign has come to you from your Lord , so give full measure and weight and do not diminish the affairs of the people , and do not cause mischief on earth according to their order .
This is better for you if you are believers .
And do not lie in wait on every path , threatening and turning away from Allah &apos;s way those who believe in Him , and seeking to make it crooked .
Remember how you were few and He multiplied you .
And see how was the end of the mischief @-@ makers !
And if there are among you those who believe in that with which I have been sent and others who disbelieve , then be patient until Allah judges between us ; and He is the best of judges .
The nobles of his people , arrogant , said : O Shu &apos;aib , we will expel you and the faithful who are with you from our town , unless you return to our religion .
He said , &quot; Even if we are not willing to do so ?
Indeed , we would have fabricated a lie against Allah if we return to your religion after Allah has rescued us from it ; and it is not for us to return to your religion except if Allah , our Lord , wills it ; our Lord covers all things with knowledge ; in Allah do we trust ; O our Lord ! judge between us and our people according to the truth ; for it is Thou Who decides best .
And the eminent among his people who disbelieved said , &quot; If you should follow Shu &apos;aib , indeed , you would be lost . &quot;
Then the earthquake seized them , and in the morning they lay down in their dwellings .
Those who had accused Suaib of lying became as if they had never dwelt therein ; those who had accused Suaib of lying , were themselves the losers .
Then he turned away from them , and said , &apos; O my people , I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord , and I have given you sincere advice .
How can I grieve for the unbelievers ? &quot;
Never did We send a Prophet to a town , but We visited its people with distress and affliction in order that they might humble themselves .
Then We changed the evil for good , until they grew up , and We said : Even our fathers were afflicted and rejoiced .
Then We seized them suddenly , while they did not perceive .
And if the people of the towns had believed and feared Allah , We would certainly have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth , but they rejected ( the truth ) , so We seized them for what they had done .
Are the people of the cities secure that Our punishment will not come upon them at night while they are asleep ?
Or are the people of the cities secure from Our punishment while they are at play ?
Are they then secure against the plan of Allah ?
But no one can feel secure from the plan of God except the people of the losers .
Do not they understand who inherit the earth from its &#91; previous &#93; inhabitants , that if We will , We can afflict them for their sins , and set a seal upon their hearts , so they do not hear ?
These are the towns whose story We relate to you .
And most surely their messengers had come to them with clear proofs , but they would not believe in that which they had denied before .
Thus does Allah seal the hearts of the disbelievers .
We found most of them untrue to their covenants ; but most of them We found wrongdoers .
Then , after them , We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs , but they wronged them .
Now see how was the end of the evildoers !
And Moses said : O Pharaoh , I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds .
It is not proper for me to say anything about Allah except the truth ; I have come to you from your Lord with clear proof , therefore let the children of Israel go with me .
He said , &quot; If you have come with a sign , then show it , if you are truthful . &quot;
So he threw down his staff , and behold , it was a serpent in flesh .
Then he pulled out his hand , and it looked white to the audience ( all at once ) .
The nobles of Pharaoh &apos;s people said : &quot; This is indeed a sorcerer of knowledge .
He wants to drive you out of your land .
So what is your motivation ? &quot;
They said : &quot; Wait with him and his brother a while , and send heralds to the cities ,
that they may bring to you every skilful magician .
And the magicians came to Pharaoh , saying , &apos; We shall surely have a reward , if we should be the victors . &apos;
He said , &quot; Yes , and you will be among those near &#91; to us &#93; . &quot;
They said : &quot; O Moses ! Either you throw ( it ) , or we throw ( it first ) . &quot;
He said , &quot; You should throw . &quot;
And when they threw , they bewitched the eyes of the people , and struck terror into them , and produced a great magic .
And We revealed to Moses : &quot; Cast thy staff , &quot; and behold , it swallowed up all the falsehoods they showed .
Thus was the truth established , and their works proved null .
Then they were vanquished there , and they went back ashamed .
And the sorcerers fell down in adoration .
They said : We believe in the Lord of the Worlds .
the Lord of Moses and Aaron . &quot;
Said Pharaoh , &apos; You have believed him before I gave you leave .
Surely , this is a plot which you have plotted in the city to expel its people from it , but you shall soon know .
Surely I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately , then I will crucify you all . &quot;
They said : &quot; Then we will return to our Lord .
You will only take revenge on us because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us .
Our Lord , grant us patience and let us die as Muslims . &quot;
The leaders of Pharaoh &apos;s people said : &quot; Will you allow Moses and his people to do mischief in the land and abandon you and your gods ? &quot; He said : &quot; We will kill their sons and leave their wives alive , for we have dominion over them . &quot;
And Moses said to his people , &quot; Seek help from Allah and be patient .
The earth is God &apos;s earth ; He has bequeathed it to whomsoever He will of His servants ; and the end is for the godfearing . &quot;
They said , &quot; We suffered before you came before you came to us and after you have come to us . &quot;
He said : &quot; It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemies and grant you authority in the land . Then He will see what you do . &quot;
And We punished Pharaoh &apos;s people with droughts and shortages of fruits , that they might be reminded .
But when good came to them , they said : &apos; This is our due &apos; and when evil afflicted them , they attributed it to the misfortune of Moses and those with him .
Now , surely their evil is with Allah only , but most of them do not know it .
And they said , &quot; Whatever sign you bring us , to bewitch us with , we will not believe in you . &quot;
So We sent upon them the flood and the locusts and the lice and the frogs and the blood - clear signs - but they were arrogant and were a sinful people .
Whenever the plague fell upon them , they would say , &quot; O Moses , pray to your Lord for us and invoke the promise He has made to you .
If you remove the plague from us , we will certainly believe in you , and we will let the Children of Israel go with you . &quot;
But when We removed from them the torment for a term which they had to fulfil , behold ! they broke their word .
So We punished them and drowned them in the sea , because they denied Our revelations and were not attentive .
And We made the people , who were considered weak , inherit the eastern parts of the land , and the western parts which We had blessed .
And the Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of their patience , and We destroyed all that Pharaoh and his people had created and all that they had built .
And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea , and they came to a people who were devoted to their idols , and they said , &quot; O Moses , make for us a god just as they have gods . &quot;
He said , &quot; You are unteachable people .
Indeed , they are the ones to perish because of what they have done , and what they have been doing will be vain . &quot;
He said : Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah , when He hath distinguished you above all nations ?
And remember the time when We saved you from the people of Pharaoh , who afflicted you with the worst torment , slaughtering your sons and saving your wives .
And in that was a great trial from your Lord .
And We made an appointment with Musa for thirty nights , and We completed them with ten ; so the appointment of his Lord was completed forty nights .
And Moses said to his brother Aaron : Represent me among my people , and be upright , and do not follow the way of the mischief @-@ makers .
And when Musa came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him , he said : My Lord ! show me ( Thyself ) , that I may look at Thee .
He said : Thou shalt not see Me , but look upon the mountain ; if it remains in its place , then thou shalt see Me .
So when his Lord appeared to the mountain , He made it crumble to dust , and Moses fell down unconscious .
And when he returned , he said , &quot; Glory be to You , I repent to You , and I am the first of the believers . &quot;
He said : O Musa ! surely I have chosen you above men by My messages and by My words ; so take what I have given you and be of the grateful ones .
And We wrote for him on the Tablets all kinds of exhortation and clear explanation of all things ( and said ) : Hold it fast , and command thy people to follow the best thereof .
Soon I will show you the place of the wrongdoers .
But I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant in the land against all right , and even though they see all signs , they will not believe in it ; and when they see the way of righteousness , they do not want to accept it as the way ; and if they see the way of error , they will accept it as the way .
This is because they rejected Our revelations and did not pay heed to them .
Those who deny Our revelations and their meeting in the Hereafter , their deeds will come to nothing .
Can they be rewarded for anything other than what they did ?
The people of Moses took , after his departure , out of their ornaments , a bodily calf which braved .
Did they not see that it could not speak to them , nor guide them to the way ?
They took it for themselves , and they were evildoers .
And when they were afflicted with remorse and saw that they had gone astray , they said : If our Lord have not mercy on us and forgive us , then we shall surely be of the losers .
And when Moses returned to his people , angry and grieved , he said , &quot; It is evil that you have done in my place in my absence .
Did you hasten the command of your Lord ? &quot;
And he threw down the tablets , and seized his brother by the head , and dragged him toward him .
&#91; Aaron &#93; said , &quot; Son of my mother , indeed the people considered me weak and almost killed me .
So let not the enemies rejoice over me , and do not place me among the wrongdoing people . &quot;
He said : My Lord ! forgive me and my brother , and make us enter into Your Mercy ; surely You are the Most Merciful .
Indeed , those who took the calf &#91; for worship &#93; will be the wrath of their Lord and disgrace in the life of this world .
Thus do We reward those who invent falsehood .
As for those who do evil , and then repent and believe , your Lord is the Forgiving , the Most Merciful .
And when the anger of Moses abated , he took up the tablets , and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord .
And Moses chose from among his people seventy men for Our appointment .
But when the earthquake struck them , he said , &quot; My Lord , if You had willed , You could have destroyed them before and me .
Will You destroy us because of what the fools among us have done ?
This is but a trial from Thee : by it Thou mayest mislead whom Thou wilt , and wilt show the way to whom Thou wilt .
You are our Protector , so forgive us and have mercy on us , for You are the best of those who forgive .
And ordain for us what is good in this world and in the Hereafter , for to You we have turned . &quot;
He said : I will strike with My punishment whom I will , and My mercy encompasses all things ; so I will ordain it for those who fear Me and give the Zakah and those who believe in Our revelations .
Those are they who follow the Messenger , the Prophet , who is ignorant in the Torah and the Gospel , and there they will find about him : he commands them good and forbids evil , and he permits them good things , and forbids bad things from them , and he relieves them of their burdens and the shackles that were upon them ; so those who believe in him , and strengthen him , and help him , and follow him , and the light revealed with him , let them be successful .
Say : O mankind ! Lo ! I am an apostle unto you all , of Allah , unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth .
There is no god but He ; He gives life and causes death .
So believe in Allah and His Messenger , the Prophet , who is ignorant of reading and writing , and who believes in Allah and His Words , and follow him that you may be guided .
And among the people of Moses there is a community who guide the way in truth and then do justice .
And We divided them into twelve tribes into nations . And We revealed Moses , when his people asked him to drink : &apos; Strike the rock with your staff . &apos;
Then there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs : each tribe knew its drinkingplace , and We made them overshadowed by clouds , and We sent down unto them manna and quails : eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you .
And they did not harm Us , but they wronged themselves .
And when it is said to them , &quot; Dwell in this city and take of it your food wherever you will , and say , &quot; Forgiveness , &quot; enter in at the gate prostrating yourselves , and We will forgive you your sins ; surely We will do more to those who do good . &quot;
But the wrongdoers among them changed the sentence for another than that given to them ; so We sent down upon them a plague from heaven , because of their wrongdoing .
And ask them about the town that was by the sea , how they profaned the Sabbath , how their fish came to them in droves on their Sabbath day , but on the day when they did not observe the Sabbath , they did not come to them .
Thus did We test them because they were transgressors .
And when a community among them said : Why do you admonish a people whom Allah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe chastisement ? They said : To excuse your Lord and that they may guard ( against evil ) .
And when they forgot what they had been reminded of , We saved those who restrained the evil and seized the unjust with a painful punishment because they had transgressed .
Then , when they rebelled against what they had been forbidden , We said to them , &quot; Be apes despised ! &quot;
And when your Lord proclaimed He would send against them , till the Day of Resurrection , those who would inflict on them a terrible chastisement ; surely your Lord is quick to requite ( evil ) , and He is most surely the Forgiving , the Merciful .
And We have cut them up into nations in the earth ; some of them are righteous , and some of them are not ; and We tried them with good and evil , that they may turn back .
Then there succeeded them who inherited the Scripture , but they take the poor of this world , saying , &quot; We will be forgiven . &quot;
But if ( again ) the goods of the like ( again ) came to them , they would come to them again .
Was not the covenant of the Scripture made with them , that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth ?
And they have read what is in it .
And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah .
Do you not understand ?
And those who hold fast to the Book and establish prayer , We will not allow to be lost the reward of the righteous .
And when We shook the mountain above them as if it were a shadowy , and they imagined that it was going to fall on them ; and We said : hold fast to that which We have bestowed on you , and remember that which is therein , that you may guard ( against evil ) .
When your Lord brought forth from the sons of Adam , from their loins , their descendants , and made them witnesses against Himself , ( He said ) : &quot; Am I not your Lord ? &quot;
Lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection : &apos; We were unaware of this . &apos;
Or lest you say : &quot; It was only our fathers who were polytheists before , and we were a generation after them .
Will You destroy us because of what the falsifiers have done ? &quot;
Thus do We make clear the signs so that they may turn back .
And relate to them the story of him to whom We gave Our signs , but he passed by them ; so Satan followed after him , and he went astray .
And if We had willed , We could have exalted him thereby , but he inclined to the earth and followed his own inclination .
So his tongue is like a dog : if you drive him away , he will stick out his tongue ; but if you put out his tongue , he will stick out his tongue .
Such is the fate of the people who deny Our communications .
So tell them the stories , so that they may reflect .
Evil is the example of the people who reject Our revelations and wrong themselves .
Whomsoever Allah guides , he is on the right path ; and whomsoever He leads astray , verily they are the losers .
And certainly We have created for them many jinn and men , whose end will be hell with which they do not understand , and they have eyes with which they do not see , and they have ears with which they do not hear , and they are like cattle , nay , they are more astray from the way ( of Allah ) .
Indeed , they are reckless .
And to Allah belong the Most Beautiful Names , so call on Him with them , and leave those who take a wrong attitude concerning His Names ; they shall be recompensed for what they have done .
And of those whom We have created there is a nation who guides with the truth , and by it they are just .
And those who reject Our communications , We will humiliate them step by step without them understanding how this happened .
And I will give them respite ; surely My plan is strong .
Have they not reflected that their companion is not possessed ?
He is nothing but a plain warner .
Do they not consider the kingdom of the heavens and the earth , and whatever things Allah has created , and that the term of their life may have drawn near ?
In what else will they believe after this proclamation ?
For him whom Allah leads astray , there is none to guide him ; and He causes them to wander blindly in their rebellion .
They ask you about the Hour , &quot; When will it come ? &quot;
Say : The knowledge thereof is with my Lord .
None but He can reveal its time .
Heavy is it in the heavens and on the earth .
It will not come upon you but suddenly . &quot;
They ask you as if you had full knowledge of it .
Say : The knowledge thereof is with my Lord , but most of mankind know not .
Say : &apos; I have no power to profit for myself , or hurt , except Allah will .
And if I had knowledge of the unseen , I should have secured for myself the fullness of good , and evil would not have touched me .
I am but a warner and a bearer of good tidings to the people who believe . &quot;
It is He who created you from a single soul , and from it He created its mate , that he might dwell with her .
When he had attended her , she was pregnant with a light burden and walked around with it .
And if it becomes heavy , they both call upon Allah , their Lord : If Thou givest us a goodly child , we shall surely be of the thankful .
But when He gives them a good &#91; child &#93; , they ascribe to Him a good gift .
Exalted is Allah above all that they associate with Him .
Do they associate with Him those who do not create anything and are themselves the creators ?
And they are not able to give them help , nor can they help themselves .
And if you call them to guidance , they will not follow you .
It is all the same for you whether you call them or remain silent .
Those whom you invoke besides God are themselves created like you .
Call upon them , and let them answer you , if you are truthful .
Do they have feet to walk with ? Or have they hands to hold ? Or do they have eyes to see ? Or do they have ears to hear ?
Say : Call upon your gods , then devise cunning against me , and leave me not long .
Lo ! my Protector is Allah Who hath revealed the Scripture , and He guardeth the righteous .
But those whom you call upon besides Him cannot help you , nor can they help themselves . &quot;
And if you call them to guidance , they will not hear .
You will see them looking at you , but they will not see .
Be forgiving , command the just , and turn away from the ignorant .
And if you are incited to evil by Satan , then take refuge in Allah ; surely He is Hearing , Knowing .
Surely those who guard ( against evil ) , when a visitation from the Shaitan afflicts them , then they are reminded , lo ! at once they see .
But their brethren ( the heathen ) lead them to continue in error , then they do not cease .
When you do not bring them a sign , they say , &quot; Why do you not find it ? &quot;
Say : I follow only that which is revealed to me from my Lord .
These are clear proofs from your Lord , and a guidance and mercy for a people who believe . &quot;
And when the Quran is recited , listen to it , and remain silent , that you may receive mercy .
And remember your Lord in your hearts humbly and fearfully , without loud words in the morning and in the evening , and do not be of the heedless .
Indeed , those who are with your Lord are not too proud to serve Him ; they praise Him and prostrate themselves to Him .
They ask you about the spoils of war .
Say : The spoils are for Allah and the Messenger .
So fear Allah and keep your affairs in harmony , and obey Allah and His Messenger , if ye are ( true ) believers . &quot;
Indeed , those who , when Allah is mentioned , their hearts tremble and their faith is strengthened when His verses are recited to them , and those who put their trust in their Lord .
Those are the ones who establish prayer and spend from what We have given them .
These are the true believers .
They have a high standing with their Lord , and forgiveness , and an honourable provision .
This is just as your Lord brought you out of your home with justice , while a party of the believers disliked it .
They dispute with you about the truth after it has become clear , as if they were being driven to death with their eyes wide open .
And ( as for ) Allah promised you ( of ) one of the two hosts that it would fall to you , and you wished that that which had no power of struggle was for you ; but Allah desires that the truth be accomplished by His Words and that the root of the disbelievers be cut off ; and Allah desires that the root of the disbelievers be cut off .
so that He may bring the truth to the surface and bring the falsehood to naught , however much the guilty may be averse .
When you appealed to your Lord for help , He answered you , and said , &quot; I will assist you with a thousand angels , one after another . &quot;
Allah did not say this other but as a good news , so that your hearts might be at rest ; and help is only from Allah ; surely Allah is Exalted , Wise .
Then He sent down upon you the sleep as a reassurance from Him , and He sent down water from the cloud upon you that He might purify you with it , and take away from you the pollution of Satan , that He might strengthen your hearts , and make your feet firm .
So your Lord inspired the angels , &quot; I am with you , so strengthen the believers .
