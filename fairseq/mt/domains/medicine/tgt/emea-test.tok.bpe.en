What is A@@ bili@@ fy ?
A@@ bili@@ fy is a medicine containing the active substance ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
It is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as an oral solution ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a solution for injection ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
What is A@@ bili@@ fy used for ?
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat adults with the following mental ill@@ nesses : • sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , a mental illness with a number of symptoms , including dis@@ organised thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not there ) , susp@@ ici@@ ousness and del@@ u@@ sions ( mist@@ aken beliefs ) ; • bi@@ pol@@ ar I dis@@ order , a mental illness in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of ab@@ normally high mood ) , altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood .
They may also have episodes of depression .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
The solution for injection is used for the rapid control of ag@@ itation or distur@@ bed behaviour when taking the medicine by mouth is not appropriate .
The medicine can only be obtained with a pres@@ cription .
How is A@@ bili@@ fy used ?
For sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , the recommended starting dose is 10 or 15 mg by mouth per day .
The maintenance dose is 15 mg once a day , but higher d@@ oses may benefit some patients .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
For both ill@@ nesses , the oral solution or or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
The or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablets are taken by being placed on the tongue , where they dis@@ integrate quickly in the s@@ ali@@ va , or by mixing them in water before swal@@ lowing .
The solution for injection is only for short-@@ term use and should be replaced by tablets , or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablets or oral solution as soon as possible : the usual dose is 9.@@ 75 mg as a single injection into the upper arm or but@@ to@@ ck muscle , but effective d@@ oses range between 5.@@ 25 and 15 mg .

A@@ bili@@ fy can be taken with or without food .
The daily dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should not exceed 30 mg , but this dose should be used with cau@@ tion in patients who have severe problems with their liver .
The dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted in patients who are taking other medicines that are broken down in the same way as A@@ bili@@ fy .
A@@ bili@@ fy has not been studied in children aged below 18 years or adults aged over 65 years .
For more information , see the Package Le@@ af@@ let .
How does A@@ bili@@ fy work ?
The active substance in A@@ bili@@ fy , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , is an anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicine .
Its exact mechanism of action is unknown , but it att@@ aches to several different rec@@ ept@@ ors on the surface of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
This dis@@ rup@@ ts signals transmitted between brain cells by ‘ neuro@@ transm@@ it@@ ters ’ , chemicals that allow ner@@ ve cells to communicate with each other .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is thought to act mainly by being a ‘ partial agon@@ ist ’ for the rec@@ ept@@ ors for the neuro@@ transm@@ it@@ ters d@@ op@@ am@@ ine and 5-@@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
This means that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5-@@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine and d@@ op@@ am@@ ine to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors , but to a less@@ er extent than the neuro@@ transm@@ it@@ ters .
Since d@@ op@@ am@@ ine and 5-@@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine are involved in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alise the activity of the brain , reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing them from returning .
How has A@@ bili@@ fy been studied ?
For the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , there were three main short-@@ term studies of A@@ bili@@ fy tablets lasting four to six weeks , which involved 1,@@ 20@@ 3 patients and compared A@@ bili@@ fy with plac@@ eb@@ o ( a dum@@ my treatment ) .
The effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in preventing symptoms from returning was assess@@ ed in three studies lasting up to a year , two of which used hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicine ) as a compar@@ ator .
The effectiveness of the solution for injection was compared with plac@@ eb@@ o over a period of two hours in two studies involving 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia or related conditions who were experiencing symptoms of ag@@ itation .
All of the studies measured the change in the patient ’ s symptoms using a standard scale for sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
For the treatment of bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order , there were eight main studies looking at A@@ bili@@ fy taken by mouth .
There were five short-@@ term studies that compared the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ eb@@ o over three weeks in a total of 1,@@ 900 patients .
Two of these studies used hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l and li@@ th@@ ium ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicine ) as compar@@ ators and continued for a further nine weeks to look at the maintenance of the effect of the medicines .
Another study compared A@@ bili@@ fy with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l over 12 weeks in 3@@ 47 patients , and a further study compared the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence in 160 patients whose man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed using A@@ bili@@ fy .
The eigh@@ th study looked at the effect of adding A@@ bili@@ fy or plac@@ eb@@ o to existing treatment with li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicine ) in 38@@ 4 patients .
The effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy solution for injection was compared with that of lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicine ) and of plac@@ eb@@ o over a period of two hours in one study involving 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order who were experiencing symptoms of ag@@ itation .
All of these studies looked at the change in symptoms using a standard scale for bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order or at the number of patients who responded to treatment .
The company also carried out studies looking at the absor@@ ption of the or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablets and oral solution by the body .
What benefit has A@@ bili@@ fy shown during the studies ?
When used to treat sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , A@@ bili@@ fy was more effective than plac@@ eb@@ o in the short-@@ term studies .
In the long-term studies , A@@ bili@@ fy was more effective than plac@@ eb@@ o , and as effective as hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , after up to a year of treatment .
In both studies of the solution for injection , patients receiving A@@ bili@@ fy at d@@ oses of 5.@@ 25 , 9.@@ 75 or 15 mg had a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of ag@@ itation than those receiving plac@@ eb@@ o .
When used to treat bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order , A@@ bili@@ fy was more effective than plac@@ eb@@ o at reducing man@@ ic symptoms in four of the five short-@@ term studies .
A@@ bili@@ fy also had a similar effect to hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l and to li@@ th@@ ium over three weeks .
This effect was maintained for up to 12 weeks .
A@@ bili@@ fy was also more effective than plac@@ eb@@ o at preventing man@@ ic episodes returning in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks , and when it was used as an add-@@ on to existing treatment .
In@@ j@@ ections of A@@ bili@@ fy at d@@ oses of 10 or 15 mg were also more effective than plac@@ eb@@ o in reducing the symptoms of ag@@ itation , and were of similar effectiveness to lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
2 / 3 What is the risk associated with A@@ bili@@ fy ?
The most common side effects when taking A@@ bili@@ fy by mouth ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) are extra@@ py@@ ram@@ id@@ al dis@@ order ( un@@ controlled tw@@ it@@ ching or jer@@ king ) , ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia ( constant urge to move ) , tre@@ m@@ or ( sh@@ aking ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , se@@ dation ( d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess ) , head@@ ache , bl@@ urred vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( hear@@ t@@ burn ) , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( feeling sick ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , s@@ ali@@ vary hy@@ persec@@ re@@ tion ( increased production of s@@ ali@@ va ) , f@@ ati@@ gue ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( difficulty sleeping ) and an@@ xi@@ ety .
Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia is more common in patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order than in those with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
Between 1 and 10 patients in 100 receiving inj@@ ections of A@@ bili@@ fy experience som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
For the full list of all side effects reported with A@@ bili@@ fy , see the Package Le@@ af@@ let .
A@@ bili@@ fy should not be used in people who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( aller@@ gic ) to ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole or any of the other ingredients .
Why has A@@ bili@@ fy been approved ?
The Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) decided that A@@ bili@@ fy ’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ pol@@ ar I dis@@ order , and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who experienced pre@@ domin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes responded to ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole treatment .
It also decided that the benefits of the solution for injection out@@ weigh@@ ed its risks for the rapid control of ag@@ itation and distur@@ bed behavi@@ ours in patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ pol@@ ar I dis@@ order , when oral therapy is not appropriate .
The Committee recommended that A@@ bili@@ fy be given marketing author@@ isation .

4.1 Therap@@ eu@@ tic indic@@ ations
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who experienced pre@@ domin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes responded to ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Pos@@ ology and method of administration
Or@@ al use .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
Enh@@ anced eff@@ ic@@ acy at d@@ oses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Man@@ ic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals as mon@@ o@@ therapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence prevention of man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
For preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have been receiving ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Ad@@ just@@ ments of daily dos@@ age , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents : there is no experience in children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years of age .
Pati@@ ents with h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment .
In patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment , the data available are in@@ sufficient to establish recommendations .
However , the
2 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Pati@@ ents with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required in patients with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment .
El@@ derly : the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ rant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metaboli@@ c path@@ way of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itors with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itor is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be increased .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ er is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Con@@ tra@@ indic@@ ations
Hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or to any of the ex@@ cip@@ i@@ ents .
4.4 Special war@@ nings and prec@@ au@@ tions for use
During anti@@ psycho@@ tic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Pati@@ ents should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurr@@ ence of su@@ ic@@ id@@ al behaviour is inher@@ ent in psycho@@ tic ill@@ nesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initi@@ ation or switch of anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , including treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Close supervision of high-@@ risk patients should accompany anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy .
Results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of su@@ ic@@ id@@ ality with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics among patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order .
Cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disorders :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease ( history of my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , or conduc@@ tion ab@@ norm@@ alities ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions which would pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to h@@ yp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , and treatment with anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive medic@@ ations ) or hyper@@ tension , including acceler@@ ated or mal@@ ign@@ ant .
Con@@ duction ab@@ norm@@ alities :
In clinical trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the inci@@ dence of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation was comparable to plac@@ eb@@ o .
As with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with a family history of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation .
Tar@@ dive Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were un@@ common reports of treatment emerg@@ ent dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
If signs and symptoms of tar@@ dive dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appear in a patient on AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , dose reduction or dis@@ continu@@ ation should be considered .
These symptoms can tempor@@ ally deteri@@ or@@ ate or can even arise after dis@@ continu@@ ation of treatment .
Neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic Mal@@ ign@@ ant Syn@@ drome ( N@@ MS ) :
N@@ MS is a potentially fat@@ al sy@@ mp@@ tom complex associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of N@@ MS were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
3 mental status and evidence of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pul@@ se or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ ap@@ hor@@ esis and cardi@@ ac d@@ ys@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ia ) .
Additional signs may include elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase , my@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ur@@ ia ( r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis ) , and ac@@ ute ren@@ al failure .
However , elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase and r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , not necessarily in association with N@@ MS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of N@@ MS , or presents with un@@ explained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifest@@ ations of N@@ MS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be dis@@ continued .
Sei@@ z@@ ure : in clinical trials , un@@ common cases of sei@@ z@@ ure were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Therefore , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients who have a history of sei@@ z@@ ure dis@@ order or have conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
El@@ derly patients with de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis :
Incre@@ ased mort@@ ality : in three plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials ( n = 9@@ 38 ; mean age :
8@@ 2.4 years ; range :
5@@ 6-@@ 99 years ) of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alz@@ heimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were at increased risk of death compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
The rate of death in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the plac@@ eb@@ o group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or inf@@ ec@@ tious ( e. g. pneum@@ onia ) in nature .
Cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events : in the same trials , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events ( e. g. stroke , transi@@ ent isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic attack ) , including fat@@ alities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
84 years ; range :
7@@ 8-@@ 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients reported cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events compared with 0.@@ 6 % of plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statisti@@ cally significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fix@@ ed-@@ dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events in patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is not approved for the treatment of de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis .
Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and Diabetes M@@ elli@@ tus : hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , has been reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
Risk factors that may pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to severe complic@@ ations include o@@ bes@@ ity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there were no significant differences in the inci@@ dence rates of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events ( including diabetes ) or in ab@@ normal gly@@ ca@@ emia laboratory values compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
Prec@@ ise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events in patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and with other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents are not available to allow direct comparis@@ ons .
Pati@@ ents treated with any anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( such as poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weak@@ ness ) and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly for wor@@ sen@@ ing of glu@@ c@@ ose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic and bi@@ pol@@ ar man@@ ia patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics known to cause weight gain , poor@@ ly managed life-@@ style , and might lead to severe complic@@ ations .
Weight gain has been reported post-@@ marketing among patients prescri@@ bed AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , th@@ y@@ ro@@ id dis@@ order or p@@ itu@@ itary aden@@ oma .
In clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia : o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al d@@ ys@@ mo@@ tility and asp@@ ir@@ ation have been associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug use , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and other anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients at risk for asp@@ ir@@ ation pneum@@ onia .
L@@ act@@ ose : patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary problems of gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , the l@@ app l@@ act@@ ase defic@@ i@@ ency or glu@@ cos@@ e-@@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absor@@ ption should not take this medic@@ inal product .
Hyper@@ sensitivity : as with other medic@@ ations hyper@@ sensitivity reactions , characterised by aller@@ gic symptoms , may occur with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
4 4.5 Inter@@ action with other medic@@ inal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-@@ ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c recep@@ tor ant@@ agon@@ ism , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive agents .
Given the primary CN@@ S effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , cau@@ tion should be used when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CN@@ S medic@@ inal products with over@@ l@@ apping undes@@ irable effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
If ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with medicines known to cause Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation or elec@@ trol@@ yte im@@ balance , cau@@ tion should be used .
Potential for other medic@@ inal products to affect AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y :
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , the H@@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ d@@ ine , reduces ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole rate of absor@@ ption but this effect is deemed not clin@@ ically relevant .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is metaboli@@ sed by multiple path@@ ways involving the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 enz@@ y@@ mes but not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A enz@@ y@@ mes .
Thus , no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C by 107 % , while C@@ max was un@@ changed .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y with qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine occurs .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C and C@@ max by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 poor metaboli@@ sers , con@@ com@@ it@@ ant use of pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may result in higher plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to that in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metaboli@@ z@@ ers .
When considering con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , potential benefits should out@@ wei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ o@@ z@@ ole with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV pro@@ tease in@@ hib@@ itors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itor , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the level prior to the initi@@ ation of the con@@ com@@ it@@ ant therapy .
When weak in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( e. g . , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are used con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , mod@@ est increases in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations might be expected .
Following con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , a pot@@ ent in@@ duc@@ er of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the geomet@@ ric means of C@@ max and AU@@ C for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 30 mg ) was administ@@ ered alone .
Simil@@ arly , for de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole the geomet@@ ric means of C@@ max and AU@@ C after carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine co-@@ administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be dou@@ bled when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs with carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine .
John &apos;s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be reduced to the recommended dose .
5 When either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium were administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there was no clin@@ ically significant change in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations .
Potential for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to affect other medic@@ inal products :
In clinical studies , 10-@@ 30 mg / day d@@ oses of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had no significant effect on the metabolism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3-@@ metho@@ xy@@ mor@@ ph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ) , and 3@@ A4 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
Additionally , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not show potential for alter@@ ing C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A@@ 2-@@ medi@@ ated metabolism in vit@@ ro .
Thus , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is un@@ likely to cause clin@@ ically important medic@@ inal product inter@@ actions medi@@ ated by these enz@@ y@@ mes .
When ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium , there was no clin@@ ically important change in val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium concentr@@ ations .
4.@@ 6 Pre@@ gn@@ ancy and lac@@ tation
There are no adequate and well-@@ controlled trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclu@@ de potential develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity ( see section 5.@@ 3 ) .
Pati@@ ents should be advised to noti@@ fy their physi@@ cian if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Due to in@@ sufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal re@@ productive studies , this medic@@ inal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk to the fo@@ etus .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was ex@@ cre@@ ted in the milk of treated rats during lac@@ tation .
Pati@@ ents should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
4.@@ 7 Eff@@ ects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be cau@@ tioned about operating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reason@@ ably certain that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole does not affect them ad@@ ver@@ sely .
4.@@ 8 Un@@ des@@ irable effects
The following undes@@ irable effects occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ eb@@ o , or were identified as possibly medi@@ cally relevant ad@@ verse reactions ( * ) :

6 Extra@@ py@@ ram@@ id@@ al symptoms ( EP@@ S ) :
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia - in a long term 5@@ 2-@@ week controlled trial , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients had an over@@ all-@@ lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EP@@ S including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared with those treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
In a long term 26@@ -@@ week plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 19 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 13@@ .1 % for plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients .
In another long-term 26@@ -@@ week controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 14.@@ 8 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 15@@ .1 % for ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine-@@ treated patients .
Man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order - in a 12-@@ week controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 2@@ 3.5 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 5@@ 3.3 % for hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol@@ -@@ treated patients .
In another 12-@@ week trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 26.@@ 6 % for patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those treated with li@@ th@@ ium .
In the long term 26@@ -@@ week maintenance phase of a plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 18.@@ 2 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients .
In plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials , the inci@@ dence of ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia in bi@@ pol@@ ar patients was 12.@@ 1 % with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 3.2 % with plac@@ eb@@ o .
In sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia patients the inci@@ dence of ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia was 6.2 % with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 3.0 % with plac@@ eb@@ o .
Compar@@ is@@ ons between ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ eb@@ o in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally important differences .
Elev@@ ations of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ ine Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ omati@@ c , were observed in 3.5 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received plac@@ eb@@ o .

4.@@ 9 Over@@ dose
In clinical trials and post-@@ marketing experience , acci@@ dental or inten@@ tional ac@@ ute over@@ dos@@ age of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated d@@ oses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fat@@ alities .
The potentially medi@@ cally important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , increased blood pressure , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea .
In addition , reports of acci@@ dental over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fat@@ alities .
The potentially medi@@ cally serious signs and symptoms reported included som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , transi@@ ent loss of consciousness and extra@@ py@@ ram@@ id@@ al symptoms .
Management of over@@ dose should concentrate on sup@@ por@@ tive therapy , maintaining an adequate air@@ way , oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ventil@@ ation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medic@@ inal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electro@@ cardi@@ ographic monitoring to detect possible ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
Following any confirmed or susp@@ ected over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient re@@ covers .
Activ@@ ated char@@ coal ( 50 g ) , administ@@ ered one hour after ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , decreased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole C@@ max by about 41 % and AU@@ C by about 51 % , suggest@@ ing that char@@ coal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose .
Although there is no information on the effect of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in tre@@ ating an over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is un@@ likely to be useful in over@@ dose management since ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is highly bound to plas@@ ma proteins .

8 It has been proposed that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ’ s eff@@ ic@@ acy in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order is medi@@ ated through a combination of partial agon@@ ism at d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 2 and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and ant@@ agon@@ ism of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole exhib@@ ited ant@@ agon@@ ist properties in animal models of d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ ergi@@ c hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ ergi@@ c hypo@@ activity .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole exhib@@ ited high binding aff@@ inity in vit@@ ro for d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and moderate aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 4 , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , alp@@ ha@@ -1 ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ am@@ ine H@@ 1 rec@@ ept@@ ors .

Inter@@ action with rec@@ ept@@ ors other than d@@ op@@ am@@ ine and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in sub@@ types may explain some of the other clinical effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole d@@ oses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administ@@ ered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dos@@ e-@@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C-@@ rac@@ lo@@ pride , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ and , to the cau@@ date and put@@ amen detected by pos@@ it@@ ron emission tom@@ ography .
Further information on clinical trials :
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia :
In three short-@@ term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials involving 1,@@ 2@@ 28 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was associated with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol@@ -@@ controlled trial , the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medic@@ inal product at 5@@ 2-@@ weeks was similar in both groups ( ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 43 % ) than for hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 30 % ) .
Ac@@ tual scores in rating sc@@ ales used as secondary end@@ points , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ y-@@ As@@ berg Depression Rating Sc@@ ale showed a significant improvement over hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial in stabili@@ sed patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate , 34 % in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in plac@@ eb@@ o .
Weight gain : in clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine-@@ controlled , double-@@ blind , multi-@@ national study of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia which included 3@@ 14 patients and where the primary end-@@ point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over bas@@ eline ( i@@ . e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean bas@@ eline weight of ~ 8@@ 0.5 kg ) on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 , or 13 % of evalu@@ able patients ) , compared to ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine ( N = 45 , or 33 % of evalu@@ able patients ) .
Man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
In two 3-@@ week , flexi@@ b@@ le-@@ dose , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trials involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psycho@@ tic features and with or without a rap@@ id-@@ cycling course .
In one 3-@@ week , fix@@ ed-@@ dose , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trial involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole failed to demonstrate superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o .
In two 12-@@ week , plac@@ ebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trials in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , with or without psycho@@ tic features , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to li@@ th@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l at week 12 .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in sympt@@ omati@@ c re@@ mission from man@@ ia as li@@ th@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l at week 12 .
In a 6-@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , with or without psycho@@ tic features , who were partially non-@@ respon@@ sive to li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ o@@ therapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic ser@@ um levels , the addition of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resulted in superior eff@@ ic@@ acy in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms than li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ o@@ therapy .
9 In a 26@@ -@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week extension , in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated su@@ peri@@ ority over plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing bi@@ pol@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence , primarily in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into man@@ ia but failed to demonstrate su@@ peri@@ ority over plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into depression .
5.2 Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ ption :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is well absor@@ bed , with peak plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations occurr@@ ing within 3-5 hours after d@@ osing .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole under@@ goes minimal pre-@@ system@@ ic metabolism .
The absolute oral bio@@ availability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Distribution :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.@@ 9 l / kg , indic@@ ating extensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution .
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole are greater than 99 % bound to ser@@ um proteins , binding primarily to alb@@ um@@ in .
Met@@ aboli@@ sm :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is exten@@ sively metaboli@@ sed by the liver primarily by three bi@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation path@@ ways : de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation , hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation , and N-@@ deal@@ k@@ yl@@ ation .
Based on in vit@@ ro studies , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enz@@ y@@ mes are responsible for de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation and hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , and N-@@ deal@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cat@@ aly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is the pre@@ dominant medic@@ inal product mo@@ i@@ ety in system@@ ic circulation .
At ste@@ ady state , de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , represents about 40 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C in plas@@ ma .
Eli@@ min@@ ation :
The mean elim@@ ination half-@@ lives for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metaboli@@ sers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours in poor metaboli@@ sers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
The total body clear@@ ance of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is 0.@@ 7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily h@@ ep@@ atic .
Following a single oral dose of &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ lab@@ elled ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , approximately 27 % of the administ@@ ered radio@@ activity was recovered in the ur@@ ine and approximately 60 % in the fa@@ eces .
Less than 1 % of un@@ changed ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was ex@@ cre@@ ted in the ur@@ ine and approximately 18 % was recovered un@@ changed in the fa@@ eces .
Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics in special patient groups
El@@ derly :
There are no differences in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any det@@ ec@@ table effect of age in a population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients .
Gender :
There are no differences in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any det@@ ec@@ table effect of gender in a population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients .
Smoking and Race :
Population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clin@@ ically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smoking upon the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Ren@@ al Dis@@ ease :
The ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were found to be similar in patients with severe ren@@ al disease compared to young healthy subjects .
10 H@@ ep@@ atic Dis@@ ease :
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ ying degrees of liver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis ( Chil@@ d-@@ Pu@@ gh Cl@@ asses A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis , which is in@@ sufficient to draw conclusions on their metaboli@@ c capacity .
5.@@ 3 Prec@@ lin@@ ical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special haz@@ ard for humans based on conventional studies of safety ph@@ armac@@ ology , repe@@ at-@@ dose tox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , and tox@@ ic@@ ity to reproduction .
To@@ x@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only at d@@ oses or expos@@ ures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indic@@ ating that these effects were limited or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use .
These included : dos@@ e-@@ dependent ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical tox@@ ic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ in pig@@ ment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 3 to 10 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical car@@ cin@@ omas and combined ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical aden@@ omas / car@@ cin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest n@@ ont@@ um@@ orig@@ en@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a consequence of precipitation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy metaboli@@ tes of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in the b@@ ile of mon@@ keys after repeated oral d@@ osing at 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg / m2 ) .
However , the concentr@@ ations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in human b@@ ile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the b@@ ile concentr@@ ations found in the mon@@ keys in the 3@@ 9-@@ week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vit@@ ro sol@@ u@@ bility .
Based on results of a full range of standard gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was considered non-@@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not imp@@ air fer@@ tility in re@@ productive tox@@ ic@@ ity studies .
Develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity , including dos@@ e-@@ dependent del@@ ayed fo@@ etal ossi@@ fication and possible ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects , were observed in rats at d@@ oses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic expos@@ ures ( based on AU@@ C ) and in rab@@ bits at d@@ oses resulting in expos@@ ures 3 and 11 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Mat@@ ern@@ al tox@@ ic@@ ity occurred at d@@ oses similar to those el@@ ic@@ iting develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity .

4.1 Therap@@ eu@@ tic indic@@ ations
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who experienced pre@@ domin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes responded to ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Pos@@ ology and method of administration
Or@@ al use .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
Enh@@ anced eff@@ ic@@ acy at d@@ oses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Man@@ ic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals as mon@@ o@@ therapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence prevention of man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
For preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have been receiving ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Ad@@ just@@ ments of daily dos@@ age , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents : there is no experience in children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years of age .
Pati@@ ents with h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment .
In patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment , the data available are in@@ sufficient to establish recommendations .
However , the
13 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Pati@@ ents with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required in patients with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment .
El@@ derly : the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ rant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metaboli@@ c path@@ way of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itors with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itor is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be increased .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ er is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Con@@ tra@@ indic@@ ations
Hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or to any of the ex@@ cip@@ i@@ ents .
4.4 Special war@@ nings and prec@@ au@@ tions for use
During anti@@ psycho@@ tic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Pati@@ ents should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurr@@ ence of su@@ ic@@ id@@ al behaviour is inher@@ ent in psycho@@ tic ill@@ nesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initi@@ ation or switch of anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , including treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Close supervision of high-@@ risk patients should accompany anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy .
Results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of su@@ ic@@ id@@ ality with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics among patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order .
Cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disorders :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease ( history of my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , or conduc@@ tion ab@@ norm@@ alities ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions which would pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to h@@ yp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , and treatment with anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive medic@@ ations ) or hyper@@ tension , including acceler@@ ated or mal@@ ign@@ ant .
Con@@ duction ab@@ norm@@ alities :
In clinical trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the inci@@ dence of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation was comparable to plac@@ eb@@ o .
As with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with a family history of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation .
Tar@@ dive Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were un@@ common reports of treatment emerg@@ ent dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
If signs and symptoms of tar@@ dive dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appear in a patient on AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , dose reduction or dis@@ continu@@ ation should be considered .
These symptoms can tempor@@ ally deteri@@ or@@ ate or can even arise after dis@@ continu@@ ation of treatment .
Neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic Mal@@ ign@@ ant Syn@@ drome ( N@@ MS ) :
N@@ MS is a potentially fat@@ al sy@@ mp@@ tom complex associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of N@@ MS were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
14 mental status and evidence of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pul@@ se or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ ap@@ hor@@ esis and cardi@@ ac d@@ ys@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ia ) .
Additional signs may include elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase , my@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ur@@ ia ( r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis ) , and ac@@ ute ren@@ al failure .
However , elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase and r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , not necessarily in association with N@@ MS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of N@@ MS , or presents with un@@ explained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifest@@ ations of N@@ MS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be dis@@ continued .
Sei@@ z@@ ure : in clinical trials , un@@ common cases of sei@@ z@@ ure were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Therefore , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients who have a history of sei@@ z@@ ure dis@@ order or have conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
El@@ derly patients with de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis :
Incre@@ ased mort@@ ality : in three plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials ( n = 9@@ 38 ; mean age :
8@@ 2.4 years ; range :
5@@ 6-@@ 99 years ) of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alz@@ heimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were at increased risk of death compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
The rate of death in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the plac@@ eb@@ o group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or inf@@ ec@@ tious ( e. g. pneum@@ onia ) in nature .
Cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events : in the same trials , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events ( e. g. stroke , transi@@ ent isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic attack ) , including fat@@ alities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
84 years ; range :
7@@ 8-@@ 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients reported cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events compared with 0.@@ 6 % of plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statisti@@ cally significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fix@@ ed-@@ dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events in patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is not approved for the treatment of de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis .
Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and Diabetes M@@ elli@@ tus : hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , has been reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
Risk factors that may pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to severe complic@@ ations include o@@ bes@@ ity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there were no significant differences in the inci@@ dence rates of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events ( including diabetes ) or in ab@@ normal gly@@ ca@@ emia laboratory values compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
Prec@@ ise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events in patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and with other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents are not available to allow direct comparis@@ ons .
Pati@@ ents treated with any anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( such as poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weak@@ ness ) and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly for wor@@ sen@@ ing of glu@@ c@@ ose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic and bi@@ pol@@ ar man@@ ia patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics known to cause weight gain , poor@@ ly managed life-@@ style , and might lead to severe complic@@ ations .
Weight gain has been reported post-@@ marketing among patients prescri@@ bed AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , th@@ y@@ ro@@ id dis@@ order or p@@ itu@@ itary aden@@ oma .
In clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia : o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al d@@ ys@@ mo@@ tility and asp@@ ir@@ ation have been associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug use , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and other anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients at risk for asp@@ ir@@ ation pneum@@ onia .
L@@ act@@ ose : patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary problems of gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , the l@@ app l@@ act@@ ase defic@@ i@@ ency or glu@@ cos@@ e-@@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absor@@ ption should not take this medic@@ inal product .
Hyper@@ sensitivity : as with other medic@@ ations hyper@@ sensitivity reactions , characterised by aller@@ gic symptoms , may occur with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
15 4.5 Inter@@ action with other medic@@ inal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-@@ ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c recep@@ tor ant@@ agon@@ ism , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive agents .
Given the primary CN@@ S effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , cau@@ tion should be used when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CN@@ S medic@@ inal products with over@@ l@@ apping undes@@ irable effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
If ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with medicines known to cause Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation or elec@@ trol@@ yte im@@ balance , cau@@ tion should be used .
Potential for other medic@@ inal products to affect AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y :
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , the H@@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ d@@ ine , reduces ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole rate of absor@@ ption but this effect is deemed not clin@@ ically relevant .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is metaboli@@ sed by multiple path@@ ways involving the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 enz@@ y@@ mes but not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A enz@@ y@@ mes .
Thus , no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C by 107 % , while C@@ max was un@@ changed .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y with qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine occurs .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C and C@@ max by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 poor metaboli@@ sers , con@@ com@@ it@@ ant use of pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may result in higher plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to that in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metaboli@@ z@@ ers .
When considering con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , potential benefits should out@@ wei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ o@@ z@@ ole with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV pro@@ tease in@@ hib@@ itors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itor , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the level prior to the initi@@ ation of the con@@ com@@ it@@ ant therapy .
When weak in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( e. g . , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are used con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , mod@@ est increases in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations might be expected .
Following con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , a pot@@ ent in@@ duc@@ er of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the geomet@@ ric means of C@@ max and AU@@ C for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 30 mg ) was administ@@ ered alone .
Simil@@ arly , for de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole the geomet@@ ric means of C@@ max and AU@@ C after carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine co-@@ administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be dou@@ bled when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs with carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine .

Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be reduced to the recommended dose .
16 When either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium were administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there was no clin@@ ically significant change in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations .
Potential for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to affect other medic@@ inal products :
In clinical studies , 10-@@ 30 mg / day d@@ oses of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had no significant effect on the metabolism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3-@@ metho@@ xy@@ mor@@ ph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ) , and 3@@ A4 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
Additionally , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not show potential for alter@@ ing C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A@@ 2-@@ medi@@ ated metabolism in vit@@ ro .
Thus , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is un@@ likely to cause clin@@ ically important medic@@ inal product inter@@ actions medi@@ ated by these enz@@ y@@ mes .
When ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium , there was no clin@@ ically important change in val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium concentr@@ ations .
4.@@ 6 Pre@@ gn@@ ancy and lac@@ tation
There are no adequate and well-@@ controlled trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclu@@ de potential develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity ( see section 5.@@ 3 ) .
Pati@@ ents should be advised to noti@@ fy their physi@@ cian if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Due to in@@ sufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal re@@ productive studies , this medic@@ inal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk to the fo@@ etus .

4.@@ 7 Eff@@ ects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be cau@@ tioned about operating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reason@@ ably certain that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole does not affect them ad@@ ver@@ sely .

In plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials , the inci@@ dence of ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia in bi@@ pol@@ ar patients was 12.@@ 1 % with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 3.2 % with plac@@ eb@@ o .
In sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia patients the inci@@ dence of ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia was 6.2 % with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 3.0 % with plac@@ eb@@ o .
Compar@@ is@@ ons between ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ eb@@ o in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally important differences .
Elev@@ ations of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ ine Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ omati@@ c , were observed in 3.5 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received plac@@ eb@@ o .

4.@@ 9 Over@@ dose
In clinical trials and post-@@ marketing experience , acci@@ dental or inten@@ tional ac@@ ute over@@ dos@@ age of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated d@@ oses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fat@@ alities .
The potentially medi@@ cally important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , increased blood pressure , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea .
In addition , reports of acci@@ dental over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fat@@ alities .
The potentially medi@@ cally serious signs and symptoms reported included som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , transi@@ ent loss of consciousness and extra@@ py@@ ram@@ id@@ al symptoms .
Management of over@@ dose should concentrate on sup@@ por@@ tive therapy , maintaining an adequate air@@ way , oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ventil@@ ation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medic@@ inal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electro@@ cardi@@ ographic monitoring to detect possible ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
Following any confirmed or susp@@ ected over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient re@@ covers .
Activ@@ ated char@@ coal ( 50 g ) , administ@@ ered one hour after ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , decreased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole C@@ max by about 41 % and AU@@ C by about 51 % , suggest@@ ing that char@@ coal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose .
Although there is no information on the effect of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in tre@@ ating an over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is un@@ likely to be useful in over@@ dose management since ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is highly bound to plas@@ ma proteins .

19 It has been proposed that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ’ s eff@@ ic@@ acy in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order is medi@@ ated through a combination of partial agon@@ ism at d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 2 and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and ant@@ agon@@ ism of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole exhib@@ ited ant@@ agon@@ ist properties in animal models of d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ ergi@@ c hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ ergi@@ c hypo@@ activity .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole exhib@@ ited high binding aff@@ inity in vit@@ ro for d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and moderate aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 4 , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , alp@@ ha@@ -1 ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ am@@ ine H@@ 1 rec@@ ept@@ ors .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole also exhib@@ ited moderate binding aff@@ inity for the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in re@@ up@@ take site and no appreci@@ able aff@@ inity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic rec@@ ept@@ ors .
Inter@@ action with rec@@ ept@@ ors other than d@@ op@@ am@@ ine and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in sub@@ types may explain some of the other clinical effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole d@@ oses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administ@@ ered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dos@@ e-@@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C-@@ rac@@ lo@@ pride , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ and , to the cau@@ date and put@@ amen detected by pos@@ it@@ ron emission tom@@ ography .
Further information on clinical trials :
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia :
In three short-@@ term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials involving 1,@@ 2@@ 28 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was associated with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol@@ -@@ controlled trial , the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medic@@ inal product at 5@@ 2-@@ weeks was similar in both groups ( ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 43 % ) than for hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 30 % ) .
Ac@@ tual scores in rating sc@@ ales used as secondary end@@ points , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ y-@@ As@@ berg Depression Rating Sc@@ ale showed a significant improvement over hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial in stabili@@ sed patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate , 34 % in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in plac@@ eb@@ o .
Weight gain : in clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine-@@ controlled , double-@@ blind , multi-@@ national study of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia which included 3@@ 14 patients and where the primary end-@@ point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over bas@@ eline ( i@@ . e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean bas@@ eline weight of ~ 8@@ 0.5 kg ) on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 , or 13 % of evalu@@ able patients ) , compared to ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine ( N = 45 , or 33 % of evalu@@ able patients ) .
Man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
In two 3-@@ week , flexi@@ b@@ le-@@ dose , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trials involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psycho@@ tic features and with or without a rap@@ id-@@ cycling course .
In one 3-@@ week , fix@@ ed-@@ dose , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trial involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole failed to demonstrate superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o .
In two 12-@@ week , plac@@ ebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trials in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , with or without psycho@@ tic features , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to li@@ th@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l at week 12 .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in sympt@@ omati@@ c re@@ mission from man@@ ia as li@@ th@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l at week 12 .
In a 6-@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , with or without psycho@@ tic features , who were partially non-@@ respon@@ sive to li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ o@@ therapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic ser@@ um levels , the addition of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resulted in superior eff@@ ic@@ acy in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms than li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ o@@ therapy .
20 In a 26@@ -@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week extension , in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated su@@ peri@@ ority over plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing bi@@ pol@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence , primarily in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into man@@ ia but failed to demonstrate su@@ peri@@ ority over plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into depression .
5.2 Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ ption :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is well absor@@ bed , with peak plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations occurr@@ ing within 3-5 hours after d@@ osing .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole under@@ goes minimal pre-@@ system@@ ic metabolism .
The absolute oral bio@@ availability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Distribution :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.@@ 9 l / kg , indic@@ ating extensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution .
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole are greater than 99 % bound to ser@@ um proteins , binding primarily to alb@@ um@@ in .
Met@@ aboli@@ sm :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is exten@@ sively metaboli@@ sed by the liver primarily by three bi@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation path@@ ways : de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation , hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation , and N-@@ deal@@ k@@ yl@@ ation .
Based on in vit@@ ro studies , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enz@@ y@@ mes are responsible for de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation and hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , and N-@@ deal@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cat@@ aly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is the pre@@ dominant medic@@ inal product mo@@ i@@ ety in system@@ ic circulation .
At ste@@ ady state , de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , represents about 40 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C in plas@@ ma .
Eli@@ min@@ ation :
The mean elim@@ ination half-@@ lives for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metaboli@@ sers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours in poor metaboli@@ sers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
The total body clear@@ ance of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is 0.@@ 7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily h@@ ep@@ atic .
Following a single oral dose of &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ lab@@ elled ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , approximately 27 % of the administ@@ ered radio@@ activity was recovered in the ur@@ ine and approximately 60 % in the fa@@ eces .
Less than 1 % of un@@ changed ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was ex@@ cre@@ ted in the ur@@ ine and approximately 18 % was recovered un@@ changed in the fa@@ eces .
Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics in special patient groups
El@@ derly :
There are no differences in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any det@@ ec@@ table effect of age in a population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients .
Gender :
There are no differences in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any det@@ ec@@ table effect of gender in a population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients .
Smoking and Race :
Population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clin@@ ically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smoking upon the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Ren@@ al Dis@@ ease :
The ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were found to be similar in patients with severe ren@@ al disease compared to young healthy subjects .
21 H@@ ep@@ atic Dis@@ ease :
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ ying degrees of liver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis ( Chil@@ d-@@ Pu@@ gh Cl@@ asses A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis , which is in@@ sufficient to draw conclusions on their metaboli@@ c capacity .
5.@@ 3 Prec@@ lin@@ ical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special haz@@ ard for humans based on conventional studies of safety ph@@ armac@@ ology , repe@@ at-@@ dose tox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , and tox@@ ic@@ ity to reproduction .
To@@ x@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only at d@@ oses or expos@@ ures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indic@@ ating that these effects were limited or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use .
These included : dos@@ e-@@ dependent ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical tox@@ ic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ in pig@@ ment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 3 to 10 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical car@@ cin@@ omas and combined ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical aden@@ omas / car@@ cin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest n@@ ont@@ um@@ orig@@ en@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a consequence of precipitation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy metaboli@@ tes of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in the b@@ ile of mon@@ keys after repeated oral d@@ osing at 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg / m2 ) .
However , the concentr@@ ations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in human b@@ ile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the b@@ ile concentr@@ ations found in the mon@@ keys in the 3@@ 9-@@ week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vit@@ ro sol@@ u@@ bility .
Based on results of a full range of standard gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was considered non-@@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not imp@@ air fer@@ tility in re@@ productive tox@@ ic@@ ity studies .
Develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity , including dos@@ e-@@ dependent del@@ ayed fo@@ etal ossi@@ fication and possible ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects , were observed in rats at d@@ oses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic expos@@ ures ( based on AU@@ C ) and in rab@@ bits at d@@ oses resulting in expos@@ ures 3 and 11 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Mat@@ ern@@ al tox@@ ic@@ ity occurred at d@@ oses similar to those el@@ ic@@ iting develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity .

4.1 Therap@@ eu@@ tic indic@@ ations
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who experienced pre@@ domin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes responded to ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Pos@@ ology and method of administration
Or@@ al use .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
Enh@@ anced eff@@ ic@@ acy at d@@ oses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Man@@ ic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals as mon@@ o@@ therapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence prevention of man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
For preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have been receiving ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Ad@@ just@@ ments of daily dos@@ age , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents : there is no experience in children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years of age .
Pati@@ ents with h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment .
In patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment , the data available are in@@ sufficient to establish recommendations .
However , the
24 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Pati@@ ents with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required in patients with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment .
El@@ derly : the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ rant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metaboli@@ c path@@ way of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itors with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itor is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be increased .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ er is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Con@@ tra@@ indic@@ ations
Hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or to any of the ex@@ cip@@ i@@ ents .
4.4 Special war@@ nings and prec@@ au@@ tions for use
During anti@@ psycho@@ tic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Pati@@ ents should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurr@@ ence of su@@ ic@@ id@@ al behaviour is inher@@ ent in psycho@@ tic ill@@ nesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initi@@ ation or switch of anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , including treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Close supervision of high-@@ risk patients should accompany anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy .
Results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of su@@ ic@@ id@@ ality with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics among patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order .
Cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disorders :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease ( history of my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , or conduc@@ tion ab@@ norm@@ alities ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions which would pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to h@@ yp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , and treatment with anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive medic@@ ations ) or hyper@@ tension , including acceler@@ ated or mal@@ ign@@ ant .
Con@@ duction ab@@ norm@@ alities :
In clinical trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the inci@@ dence of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation was comparable to plac@@ eb@@ o .
As with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with a family history of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation .
Tar@@ dive Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were un@@ common reports of treatment emerg@@ ent dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
If signs and symptoms of tar@@ dive dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appear in a patient on AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , dose reduction or dis@@ continu@@ ation should be considered .
These symptoms can tempor@@ ally deteri@@ or@@ ate or can even arise after dis@@ continu@@ ation of treatment .
Neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic Mal@@ ign@@ ant Syn@@ drome ( N@@ MS ) :
N@@ MS is a potentially fat@@ al sy@@ mp@@ tom complex associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of N@@ MS were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
25 mental status and evidence of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pul@@ se or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ ap@@ hor@@ esis and cardi@@ ac d@@ ys@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ia ) .
Additional signs may include elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase , my@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ur@@ ia ( r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis ) , and ac@@ ute ren@@ al failure .
However , elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase and r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , not necessarily in association with N@@ MS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of N@@ MS , or presents with un@@ explained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifest@@ ations of N@@ MS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be dis@@ continued .
Sei@@ z@@ ure : in clinical trials , un@@ common cases of sei@@ z@@ ure were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Therefore , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients who have a history of sei@@ z@@ ure dis@@ order or have conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
El@@ derly patients with de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis :
Incre@@ ased mort@@ ality : in three plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials ( n = 9@@ 38 ; mean age :
8@@ 2.4 years ; range :
5@@ 6-@@ 99 years ) of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alz@@ heimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were at increased risk of death compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
The rate of death in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the plac@@ eb@@ o group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or inf@@ ec@@ tious ( e. g. pneum@@ onia ) in nature .
Cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events : in the same trials , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events ( e. g. stroke , transi@@ ent isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic attack ) , including fat@@ alities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
84 years ; range :
7@@ 8-@@ 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients reported cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events compared with 0.@@ 6 % of plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statisti@@ cally significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fix@@ ed-@@ dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events in patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is not approved for the treatment of de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis .
Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and Diabetes M@@ elli@@ tus : hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , has been reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
Risk factors that may pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to severe complic@@ ations include o@@ bes@@ ity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there were no significant differences in the inci@@ dence rates of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events ( including diabetes ) or in ab@@ normal gly@@ ca@@ emia laboratory values compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
Prec@@ ise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events in patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and with other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents are not available to allow direct comparis@@ ons .
Pati@@ ents treated with any anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( such as poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weak@@ ness ) and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly for wor@@ sen@@ ing of glu@@ c@@ ose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic and bi@@ pol@@ ar man@@ ia patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics known to cause weight gain , poor@@ ly managed life-@@ style , and might lead to severe complic@@ ations .
Weight gain has been reported post-@@ marketing among patients prescri@@ bed AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , th@@ y@@ ro@@ id dis@@ order or p@@ itu@@ itary aden@@ oma .
In clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia : o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al d@@ ys@@ mo@@ tility and asp@@ ir@@ ation have been associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug use , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and other anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients at risk for asp@@ ir@@ ation pneum@@ onia .
L@@ act@@ ose : patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary problems of gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , the l@@ app l@@ act@@ ase defic@@ i@@ ency or glu@@ cos@@ e-@@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absor@@ ption should not take this medic@@ inal product .
Hyper@@ sensitivity : as with other medic@@ ations hyper@@ sensitivity reactions , characterised by aller@@ gic symptoms , may occur with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
26 4.5 Inter@@ action with other medic@@ inal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-@@ ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c recep@@ tor ant@@ agon@@ ism , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive agents .
Given the primary CN@@ S effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , cau@@ tion should be used when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CN@@ S medic@@ inal products with over@@ l@@ apping undes@@ irable effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
If ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with medicines known to cause Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation or elec@@ trol@@ yte im@@ balance , cau@@ tion should be used .
Potential for other medic@@ inal products to affect AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y :
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , the H@@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ d@@ ine , reduces ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole rate of absor@@ ption but this effect is deemed not clin@@ ically relevant .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is metaboli@@ sed by multiple path@@ ways involving the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 enz@@ y@@ mes but not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A enz@@ y@@ mes .
Thus , no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C by 107 % , while C@@ max was un@@ changed .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y with qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine occurs .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C and C@@ max by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 poor metaboli@@ sers , con@@ com@@ it@@ ant use of pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may result in higher plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to that in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metaboli@@ z@@ ers .
When considering con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , potential benefits should out@@ wei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ o@@ z@@ ole with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV pro@@ tease in@@ hib@@ itors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itor , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the level prior to the initi@@ ation of the con@@ com@@ it@@ ant therapy .
When weak in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( e. g . , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are used con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , mod@@ est increases in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations might be expected .
Following con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , a pot@@ ent in@@ duc@@ er of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the geomet@@ ric means of C@@ max and AU@@ C for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 30 mg ) was administ@@ ered alone .
Simil@@ arly , for de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole the geomet@@ ric means of C@@ max and AU@@ C after carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine co-@@ administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be dou@@ bled when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs with carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine .
John &apos;s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be reduced to the recommended dose .
27 When either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium were administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there was no clin@@ ically significant change in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations .
Potential for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to affect other medic@@ inal products :
In clinical studies , 10-@@ 30 mg / day d@@ oses of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had no significant effect on the metabolism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3-@@ metho@@ xy@@ mor@@ ph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ) , and 3@@ A4 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
Additionally , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not show potential for alter@@ ing C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A@@ 2-@@ medi@@ ated metabolism in vit@@ ro .
Thus , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is un@@ likely to cause clin@@ ically important medic@@ inal product inter@@ actions medi@@ ated by these enz@@ y@@ mes .
When ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium , there was no clin@@ ically important change in val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium concentr@@ ations .
4.@@ 6 Pre@@ gn@@ ancy and lac@@ tation
There are no adequate and well-@@ controlled trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclu@@ de potential develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity ( see section 5.@@ 3 ) .
Pati@@ ents should be advised to noti@@ fy their physi@@ cian if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Due to in@@ sufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal re@@ productive studies , this medic@@ inal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk to the fo@@ etus .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was ex@@ cre@@ ted in the milk of treated rats during lac@@ tation .
Pati@@ ents should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
4.@@ 7 Eff@@ ects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be cau@@ tioned about operating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reason@@ ably certain that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole does not affect them ad@@ ver@@ sely .
4.@@ 8 Un@@ des@@ irable effects
The following undes@@ irable effects occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ eb@@ o , or were identified as possibly medi@@ cally relevant ad@@ verse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and un@@ common ( &gt; 1 / 1 , 000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .

28 Extra@@ py@@ ram@@ id@@ al symptoms ( EP@@ S ) :
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia - in a long term 5@@ 2-@@ week controlled trial , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients had an over@@ all-@@ lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EP@@ S including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared with those treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
In a long term 26@@ -@@ week plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 19 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 13@@ .1 % for plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients .
In another long-term 26@@ -@@ week controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 14.@@ 8 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 15@@ .1 % for ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine-@@ treated patients .
Man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order - in a 12-@@ week controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 2@@ 3.5 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 5@@ 3.3 % for hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol@@ -@@ treated patients .
In another 12-@@ week trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 26.@@ 6 % for patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those treated with li@@ th@@ ium .
In the long term 26@@ -@@ week maintenance phase of a plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 18.@@ 2 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients .
In plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials , the inci@@ dence of ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia in bi@@ pol@@ ar patients was 12.@@ 1 % with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 3.2 % with plac@@ eb@@ o .
In sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia patients the inci@@ dence of ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia was 6.2 % with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 3.0 % with plac@@ eb@@ o .
Compar@@ is@@ ons between ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ eb@@ o in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally important differences .
Elev@@ ations of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ ine Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ omati@@ c , were observed in 3.5 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received plac@@ eb@@ o .

In addition , reports of acci@@ dental over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fat@@ alities .
The potentially medi@@ cally serious signs and symptoms reported included som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , transi@@ ent loss of consciousness and extra@@ py@@ ram@@ id@@ al symptoms .
Management of over@@ dose should concentrate on sup@@ por@@ tive therapy , maintaining an adequate air@@ way , oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ventil@@ ation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medic@@ inal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electro@@ cardi@@ ographic monitoring to detect possible ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
Following any confirmed or susp@@ ected over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient re@@ covers .
Activ@@ ated char@@ coal ( 50 g ) , administ@@ ered one hour after ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , decreased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole C@@ max by about 41 % and AU@@ C by about 51 % , suggest@@ ing that char@@ coal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose .
Although there is no information on the effect of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in tre@@ ating an over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is un@@ likely to be useful in over@@ dose management since ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is highly bound to plas@@ ma proteins .

30 It has been proposed that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ’ s eff@@ ic@@ acy in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order is medi@@ ated through a combination of partial agon@@ ism at d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 2 and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and ant@@ agon@@ ism of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole exhib@@ ited ant@@ agon@@ ist properties in animal models of d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ ergi@@ c hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ ergi@@ c hypo@@ activity .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole exhib@@ ited high binding aff@@ inity in vit@@ ro for d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and moderate aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 4 , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , alp@@ ha@@ -1 ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ am@@ ine H@@ 1 rec@@ ept@@ ors .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole also exhib@@ ited moderate binding aff@@ inity for the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in re@@ up@@ take site and no appreci@@ able aff@@ inity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic rec@@ ept@@ ors .
Inter@@ action with rec@@ ept@@ ors other than d@@ op@@ am@@ ine and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in sub@@ types may explain some of the other clinical effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole d@@ oses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administ@@ ered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dos@@ e-@@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C-@@ rac@@ lo@@ pride , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ and , to the cau@@ date and put@@ amen detected by pos@@ it@@ ron emission tom@@ ography .
Further information on clinical trials :
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia :
In three short-@@ term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials involving 1,@@ 2@@ 28 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was associated with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol@@ -@@ controlled trial , the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medic@@ inal product at 5@@ 2-@@ weeks was similar in both groups ( ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 43 % ) than for hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 30 % ) .
Ac@@ tual scores in rating sc@@ ales used as secondary end@@ points , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ y-@@ As@@ berg Depression Rating Sc@@ ale showed a significant improvement over hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial in stabili@@ sed patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate , 34 % in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in plac@@ eb@@ o .
Weight gain : in clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine-@@ controlled , double-@@ blind , multi-@@ national study of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia which included 3@@ 14 patients and where the primary end-@@ point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over bas@@ eline ( i@@ . e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean bas@@ eline weight of ~ 8@@ 0.5 kg ) on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 , or 13 % of evalu@@ able patients ) , compared to ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine ( N = 45 , or 33 % of evalu@@ able patients ) .
Man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
In two 3-@@ week , flexi@@ b@@ le-@@ dose , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trials involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psycho@@ tic features and with or without a rap@@ id-@@ cycling course .
In one 3-@@ week , fix@@ ed-@@ dose , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trial involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole failed to demonstrate superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o .
In two 12-@@ week , plac@@ ebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trials in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , with or without psycho@@ tic features , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to li@@ th@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l at week 12 .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in sympt@@ omati@@ c re@@ mission from man@@ ia as li@@ th@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l at week 12 .
In a 6-@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , with or without psycho@@ tic features , who were partially non-@@ respon@@ sive to li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ o@@ therapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic ser@@ um levels , the addition of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resulted in superior eff@@ ic@@ acy in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms than li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ o@@ therapy .
31 In a 26@@ -@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week extension , in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated su@@ peri@@ ority over plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing bi@@ pol@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence , primarily in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into man@@ ia but failed to demonstrate su@@ peri@@ ority over plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into depression .
5.2 Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ ption :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is well absor@@ bed , with peak plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations occurr@@ ing within 3-5 hours after d@@ osing .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole under@@ goes minimal pre-@@ system@@ ic metabolism .
The absolute oral bio@@ availability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Distribution :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.@@ 9 l / kg , indic@@ ating extensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution .
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole are greater than 99 % bound to ser@@ um proteins , binding primarily to alb@@ um@@ in .
Met@@ aboli@@ sm :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is exten@@ sively metaboli@@ sed by the liver primarily by three bi@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation path@@ ways : de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation , hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation , and N-@@ deal@@ k@@ yl@@ ation .
Based on in vit@@ ro studies , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enz@@ y@@ mes are responsible for de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation and hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , and N-@@ deal@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cat@@ aly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is the pre@@ dominant medic@@ inal product mo@@ i@@ ety in system@@ ic circulation .
At ste@@ ady state , de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , represents about 40 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C in plas@@ ma .
Eli@@ min@@ ation :
The mean elim@@ ination half-@@ lives for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metaboli@@ sers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours in poor metaboli@@ sers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
The total body clear@@ ance of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is 0.@@ 7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily h@@ ep@@ atic .
Following a single oral dose of &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ lab@@ elled ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , approximately 27 % of the administ@@ ered radio@@ activity was recovered in the ur@@ ine and approximately 60 % in the fa@@ eces .
Less than 1 % of un@@ changed ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was ex@@ cre@@ ted in the ur@@ ine and approximately 18 % was recovered un@@ changed in the fa@@ eces .
Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics in special patient groups
El@@ derly :
There are no differences in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any det@@ ec@@ table effect of age in a population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients .
Gender :
There are no differences in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any det@@ ec@@ table effect of gender in a population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients .
Smoking and Race :
Population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clin@@ ically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smoking upon the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Ren@@ al Dis@@ ease :
The ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were found to be similar in patients with severe ren@@ al disease compared to young healthy subjects .
32 H@@ ep@@ atic Dis@@ ease :
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ ying degrees of liver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis ( Chil@@ d-@@ Pu@@ gh Cl@@ asses A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis , which is in@@ sufficient to draw conclusions on their metaboli@@ c capacity .
5.@@ 3 Prec@@ lin@@ ical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special haz@@ ard for humans based on conventional studies of safety ph@@ armac@@ ology , repe@@ at-@@ dose tox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , and tox@@ ic@@ ity to reproduction .
To@@ x@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only at d@@ oses or expos@@ ures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indic@@ ating that these effects were limited or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use .
These included : dos@@ e-@@ dependent ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical tox@@ ic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ in pig@@ ment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 3 to 10 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical car@@ cin@@ omas and combined ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical aden@@ omas / car@@ cin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest n@@ ont@@ um@@ orig@@ en@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a consequence of precipitation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy metaboli@@ tes of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in the b@@ ile of mon@@ keys after repeated oral d@@ osing at 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg / m2 ) .
However , the concentr@@ ations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in human b@@ ile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the b@@ ile concentr@@ ations found in the mon@@ keys in the 3@@ 9-@@ week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vit@@ ro sol@@ u@@ bility .
Based on results of a full range of standard gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was considered non-@@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not imp@@ air fer@@ tility in re@@ productive tox@@ ic@@ ity studies .
Develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity , including dos@@ e-@@ dependent del@@ ayed fo@@ etal ossi@@ fication and possible ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects , were observed in rats at d@@ oses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic expos@@ ures ( based on AU@@ C ) and in rab@@ bits at d@@ oses resulting in expos@@ ures 3 and 11 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Mat@@ ern@@ al tox@@ ic@@ ity occurred at d@@ oses similar to those el@@ ic@@ iting develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity .

4.1 Therap@@ eu@@ tic indic@@ ations
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who experienced pre@@ domin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes responded to ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Pos@@ ology and method of administration
Or@@ al use .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
Enh@@ anced eff@@ ic@@ acy at d@@ oses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Man@@ ic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals as mon@@ o@@ therapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence prevention of man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
For preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have been receiving ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Ad@@ just@@ ments of daily dos@@ age , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents : there is no experience in children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years of age .
Pati@@ ents with h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment .
In patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment , the data available are in@@ sufficient to establish recommendations .
However , the
35 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Pati@@ ents with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required in patients with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment .
El@@ derly : the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ rant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metaboli@@ c path@@ way of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itors with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itor is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be increased .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ er is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Con@@ tra@@ indic@@ ations
Hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or to any of the ex@@ cip@@ i@@ ents .
4.4 Special war@@ nings and prec@@ au@@ tions for use
During anti@@ psycho@@ tic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Pati@@ ents should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurr@@ ence of su@@ ic@@ id@@ al behaviour is inher@@ ent in psycho@@ tic ill@@ nesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initi@@ ation or switch of anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , including treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Close supervision of high-@@ risk patients should accompany anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy .
Results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of su@@ ic@@ id@@ ality with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics among patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order .
Cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disorders :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease ( history of my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , or conduc@@ tion ab@@ norm@@ alities ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions which would pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to h@@ yp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , and treatment with anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive medic@@ ations ) or hyper@@ tension , including acceler@@ ated or mal@@ ign@@ ant .
Con@@ duction ab@@ norm@@ alities :
In clinical trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the inci@@ dence of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation was comparable to plac@@ eb@@ o .
As with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with a family history of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation .
Tar@@ dive Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were un@@ common reports of treatment emerg@@ ent dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
If signs and symptoms of tar@@ dive dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appear in a patient on AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , dose reduction or dis@@ continu@@ ation should be considered .
These symptoms can tempor@@ ally deteri@@ or@@ ate or can even arise after dis@@ continu@@ ation of treatment .
Neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic Mal@@ ign@@ ant Syn@@ drome ( N@@ MS ) :
N@@ MS is a potentially fat@@ al sy@@ mp@@ tom complex associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of N@@ MS were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
36 mental status and evidence of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pul@@ se or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ ap@@ hor@@ esis and cardi@@ ac d@@ ys@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ia ) .
Additional signs may include elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase , my@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ur@@ ia ( r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis ) , and ac@@ ute ren@@ al failure .
However , elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase and r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , not necessarily in association with N@@ MS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of N@@ MS , or presents with un@@ explained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifest@@ ations of N@@ MS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be dis@@ continued .
Sei@@ z@@ ure : in clinical trials , un@@ common cases of sei@@ z@@ ure were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Therefore , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients who have a history of sei@@ z@@ ure dis@@ order or have conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
El@@ derly patients with de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis :
Incre@@ ased mort@@ ality : in three plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials ( n = 9@@ 38 ; mean age :
8@@ 2.4 years ; range :
5@@ 6-@@ 99 years ) of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alz@@ heimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were at increased risk of death compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
The rate of death in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the plac@@ eb@@ o group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or inf@@ ec@@ tious ( e. g. pneum@@ onia ) in nature .
Cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events : in the same trials , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events ( e. g. stroke , transi@@ ent isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic attack ) , including fat@@ alities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
84 years ; range :
7@@ 8-@@ 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients reported cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events compared with 0.@@ 6 % of plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statisti@@ cally significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fix@@ ed-@@ dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events in patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is not approved for the treatment of de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis .
Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and Diabetes M@@ elli@@ tus : hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , has been reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
Risk factors that may pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to severe complic@@ ations include o@@ bes@@ ity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there were no significant differences in the inci@@ dence rates of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events ( including diabetes ) or in ab@@ normal gly@@ ca@@ emia laboratory values compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
Prec@@ ise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events in patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and with other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents are not available to allow direct comparis@@ ons .
Pati@@ ents treated with any anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( such as poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weak@@ ness ) and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly for wor@@ sen@@ ing of glu@@ c@@ ose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic and bi@@ pol@@ ar man@@ ia patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics known to cause weight gain , poor@@ ly managed life-@@ style , and might lead to severe complic@@ ations .
Weight gain has been reported post-@@ marketing among patients prescri@@ bed AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , th@@ y@@ ro@@ id dis@@ order or p@@ itu@@ itary aden@@ oma .
In clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia : o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al d@@ ys@@ mo@@ tility and asp@@ ir@@ ation have been associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug use , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and other anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients at risk for asp@@ ir@@ ation pneum@@ onia .
L@@ act@@ ose : patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary problems of gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , the l@@ app l@@ act@@ ase defic@@ i@@ ency or glu@@ cos@@ e-@@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absor@@ ption should not take this medic@@ inal product .
Hyper@@ sensitivity : as with other medic@@ ations hyper@@ sensitivity reactions , characterised by aller@@ gic symptoms , may occur with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
37 4.5 Inter@@ action with other medic@@ inal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-@@ ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c recep@@ tor ant@@ agon@@ ism , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive agents .
Given the primary CN@@ S effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , cau@@ tion should be used when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CN@@ S medic@@ inal products with over@@ l@@ apping undes@@ irable effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
If ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with medicines known to cause Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation or elec@@ trol@@ yte im@@ balance , cau@@ tion should be used .
Potential for other medic@@ inal products to affect AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y :
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , the H@@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ d@@ ine , reduces ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole rate of absor@@ ption but this effect is deemed not clin@@ ically relevant .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is metaboli@@ sed by multiple path@@ ways involving the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 enz@@ y@@ mes but not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A enz@@ y@@ mes .
Thus , no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C by 107 % , while C@@ max was un@@ changed .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y with qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine occurs .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C and C@@ max by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 poor metaboli@@ sers , con@@ com@@ it@@ ant use of pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may result in higher plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to that in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metaboli@@ z@@ ers .
When considering con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , potential benefits should out@@ wei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ o@@ z@@ ole with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV pro@@ tease in@@ hib@@ itors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itor , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the level prior to the initi@@ ation of the con@@ com@@ it@@ ant therapy .
When weak in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( e. g . , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are used con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , mod@@ est increases in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations might be expected .
Following con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , a pot@@ ent in@@ duc@@ er of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the geomet@@ ric means of C@@ max and AU@@ C for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 30 mg ) was administ@@ ered alone .
Simil@@ arly , for de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole the geomet@@ ric means of C@@ max and AU@@ C after carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine co-@@ administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be dou@@ bled when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs with carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine .
John &apos;s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be reduced to the recommended dose .
38 When either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium were administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there was no clin@@ ically significant change in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations .
Potential for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to affect other medic@@ inal products :
In clinical studies , 10-@@ 30 mg / day d@@ oses of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had no significant effect on the metabolism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3-@@ metho@@ xy@@ mor@@ ph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ) , and 3@@ A4 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
Additionally , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not show potential for alter@@ ing C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A@@ 2-@@ medi@@ ated metabolism in vit@@ ro .
Thus , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is un@@ likely to cause clin@@ ically important medic@@ inal product inter@@ actions medi@@ ated by these enz@@ y@@ mes .
When ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium , there was no clin@@ ically important change in val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium concentr@@ ations .
4.@@ 6 Pre@@ gn@@ ancy and lac@@ tation
There are no adequate and well-@@ controlled trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclu@@ de potential develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity ( see section 5.@@ 3 ) .
Pati@@ ents should be advised to noti@@ fy their physi@@ cian if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Due to in@@ sufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal re@@ productive studies , this medic@@ inal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk to the fo@@ etus .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was ex@@ cre@@ ted in the milk of treated rats during lac@@ tation .
Pati@@ ents should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
4.@@ 7 Eff@@ ects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be cau@@ tioned about operating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reason@@ ably certain that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole does not affect them ad@@ ver@@ sely .

39 Extra@@ py@@ ram@@ id@@ al symptoms ( EP@@ S ) :
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia - in a long term 5@@ 2-@@ week controlled trial , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients had an over@@ all-@@ lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EP@@ S including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared with those treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
In a long term 26@@ -@@ week plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 19 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 13@@ .1 % for plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients .
In another long-term 26@@ -@@ week controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 14.@@ 8 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 15@@ .1 % for ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine-@@ treated patients .

In another 12-@@ week trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 26.@@ 6 % for patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those treated with li@@ th@@ ium .
In the long term 26@@ -@@ week maintenance phase of a plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 18.@@ 2 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients .
In plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials , the inci@@ dence of ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia in bi@@ pol@@ ar patients was 12.@@ 1 % with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 3.2 % with plac@@ eb@@ o .
In sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia patients the inci@@ dence of ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia was 6.2 % with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 3.0 % with plac@@ eb@@ o .
Compar@@ is@@ ons between ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ eb@@ o in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally important differences .
Elev@@ ations of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ ine Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ omati@@ c , were observed in 3.5 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received plac@@ eb@@ o .

4.@@ 9 Over@@ dose
In clinical trials and post-@@ marketing experience , acci@@ dental or inten@@ tional ac@@ ute over@@ dos@@ age of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated d@@ oses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fat@@ alities .
The potentially medi@@ cally important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , increased blood pressure , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea .
In addition , reports of acci@@ dental over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fat@@ alities .
The potentially medi@@ cally serious signs and symptoms reported included som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , transi@@ ent loss of consciousness and extra@@ py@@ ram@@ id@@ al symptoms .
Management of over@@ dose should concentrate on sup@@ por@@ tive therapy , maintaining an adequate air@@ way , oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ventil@@ ation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medic@@ inal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electro@@ cardi@@ ographic monitoring to detect possible ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
Following any confirmed or susp@@ ected over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient re@@ covers .
Activ@@ ated char@@ coal ( 50 g ) , administ@@ ered one hour after ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , decreased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole C@@ max by about 41 % and AU@@ C by about 51 % , suggest@@ ing that char@@ coal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose .
Although there is no information on the effect of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in tre@@ ating an over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is un@@ likely to be useful in over@@ dose management since ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is highly bound to plas@@ ma proteins .

41 It has been proposed that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ’ s eff@@ ic@@ acy in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order is medi@@ ated through a combination of partial agon@@ ism at d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 2 and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and ant@@ agon@@ ism of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole exhib@@ ited ant@@ agon@@ ist properties in animal models of d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ ergi@@ c hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ ergi@@ c hypo@@ activity .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole exhib@@ ited high binding aff@@ inity in vit@@ ro for d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and moderate aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 4 , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , alp@@ ha@@ -1 ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ am@@ ine H@@ 1 rec@@ ept@@ ors .

Inter@@ action with rec@@ ept@@ ors other than d@@ op@@ am@@ ine and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in sub@@ types may explain some of the other clinical effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole d@@ oses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administ@@ ered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dos@@ e-@@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C-@@ rac@@ lo@@ pride , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ and , to the cau@@ date and put@@ amen detected by pos@@ it@@ ron emission tom@@ ography .

Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia :
In three short-@@ term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials involving 1,@@ 2@@ 28 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was associated with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol@@ -@@ controlled trial , the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medic@@ inal product at 5@@ 2-@@ weeks was similar in both groups ( ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 43 % ) than for hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 30 % ) .
Ac@@ tual scores in rating sc@@ ales used as secondary end@@ points , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ y-@@ As@@ berg Depression Rating Sc@@ ale showed a significant improvement over hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial in stabili@@ sed patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate , 34 % in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in plac@@ eb@@ o .
Weight gain : in clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine-@@ controlled , double-@@ blind , multi-@@ national study of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia which included 3@@ 14 patients and where the primary end-@@ point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over bas@@ eline ( i@@ . e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean bas@@ eline weight of ~ 8@@ 0.5 kg ) on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 , or 13 % of evalu@@ able patients ) , compared to ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine ( N = 45 , or 33 % of evalu@@ able patients ) .
Man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
In two 3-@@ week , flexi@@ b@@ le-@@ dose , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trials involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psycho@@ tic features and with or without a rap@@ id-@@ cycling course .
In one 3-@@ week , fix@@ ed-@@ dose , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trial involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole failed to demonstrate superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o .
In two 12-@@ week , plac@@ ebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trials in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , with or without psycho@@ tic features , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to li@@ th@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l at week 12 .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in sympt@@ omati@@ c re@@ mission from man@@ ia as li@@ th@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l at week 12 .
In a 6-@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , with or without psycho@@ tic features , who were partially non-@@ respon@@ sive to li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ o@@ therapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic ser@@ um levels , the addition of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resulted in superior eff@@ ic@@ acy in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms than li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ o@@ therapy .
42 In a 26@@ -@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week extension , in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated su@@ peri@@ ority over plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing bi@@ pol@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence , primarily in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into man@@ ia but failed to demonstrate su@@ peri@@ ority over plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into depression .
5.2 Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ ption :

A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole under@@ goes minimal pre-@@ system@@ ic metabolism .
The absolute oral bio@@ availability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Distribution :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.@@ 9 l / kg , indic@@ ating extensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution .
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole are greater than 99 % bound to ser@@ um proteins , binding primarily to alb@@ um@@ in .
Met@@ aboli@@ sm :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is exten@@ sively metaboli@@ sed by the liver primarily by three bi@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation path@@ ways : de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation , hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation , and N-@@ deal@@ k@@ yl@@ ation .
Based on in vit@@ ro studies , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enz@@ y@@ mes are responsible for de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation and hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , and N-@@ deal@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cat@@ aly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is the pre@@ dominant medic@@ inal product mo@@ i@@ ety in system@@ ic circulation .
At ste@@ ady state , de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , represents about 40 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C in plas@@ ma .
Eli@@ min@@ ation :
The mean elim@@ ination half-@@ lives for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metaboli@@ sers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours in poor metaboli@@ sers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .

Following a single oral dose of &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ lab@@ elled ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , approximately 27 % of the administ@@ ered radio@@ activity was recovered in the ur@@ ine and approximately 60 % in the fa@@ eces .
Less than 1 % of un@@ changed ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was ex@@ cre@@ ted in the ur@@ ine and approximately 18 % was recovered un@@ changed in the fa@@ eces .
Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics in special patient groups
El@@ derly :
There are no differences in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any det@@ ec@@ table effect of age in a population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients .
Gender :
There are no differences in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any det@@ ec@@ table effect of gender in a population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients .
Smoking and Race :
Population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clin@@ ically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smoking upon the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Ren@@ al Dis@@ ease :
The ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were found to be similar in patients with severe ren@@ al disease compared to young healthy subjects .
43 H@@ ep@@ atic Dis@@ ease :
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ ying degrees of liver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis ( Chil@@ d-@@ Pu@@ gh Cl@@ asses A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis , which is in@@ sufficient to draw conclusions on their metaboli@@ c capacity .
5.@@ 3 Prec@@ lin@@ ical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special haz@@ ard for humans based on conventional studies of safety ph@@ armac@@ ology , repe@@ at-@@ dose tox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , and tox@@ ic@@ ity to reproduction .
To@@ x@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only at d@@ oses or expos@@ ures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indic@@ ating that these effects were limited or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use .
These included : dos@@ e-@@ dependent ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical tox@@ ic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ in pig@@ ment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 3 to 10 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical car@@ cin@@ omas and combined ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical aden@@ omas / car@@ cin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest n@@ ont@@ um@@ orig@@ en@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a consequence of precipitation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy metaboli@@ tes of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in the b@@ ile of mon@@ keys after repeated oral d@@ osing at 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg / m2 ) .
However , the concentr@@ ations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in human b@@ ile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the b@@ ile concentr@@ ations found in the mon@@ keys in the 3@@ 9-@@ week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vit@@ ro sol@@ u@@ bility .
Based on results of a full range of standard gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was considered non-@@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not imp@@ air fer@@ tility in re@@ productive tox@@ ic@@ ity studies .
Develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity , including dos@@ e-@@ dependent del@@ ayed fo@@ etal ossi@@ fication and possible ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects , were observed in rats at d@@ oses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic expos@@ ures ( based on AU@@ C ) and in rab@@ bits at d@@ oses resulting in expos@@ ures 3 and 11 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Mat@@ ern@@ al tox@@ ic@@ ity occurred at d@@ oses similar to those el@@ ic@@ iting develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity .

CL@@ IN@@ IC@@ AL P@@ ART@@ IC@@ UL@@ AR@@ S
4.1 Therap@@ eu@@ tic indic@@ ations
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who experienced pre@@ domin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes responded to ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Pos@@ ology and method of administration
Or@@ al use .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
Enh@@ anced eff@@ ic@@ acy at d@@ oses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Man@@ ic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals as mon@@ o@@ therapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence prevention of man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
For preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have been receiving ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Ad@@ just@@ ments of daily dos@@ age , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
The or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disp@@ er@@ se in s@@ ali@@ va .
It can be taken with or without liquid .
Rem@@ oval of the int@@ act or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablet is frag@@ ile , it should be taken immediately on opening the bli@@ ster .
Altern@@ atively , disp@@ er@@ se the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
46 The or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablets may be used as an alternative to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets for patients who have difficulty to swal@@ low AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents : there is no experience in children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years of age .
Pati@@ ents with h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment .
In patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment , the data available are in@@ sufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients d@@ osing should be managed cau@@ ti@@ ously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Pati@@ ents with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required in patients with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment .
El@@ derly : the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ rant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metaboli@@ c path@@ way of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itors with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itor is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be increased .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ er is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Con@@ tra@@ indic@@ ations
Hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or to any of the ex@@ cip@@ i@@ ents .
4.4 Special war@@ nings and prec@@ au@@ tions for use
During anti@@ psycho@@ tic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Pati@@ ents should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurr@@ ence of su@@ ic@@ id@@ al behaviour is inher@@ ent in psycho@@ tic ill@@ nesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initi@@ ation or switch of anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , including treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Close supervision of high-@@ risk patients should accompany anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy .
Results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of su@@ ic@@ id@@ ality with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics among patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order .
Cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disorders :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease ( history of my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , or conduc@@ tion ab@@ norm@@ alities ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions which would pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to h@@ yp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , and treatment with anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive medic@@ ations ) or hyper@@ tension , including acceler@@ ated or mal@@ ign@@ ant .
Con@@ duction ab@@ norm@@ alities :
In clinical trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the inci@@ dence of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation was comparable to plac@@ eb@@ o .
As with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with a family history of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation .
47 Tar@@ dive Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were un@@ common reports of treatment emerg@@ ent dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
If signs and symptoms of tar@@ dive dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appear in a patient on AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , dose reduction or dis@@ continu@@ ation should be considered .
These symptoms can tempor@@ ally deteri@@ or@@ ate or can even arise after dis@@ continu@@ ation of treatment .
Neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic Mal@@ ign@@ ant Syn@@ drome ( N@@ MS ) :
N@@ MS is a potentially fat@@ al sy@@ mp@@ tom complex associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of N@@ MS were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Clin@@ ical manifest@@ ations of N@@ MS are hyper@@ py@@ re@@ x@@ ia , muscle rigi@@ dity , alter@@ ed mental status and evidence of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pul@@ se or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ ap@@ hor@@ esis and cardi@@ ac d@@ ys@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ia ) .
Additional signs may include elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase , my@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ur@@ ia ( r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis ) , and ac@@ ute ren@@ al failure .
However , elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase and r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , not necessarily in association with N@@ MS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of N@@ MS , or presents with un@@ explained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifest@@ ations of N@@ MS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be dis@@ continued .
Sei@@ z@@ ure : in clinical trials , un@@ common cases of sei@@ z@@ ure were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Therefore , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients who have a history of sei@@ z@@ ure dis@@ order or have conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
El@@ derly patients with de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis :
Incre@@ ased mort@@ ality : in three plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials ( n = 9@@ 38 ; mean age :
8@@ 2.4 years ; range :
5@@ 6-@@ 99 years ) of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alz@@ heimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were at increased risk of death compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
The rate of death in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the plac@@ eb@@ o group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or inf@@ ec@@ tious ( e. g. pneum@@ onia ) in nature .
Cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events : in the same trials , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events ( e. g. stroke , transi@@ ent isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic attack ) , including fat@@ alities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
84 years ; range :
7@@ 8-@@ 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients reported cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events compared with 0.@@ 6 % of plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statisti@@ cally significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fix@@ ed-@@ dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events in patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is not approved for the treatment of de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis .
Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and Diabetes M@@ elli@@ tus : hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , has been reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
Risk factors that may pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to severe complic@@ ations include o@@ bes@@ ity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there were no significant differences in the inci@@ dence rates of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events ( including diabetes ) or in ab@@ normal gly@@ ca@@ emia laboratory values compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
Prec@@ ise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events in patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and with other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents are not available to allow direct comparis@@ ons .
Pati@@ ents treated with any anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( such as poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weak@@ ness ) and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly for wor@@ sen@@ ing of glu@@ c@@ ose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic and bi@@ pol@@ ar man@@ ia patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics known to cause weight gain , poor@@ ly managed life-@@ style , and might lead to severe complic@@ ations .
Weight gain has been reported post-@@ marketing among patients prescri@@ bed AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , th@@ y@@ ro@@ id dis@@ order or p@@ itu@@ itary aden@@ oma .
In clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
48 Dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia : o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al d@@ ys@@ mo@@ tility and asp@@ ir@@ ation have been associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug use , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and other anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients at risk for asp@@ ir@@ ation pneum@@ onia .
Ph@@ en@@ yl@@ k@@ et@@ on@@ ur@@ ics :
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablets contain as@@ part@@ ame , a source of phen@@ yl@@ al@@ an@@ ine which may be harmful for people with phen@@ yl@@ k@@ et@@ on@@ ur@@ ia .
Hyper@@ sensitivity : as with other medic@@ ations hyper@@ sensitivity reactions , characterised by aller@@ gic symptoms , may occur with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
4.5 Inter@@ action with other medic@@ inal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-@@ ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c recep@@ tor ant@@ agon@@ ism , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive agents .
Given the primary CN@@ S effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , cau@@ tion should be used when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CN@@ S medic@@ inal products with over@@ l@@ apping undes@@ irable effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
If ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with medicines known to cause Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation or elec@@ trol@@ yte im@@ balance , cau@@ tion should be used .
Potential for other medic@@ inal products to affect AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y :
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , the H@@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ d@@ ine , reduces ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole rate of absor@@ ption but this effect is deemed not clin@@ ically relevant .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is metaboli@@ sed by multiple path@@ ways involving the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 enz@@ y@@ mes but not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A enz@@ y@@ mes .
Thus , no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C by 107 % , while C@@ max was un@@ changed .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y with qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine occurs .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C and C@@ max by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 poor metaboli@@ sers , con@@ com@@ it@@ ant use of pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may result in higher plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to that in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metaboli@@ z@@ ers .
When considering con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , potential benefits should out@@ wei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ o@@ z@@ ole with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV pro@@ tease in@@ hib@@ itors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itor , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the level prior to the initi@@ ation of the con@@ com@@ it@@ ant therapy .
When weak in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( e. g . , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are used con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , mod@@ est increases in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations might be expected .
Following con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , a pot@@ ent in@@ duc@@ er of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the geomet@@ ric means of C@@ max and AU@@ C for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 30 mg ) was administ@@ ered alone .
Simil@@ arly , for de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole the geomet@@ ric means
49 of C@@ max and AU@@ C after carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine co-@@ administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be dou@@ bled when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs with carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine .
John &apos;s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium were administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there was no clin@@ ically significant change in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations .
Potential for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to affect other medic@@ inal products :
In clinical studies , 10-@@ 30 mg / day d@@ oses of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had no significant effect on the metabolism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3-@@ metho@@ xy@@ mor@@ ph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ) , and 3@@ A4 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
Additionally , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not show potential for alter@@ ing C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A@@ 2-@@ medi@@ ated metabolism in vit@@ ro .
Thus , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is un@@ likely to cause clin@@ ically important medic@@ inal product inter@@ actions medi@@ ated by these enz@@ y@@ mes .
When ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium , there was no clin@@ ically important change in val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium concentr@@ ations .
4.@@ 6 Pre@@ gn@@ ancy and lac@@ tation
There are no adequate and well-@@ controlled trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclu@@ de potential develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity ( see section 5.@@ 3 ) .
Pati@@ ents should be advised to noti@@ fy their physi@@ cian if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Due to in@@ sufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal re@@ productive studies , this medic@@ inal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk to the fo@@ etus .

4.@@ 7 Eff@@ ects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be cau@@ tioned about operating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reason@@ ably certain that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole does not affect them ad@@ ver@@ sely .

Extra@@ py@@ ram@@ id@@ al symptoms ( EP@@ S ) :
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia - in a long term 5@@ 2-@@ week controlled trial , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients had an over@@ all-@@ lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EP@@ S including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared with those treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
In a long term 26@@ -@@ week plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 19 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 13@@ .1 % for plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients .

In another 12-@@ week trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 26.@@ 6 % for patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those treated with li@@ th@@ ium .
In the long term 26@@ -@@ week maintenance phase of a plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EP@@ S was 18.@@ 2 % for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients .
In plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials , the inci@@ dence of ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia in bi@@ pol@@ ar patients was 12.@@ 1 % with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 3.2 % with plac@@ eb@@ o .
In sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia patients the inci@@ dence of ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia was 6.2 % with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and 3.0 % with plac@@ eb@@ o .
Compar@@ is@@ ons between ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ eb@@ o in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally important differences .

4.@@ 9 Over@@ dose
In clinical trials and post-@@ marketing experience , acci@@ dental or inten@@ tional ac@@ ute over@@ dos@@ age of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated d@@ oses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fat@@ alities .
The potentially medi@@ cally important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , increased blood pressure , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea .
In addition , reports of acci@@ dental over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fat@@ alities .
The potentially medi@@ cally serious signs and symptoms reported included som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , transi@@ ent loss of consciousness and extra@@ py@@ ram@@ id@@ al symptoms .
Management of over@@ dose should concentrate on sup@@ por@@ tive therapy , maintaining an adequate air@@ way , oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ventil@@ ation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medic@@ inal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electro@@ cardi@@ ographic monitoring to detect possible ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
Following any confirmed or susp@@ ected over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient re@@ covers .
52 Activ@@ ated char@@ coal ( 50 g ) , administ@@ ered one hour after ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , decreased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole C@@ max by about 41 % and AU@@ C by about 51 % , suggest@@ ing that char@@ coal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose .
Although there is no information on the effect of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in tre@@ ating an over@@ dose with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is un@@ likely to be useful in over@@ dose management since ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is highly bound to plas@@ ma proteins .

PH@@ AR@@ MA@@ CO@@ LO@@ G@@ IC@@ AL PRO@@ PER@@ TI@@ ES
5.1 Ph@@ armac@@ o@@ dynamic properties
Ph@@ armac@@ o@@ therapeutic group : anti@@ psycho@@ tics , AT@@ C code :
N@@ 05@@ AX@@ 12
It has been proposed that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ’ s eff@@ ic@@ acy in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order is medi@@ ated through a combination of partial agon@@ ism at d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 2 and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and ant@@ agon@@ ism of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole exhib@@ ited ant@@ agon@@ ist properties in animal models of d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ ergi@@ c hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of d@@ op@@ am@@ in@@ ergi@@ c hypo@@ activity .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole exhib@@ ited high binding aff@@ inity in vit@@ ro for d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a rec@@ ept@@ ors and moderate aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ am@@ ine D@@ 4 , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , alp@@ ha@@ -1 ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ am@@ ine H@@ 1 rec@@ ept@@ ors .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole also exhib@@ ited moderate binding aff@@ inity for the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in re@@ up@@ take site and no appreci@@ able aff@@ inity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic rec@@ ept@@ ors .
Inter@@ action with rec@@ ept@@ ors other than d@@ op@@ am@@ ine and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in sub@@ types may explain some of the other clinical effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole d@@ oses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administ@@ ered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dos@@ e-@@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C-@@ rac@@ lo@@ pride , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ and , to the cau@@ date and put@@ amen detected by pos@@ it@@ ron emission tom@@ ography .
Further information on clinical trials :
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia :
In three short-@@ term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials involving 1,@@ 2@@ 28 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was associated with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol@@ -@@ controlled trial , the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medic@@ inal product at 5@@ 2-@@ weeks was similar in both groups ( ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 43 % ) than for hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 30 % ) .
Ac@@ tual scores in rating sc@@ ales used as secondary end@@ points , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ y-@@ As@@ berg Depression Rating Sc@@ ale showed a significant improvement over hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial in stabili@@ sed patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate , 34 % in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in plac@@ eb@@ o .
Weight gain : in clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine-@@ controlled , double-@@ blind , multi-@@ national study of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia which included 3@@ 14 patients and where the primary end-@@ point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over bas@@ eline ( i@@ . e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean bas@@ eline weight of ~ 8@@ 0.5 kg ) on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 , or 13 % of evalu@@ able patients ) , compared to ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine ( N = 45 , or 33 % of evalu@@ able patients ) .
Man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
In two 3-@@ week , flexi@@ b@@ le-@@ dose , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trials involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o in
These trials included patients with or without psycho@@ tic features and with or without a rap@@ id-@@ cycling course .
In one 3-@@ week , fix@@ ed-@@ dose , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trial involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole failed to demonstrate superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o .
In two 12-@@ week , plac@@ ebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled mon@@ o@@ therapy trials in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , with or without psycho@@ tic features , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated superior eff@@ ic@@ acy to plac@@ eb@@ o at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to li@@ th@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l at week 12 .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in sympt@@ omati@@ c re@@ mission from man@@ ia as li@@ th@@ ium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l at week 12 .
In a 6-@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order , with or without psycho@@ tic features , who were partially non-@@ respon@@ sive to li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ o@@ therapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic ser@@ um levels , the addition of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resulted in superior eff@@ ic@@ acy in reduction of man@@ ic symptoms than li@@ th@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ o@@ therapy .
In a 26@@ -@@ week , plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trial , followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week extension , in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission on ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated su@@ peri@@ ority over plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing bi@@ pol@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence , primarily in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into man@@ ia but failed to demonstrate su@@ peri@@ ority over plac@@ eb@@ o in preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence into depression .
5.2 Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablet is bio@@ equivalent to ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absor@@ ption .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablets may be used as an alternative to ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole tablets .
Ab@@ sor@@ ption :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is well absor@@ bed , with peak plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations occurr@@ ing within 3-5 hours after d@@ osing .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole under@@ goes minimal pre-@@ system@@ ic metabolism .
The absolute oral bio@@ availability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Distribution :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.@@ 9 l / kg , indic@@ ating extensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution .
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole are greater than 99 % bound to ser@@ um proteins , binding primarily to alb@@ um@@ in .
Met@@ aboli@@ sm :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is exten@@ sively metaboli@@ sed by the liver primarily by three bi@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation path@@ ways : de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation , hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation , and N-@@ deal@@ k@@ yl@@ ation .
Based on in vit@@ ro studies , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enz@@ y@@ mes are responsible for de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation and hydro@@ x@@ yl@@ ation of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , and N-@@ deal@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cat@@ aly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is the pre@@ dominant medic@@ inal product mo@@ i@@ ety in system@@ ic circulation .
At ste@@ ady state , de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , represents about 40 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C in plas@@ ma .
Eli@@ min@@ ation :
The mean elim@@ ination half-@@ lives for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metaboli@@ sers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours in poor metaboli@@ sers of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
The total body clear@@ ance of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is 0.@@ 7 ml / min / kg , which is primarily h@@ ep@@ atic .
Following a single oral dose of &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ lab@@ elled ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , approximately 27 % of the administ@@ ered radio@@ activity was recovered in the ur@@ ine and approximately 60 % in the fa@@ eces .
Less than 1 % of un@@ changed ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was ex@@ cre@@ ted in the ur@@ ine and approximately 18 % was recovered un@@ changed in the fa@@ eces .
54 Ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics in special patient groups
El@@ derly :
There are no differences in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any det@@ ec@@ table effect of age in a population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients .
Gender :
There are no differences in the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any det@@ ec@@ table effect of gender in a population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients .
Smoking and Race :
Population ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clin@@ ically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smoking upon the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Ren@@ al Dis@@ ease :
The ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were found to be similar in patients with severe ren@@ al disease compared to young healthy subjects .
H@@ ep@@ atic Dis@@ ease :
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ ying degrees of liver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis ( Chil@@ d-@@ Pu@@ gh Cl@@ asses A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment on the ph@@ armac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis , which is in@@ sufficient to draw conclusions on their metaboli@@ c capacity .
5.@@ 3 Prec@@ lin@@ ical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special haz@@ ard for humans based on conventional studies of safety ph@@ armac@@ ology , repe@@ at-@@ dose tox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , and tox@@ ic@@ ity to reproduction .
To@@ x@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only at d@@ oses or expos@@ ures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indic@@ ating that these effects were limited or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use .
These included : dos@@ e-@@ dependent ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical tox@@ ic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ in pig@@ ment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 3 to 10 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical car@@ cin@@ omas and combined ad@@ ren@@ oc@@ or@@ tical aden@@ omas / car@@ cin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest n@@ ont@@ um@@ orig@@ en@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a consequence of precipitation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy metaboli@@ tes of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in the b@@ ile of mon@@ keys after repeated oral d@@ osing at 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg / m2 ) .
However , the concentr@@ ations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in human b@@ ile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the b@@ ile concentr@@ ations found in the mon@@ keys in the 3@@ 9-@@ week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vit@@ ro sol@@ u@@ bility .
Based on results of a full range of standard gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was considered non-@@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not imp@@ air fer@@ tility in re@@ productive tox@@ ic@@ ity studies .
Develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity , including dos@@ e-@@ dependent del@@ ayed fo@@ etal ossi@@ fication and possible ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects , were observed in rats at d@@ oses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic expos@@ ures ( based on AU@@ C ) and in rab@@ bits at d@@ oses resulting in expos@@ ures 3 and 11 times the mean ste@@ ad@@ y-@@ state AU@@ C at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Mat@@ ern@@ al tox@@ ic@@ ity occurred at d@@ oses similar to those el@@ ic@@ iting develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day .
Enh@@ anced eff@@ ic@@ acy at d@@ oses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Man@@ ic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg administ@@ ered on a on@@ ce-@@ a-@@ day schedule without regard to meals as mon@@ o@@ therapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence prevention of man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order :
For preventing rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have been receiving ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Ad@@ just@@ ments of daily dos@@ age , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
The or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disp@@ er@@ se in s@@ ali@@ va .
It can be taken with or without liquid .
Rem@@ oval of the int@@ act or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablet is frag@@ ile , it should be taken immediately on opening the bli@@ ster .
Altern@@ atively , disp@@ er@@ se the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
58 The or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablets may be used as an alternative to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets for patients who have difficulty to swal@@ low AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents : there is no experience in children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents under 18 years of age .
Pati@@ ents with h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment .
In patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment , the data available are in@@ sufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients d@@ osing should be managed cau@@ ti@@ ously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic imp@@ air@@ ment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Pati@@ ents with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment : no dos@@ age adjustment is required in patients with ren@@ al imp@@ air@@ ment .
El@@ derly : the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia and Bi@@ pol@@ ar I Dis@@ order in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ rant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dos@@ age adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metaboli@@ c path@@ way of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itors with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in@@ hib@@ itor is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole occurs , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should be increased .
When the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ er is with@@ drawn from the combination therapy , the ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Con@@ tra@@ indic@@ ations
Hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or to any of the ex@@ cip@@ i@@ ents .
4.4 Special war@@ nings and prec@@ au@@ tions for use
During anti@@ psycho@@ tic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Pati@@ ents should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurr@@ ence of su@@ ic@@ id@@ al behaviour is inher@@ ent in psycho@@ tic ill@@ nesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initi@@ ation or switch of anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , including treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Close supervision of high-@@ risk patients should accompany anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy .
Results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of su@@ ic@@ id@@ ality with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics among patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar dis@@ order .
Cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disorders :
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with known cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular disease ( history of my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , or conduc@@ tion ab@@ norm@@ alities ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions which would pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to h@@ yp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , and treatment with anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive medic@@ ations ) or hyper@@ tension , including acceler@@ ated or mal@@ ign@@ ant .
Con@@ duction ab@@ norm@@ alities :
In clinical trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the inci@@ dence of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation was comparable to plac@@ eb@@ o .
As with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with a family history of Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation .
59 Tar@@ dive Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were un@@ common reports of treatment emerg@@ ent dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
If signs and symptoms of tar@@ dive dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appear in a patient on AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , dose reduction or dis@@ continu@@ ation should be considered .
These symptoms can tempor@@ ally deteri@@ or@@ ate or can even arise after dis@@ continu@@ ation of treatment .
Neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic Mal@@ ign@@ ant Syn@@ drome ( N@@ MS ) :
N@@ MS is a potentially fat@@ al sy@@ mp@@ tom complex associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of N@@ MS were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Clin@@ ical manifest@@ ations of N@@ MS are hyper@@ py@@ re@@ x@@ ia , muscle rigi@@ dity , alter@@ ed mental status and evidence of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pul@@ se or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ ap@@ hor@@ esis and cardi@@ ac d@@ ys@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ia ) .
Additional signs may include elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase , my@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ur@@ ia ( r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis ) , and ac@@ ute ren@@ al failure .
However , elev@@ ated cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase and r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , not necessarily in association with N@@ MS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of N@@ MS , or presents with un@@ explained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifest@@ ations of N@@ MS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic medic@@ inal products , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be dis@@ continued .
Sei@@ z@@ ure : in clinical trials , un@@ common cases of sei@@ z@@ ure were reported during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Therefore , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole should be used with cau@@ tion in patients who have a history of sei@@ z@@ ure dis@@ order or have conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
El@@ derly patients with de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis :
Incre@@ ased mort@@ ality : in three plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ controlled trials ( n = 9@@ 38 ; mean age :
8@@ 2.4 years ; range :
5@@ 6-@@ 99 years ) of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alz@@ heimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were at increased risk of death compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
The rate of death in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the plac@@ eb@@ o group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or inf@@ ec@@ tious ( e. g. pneum@@ onia ) in nature .
Cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events : in the same trials , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events ( e. g. stroke , transi@@ ent isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic attack ) , including fat@@ alities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
84 years ; range :
7@@ 8-@@ 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ol@@ e-@@ treated patients reported cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events compared with 0.@@ 6 % of plac@@ eb@@ o-@@ treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statisti@@ cally significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fix@@ ed-@@ dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular ad@@ verse events in patients treated with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is not approved for the treatment of de@@ men@@ ti@@ a-@@ related psycho@@ sis .
Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and Diabetes M@@ elli@@ tus : hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , has been reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
Risk factors that may pre@@ disp@@ ose patients to severe complic@@ ations include o@@ bes@@ ity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there were no significant differences in the inci@@ dence rates of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events ( including diabetes ) or in ab@@ normal gly@@ ca@@ emia laboratory values compared to plac@@ eb@@ o .
Prec@@ ise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ i@@ a-@@ related ad@@ verse events in patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and with other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents are not available to allow direct comparis@@ ons .
Pati@@ ents treated with any anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( such as poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weak@@ ness ) and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly for wor@@ sen@@ ing of glu@@ c@@ ose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic and bi@@ pol@@ ar man@@ ia patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics known to cause weight gain , poor@@ ly managed life-@@ style , and might lead to severe complic@@ ations .
Weight gain has been reported post-@@ marketing among patients prescri@@ bed AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , th@@ y@@ ro@@ id dis@@ order or p@@ itu@@ itary aden@@ oma .
In clinical trials ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has not been shown to in@@ duce clin@@ ically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
60 Dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia : o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al d@@ ys@@ mo@@ tility and asp@@ ir@@ ation have been associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug use , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and other anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients at risk for asp@@ ir@@ ation pneum@@ onia .
Ph@@ en@@ yl@@ k@@ et@@ on@@ ur@@ ics :
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y or@@ o@@ disp@@ er@@ sible tablets contain as@@ part@@ ame , a source of phen@@ yl@@ al@@ an@@ ine which may be harmful for people with phen@@ yl@@ k@@ et@@ on@@ ur@@ ia .
Hyper@@ sensitivity : as with other medic@@ ations hyper@@ sensitivity reactions , characterised by aller@@ gic symptoms , may occur with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
4.5 Inter@@ action with other medic@@ inal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-@@ ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c recep@@ tor ant@@ agon@@ ism , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain anti@@ hyper@@ ten@@ sive agents .
Given the primary CN@@ S effects of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , cau@@ tion should be used when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CN@@ S medic@@ inal products with over@@ l@@ apping undes@@ irable effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
If ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with medicines known to cause Q@@ T pro@@ long@@ ation or elec@@ trol@@ yte im@@ balance , cau@@ tion should be used .
Potential for other medic@@ inal products to affect AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y :
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , the H@@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ d@@ ine , reduces ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole rate of absor@@ ption but this effect is deemed not clin@@ ically relevant .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is metaboli@@ sed by multiple path@@ ways involving the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 enz@@ y@@ mes but not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A enz@@ y@@ mes .
Thus , no dos@@ age adjustment is required for smo@@ kers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C by 107 % , while C@@ max was un@@ changed .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , the active metaboli@@ te , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y with qu@@ in@@ id@@ ine occurs .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itor of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ) increased ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C and C@@ max by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AU@@ C and C@@ max of de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 poor metaboli@@ sers , con@@ com@@ it@@ ant use of pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may result in higher plas@@ ma concentr@@ ations of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole compared to that in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metaboli@@ z@@ ers .
When considering con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , potential benefits should out@@ wei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient .
When con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ o@@ z@@ ole with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be reduced to approximately one-@@ half of its prescri@@ bed dose .
Other pot@@ ent in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV pro@@ tease in@@ hib@@ itors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reduc@@ tions should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itor , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the level prior to the initi@@ ation of the con@@ com@@ it@@ ant therapy .
When weak in@@ hib@@ itors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( e. g . , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are used con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , mod@@ est increases in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations might be expected .
Following con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , a pot@@ ent in@@ duc@@ er of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the geomet@@ ric means of C@@ max and AU@@ C for ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ( 30 mg ) was administ@@ ered alone .
Simil@@ arly , for de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole the geomet@@ ric means
61 of C@@ max and AU@@ C after carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine co-@@ administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole alone .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y dose should be dou@@ bled when con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y occurs with carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine .
John &apos;s Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of pot@@ ent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ ers , the dos@@ age of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium were administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole , there was no clin@@ ically significant change in ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole concentr@@ ations .
Potential for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to affect other medic@@ inal products :
In clinical studies , 10-@@ 30 mg / day d@@ oses of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole had no significant effect on the metabolism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3-@@ metho@@ xy@@ mor@@ ph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ ra@@ z@@ ole ) , and 3@@ A4 ( de@@ x@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
Additionally , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydro@@ -@@ ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole did not show potential for alter@@ ing C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A@@ 2-@@ medi@@ ated metabolism in vit@@ ro .
Thus , ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole is un@@ likely to cause clin@@ ically important medic@@ inal product inter@@ actions medi@@ ated by these enz@@ y@@ mes .
When ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was administ@@ ered con@@ com@@ it@@ antly with either val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium , there was no clin@@ ically important change in val@@ pro@@ ate or li@@ th@@ ium concentr@@ ations .
4.@@ 6 Pre@@ gn@@ ancy and lac@@ tation
There are no adequate and well-@@ controlled trials of ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclu@@ de potential develop@@ mental tox@@ ic@@ ity ( see section 5.@@ 3 ) .
Pati@@ ents should be advised to noti@@ fy their physi@@ cian if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
Due to in@@ sufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal re@@ productive studies , this medic@@ inal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk to the fo@@ etus .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole was ex@@ cre@@ ted in the milk of treated rats during lac@@ tation .
Pati@@ ents should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole .
4.@@ 7 Eff@@ ects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be cau@@ tioned about operating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reason@@ ably certain that ari@@ pip@@ ra@@ z@@ ole does not affect them ad@@ ver@@ sely .
4.@@ 8 Un@@ des@@ irable effects
The following undes@@ irable effects occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ eb@@ o , or were identified as possibly medi@@ cally relevant ad@@ verse reactions ( * ) :
