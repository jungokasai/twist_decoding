What is Abilify ?
Abilify is a medicine containing the active ingredient aripiprazole .
It is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg enamel tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
What is Abilify used for ?
Confused thinking and speech , hallucinations ( hearing or seeing things that do not exist ) , mistrust and delusions ; • Bipolar I disorder , a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternating with periods of normal mood .
Depressive episodes can also occur .
Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
The injection solution is used to quickly control increased restlessness or behavioral problems when oral intake of the drug is not possible .
The medicine is only available on doctor &apos;s prescription .
How is Abilify used ?
In schizophrenia , the recommended starting dose is 10 or 15 mg per day .
The maintenance dose is 15 mg once a day , but higher doses may be helpful in some patients .
In bipolar disorder , the recommended starting dose is 15 mg once a day , either alone or in combination with other medicines .
A higher dose may also be helpful in some patients .
In order to prevent manic episodes , the same dose should be administered further .
For both diseases , the solution to take or the enamel tablets can be applied to patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets .
The enamel tablets are placed on the tongue , where they quickly decompose due to saliva , or can be taken at 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

Abilify can be taken with food or on an empty stomach .
However , this dose should be used with caution in patients who have severe liver problems .
The dose of Abilify should be adjusted for patients who are also taking other medicines that are broken down in the same way as Abilify .
Abilify has not been studied in children under 18 and adults over 65 .
Further information can be found in the leaflet .
How does Abilify work ?
The active ingredient in Abilify , aripiprazole , is a so @-@ called antipsychotic .
Its exact mechanism of action is unknown , but it binds to various receptors on the surface of nerve cells in the brain .
This impairs signal transmission between brain cells by neurotransmitters , chemicals that enable neurons to communicate with each other .
Aripiprazole is thought to act primarily as a partial agonist for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5 @-@ hydroxytryptamine ( also known as serotonin ) .
This means that aripiprazole acts like 5 @-@ hydroxytryptamine and dopamine , but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters , to activate the receptors .
Since dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , aripiprazole helps to normalize brain activity , thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence .
How was Abilify investigated ?
The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was investigated in three studies over up to one year .
In two of these studies , haloperidol ( another antipsychotic ) was used as a comparative drug .
The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to placebo in two studies involving 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders who suffered from increased restlessness over a two @-@ hour period .
In all studies , changes in patients &quot; symptoms were measured on a standard scale for schizophrenia .
For the treatment of bipolar disorder , eight main studies were conducted , in which Abilify was examined for intake .
Five short @-@ term studies compared the efficacy of Abilify and placebo over three weeks in a total of 1,900 patients .
These studies were continued for a further nine weeks to investigate the persistence of the effects of the drugs .
In another study , Abilify was compared over 12 weeks in 347 patients with haloperidol ; in another study , the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence was compared in 160 patients who had already stabilized their manic symptoms with Abilify .
placebo for an existing treatment with lithium or valproate ( another antipsychotic ) in 384 patients .
The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to that of lorazepam ( another antipsychotic ) and placebo over a two @-@ hour period in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder who suffered from increased restlessness .
In all studies , patients &apos; symptoms were assessed on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
The company also carried out studies to examine how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the intake solution .
2 / 3 What benefits has Abilify shown in these studies ?
When used to treat schizophrenia , Abilify was more effective than placebo in the short @-@ term studies .
In the long @-@ term studies , Abilify was more effective than placebo and as effective as haloperidol after up to one year of treatment .
In the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abilify at doses of 5.25 mg , 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than those who received placebo .
When used to treat bipolar disorder , Abilify was more effective than placebo in reducing manic symptoms in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
Abilify also had a similar effect to haloperidol and lithium over a three @-@ week period .
This effect lasted for up to twelve weeks .
Abilify was also more effective than placebo at preventing the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to existing treatment for up to 74 weeks .
Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo at reducing symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to lorazepam .
What is the risk associated with Abilify ?
The most common side effects of Abilify taken ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extrapyramidal disturbances ( uncontrolled twitching ) , acathisia ( constant urge to move ) , tremor ( tremor ) , somnolence ( drowsiness ) , sedation ( drowsiness ) , headaches , blurred vision , dyspepsia ( heartburn ) , vomiting , nausea ( nausea ) , constipation ( constipation ) , salivary hypersecretion ( increased saliva production ) , fatigue and exhaustion , restlessness , insomnia ( sleep disturbances ) and anxiety .
Akathisia is more common in patients with bipolar disorder than in patients with schizophrenia .
Somnolence ( drowsiness ) , dizziness , headache , acathisia , nausea and vomiting occur in 1 to 10 out of every 100 patients who receive Abilify injections .
The complete list of side effects reported in connection with Abilify can be found in the package leaflet .
Abilify should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to aripiprazole or any of its other ingredients .
Why was Abilify approved ?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that the benefits of Abilify outweigh the risks in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate @-@ to @-@ severe manic episodes in bipolar II disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in whom manic episodes responded to treatment with aripiprazole .
Furthermore , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution outweigh the risks in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
The committee recommended that the marketing authorisation for Abilify be granted .

CLINICAL DATA
4.1 Applications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Dosage , type and duration of use
For taking .
Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dosage range between 10 and 30 mg / day .
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In order to prevent the recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have already received aripiprazole , the therapy should be continued at the same dose .
An adjustment of the daily dose , including a dose reduction , should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
There is no experience with children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
In patients with mild to moderate liver failure , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The available data are not sufficient to establish dosage recommendations in patients with severe liver failure .
In these patients , the dosage should be adjusted carefully .
However , the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe liver failure ( see section 5.2 ) .
In patients with renal insufficiency , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients aged 65 and over has not been demonstrated .
Taking into account the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
In women , no adjustment of dosage is required compared to men ( see section 5.2 ) .
Due to the metabolism of aripiprazole , no dose adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When highly effective CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are given in conjunction with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced .
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
If highly effective CYP3A4 inductors are given together with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased .
If the CYP3A4 inductor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , it can take several days to a few weeks for the patient &apos;s clinical condition to improve .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behavior is associated with psychotic and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the onset or change of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Close monitoring should accompany antipsychotic therapy of high @-@ risk patients .
Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder had no increased risk of suicide with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics .
Cardiovascular diseases :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , congestive heart failure , transition disorders ) , cerebrovascular diseases , conditions that predispose to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including accelerated and malignant form ) .
Reconciliation disorders :
In clinical studies with aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
3 Late @-@ stage dyskinesia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with aripiprazole .
If a patient treated with ABILIFY shows signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or stop treatment .
After stopping treatment , these symptoms can worsen for a short time or even occur .
Malignant neuroleptic syndrome ( MNS ) :
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics .
Rare cases of MNS have been reported in clinical trials during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of MNS are high fever , muscle rigidity , changing states of consciousness and signs of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating and irregular heart rhythms ) .
Other symptoms may include an increase in creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure .
However , also increases in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , which were not necessarily associated with MNS , were reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate MNS , or has an unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS , all antipsychotics , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizures : Occasional seizures during treatment with aripiprazole have been reported in clinical studies .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or conditions related to seizures .
Elderly patients with dementia @-@ associated psychosis :
In three placebo controlled studies ( n = 938 , mean age :
82.4 years ; range :
56 - 99 years ) with aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Cerebrovascular adverse events :
stroke , transitory ischemic attack ) including deaths in patients ( mean age :
84 years , Area :
78 - 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole reported adverse cerebrovascular events compared to 0.6 % of patients treated with placebo in these studies .
The difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these studies , a fixed @-@ dose study , there was a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of psychosis associated with dementia .
Hyperglycemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that can predispose patients to serious complications include family history of obesity and diabetes .
There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be screened for signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia ( such as :
polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening glucose levels .
Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities , the use of antipsychotics , where weight gain is known to be a side effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications .
Weight gain was reported after market launch in patients prescribed ABILIFY .
In the observed cases , patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes , thyroid disease or pituitary adenoma in their medical history .
In clinical studies , aripiprazole has not led to clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Motility disorders of the esophagus and aspiration have been associated with the intake of antipsychotic medications , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicines should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance , lactase deficiency or glucose galactose malabsorption should not take ABILIFY .
As with other medicinal products , hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur when taking aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
Due to its α @-@ adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole can enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Because of the primary effect of aripiprazole on the central nervous system , caution should be exercised when taking aripiprazole in combination with alcohol or other centrally active medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Aripiprazole should be taken cautiously with other medicines that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte balance disturbances .
Possible influence of other medicines on ABILIFY :
The H2 antagonist famotidine , a gastric acid blocker , reduces the absorption rate of aripiprazole , although this effect is not considered clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolized in various ways involving the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 , but not the CYP1A enzymes .
Therefore , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor ( quinidine ) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107 % while the Cmax remained unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydroaripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % respectively .
The ABILIFY dose should be reduced to about half of the prescribed dose when administered with quinidine .
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , are expected to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
37 % .
43 % .
In CYP2D6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers , joint use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering the combined administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
5 , the ABILIFY dose should be reduced to about half the prescribed dose .
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
After discontinuing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level before the start of the adjuvant therapy .
diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY , a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations can be expected .
73 % lower compared to monotherapy with aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) .
71 % lower than after monotherapy with aripiprazole .
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is given in conjunction with carbamazepine .
It is expected that other highly effective inductors of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampicin , rifabutin , phenytoin , phenobarbital , primidone , efavirenz , nevirapin and St. John &apos;s wort ) have similar effects and therefore similar dosage increases should be made .
After discontinuing the highly effective CYP3A4 inductors , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium was taken at the same time as aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Possible influence of ABILIFY on other medicines :
In clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of aripiprazole per day did not significantly affect the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3 @-@ methoxymorphine ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
In addition , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole showed no potential for a change in the metabolism mediated by CYP1A2 in vitro .
Therefore , aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes .
If aripiprazole was taken at the same time as valproate or lithium , there was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
In animal studies , potential disorders of intrauterine development could not be excluded ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient data on human safety and concerns raised in animal reproduction studies , this medicine must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted into the milk of lactating rats .
Since it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk , patients should be advised not to breastfeed while taking aripiprazole .
6 4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery
No studies have been carried out on the effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be warned not to use dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect on them .
4.8 Side Effects
The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events ( * ) :
The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Depression *
Extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients treated with aripiprazole had an overall lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , acathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 13.1 % in patients receiving placebo .
In another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % in patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.1 % in patients receiving olanzapine therapy .
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % in patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 53.3 % in patients receiving haloperidole treatment .
In another 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 17.6 % for those receiving lithium treatment .
In the long @-@ term 26 @-@ week maintenance period in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for patients receiving aripiprazole and 15.7 % for patients receiving placebo .
In placebo @-@ controlled studies , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenic patients , the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
A comparison between the patient groups receiving aripiprazole and placebo , which showed potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medically significant differences .
Increases in CPK ( creatine phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with aripiprazole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
7 Other findings :
Adverse reactions that may occur in connection with antipsychotic therapy , which have also been reported in treatment with aripiprazole , include malignant neuroleptic syndrome , late dyskinesia and seizures , adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus ( see Section 4.4 ) .

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and since the market launch , unintentional or intentional acute overdoses of aripiprazole have been observed in adult patients alone with an estimated dose of up to 1260 mg and no fatal consequences .
Potentially medically relevant signs and symptoms included lethargy , high blood pressure , drowsiness , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , unintentional aripiprazole overdoses ( up to 195 mg ) have been reported without causing death in children .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms that were reported included drowsiness , temporary loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Treatment of an overdose should focus on supportive measures , respiratory clearance , oxygen supply and ventilation , as well as symptomatic treatment .
The possibility of multiple drug participation should be considered .
Therefore , immediate monitoring of cardiovascular functions should be initiated , including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to identify possible arrhythmias .
After each present or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical monitoring is advisable until the patient has recovered .
This suggests that coal may be an effective remedy in treating an overdose .
Although no information is available on the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole , hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in the treatment of an overdose as aripiprazole has a high plasma protein involvement .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties
Antipsychotics , ATC code :
N05AX12
It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole showed antagonistic properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonistic properties in dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptors and to serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha @-@ 1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
The interaction of rifabutin and VIRAMUNE has not been studied in patients with liver disease .
9 with receptors other than the dopamine and serotonin subtypes could explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
When administering aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , positron emission tomography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-racloprid , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate nucleus and to the putamen .
More information on clinical trials :
Schizophrenia :
In three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the success of the therapy in the further treatment of patients who initially responded to the treatment .
In a haloperidol @-@ controlled study , at week 52 , the proportion of responders who maintained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperizole 73 % ) .
The overall rate of patients who completed the study was significantly higher in patients receiving aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than in the haloperizole group ( 30 % ) .
Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including PANSS and the Montgomery asbestos depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol .
In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole showed a significantly higher relapse rate , which was 34 % in the aripiprazole group and 57 % below placebo .
In clinical studies , no clinically relevant weight gain occurred with aripiprazole .
In a 26 @-@ week , olanzapine @-@ controlled , multinational , double @-@ blind schizophrenia study involving 314 patients , in which the primary study objective was &quot; weight gain , &quot; significantly fewer patients gained weight by at least 7 % compared to baseline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx .
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In two placebo @-@ controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole showed superior efficacy over placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These studies included patients with or without psychotic traits and with or without rapid @-@ cycling history .
In a placebo @-@ controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage in patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
In two placebo and activity @-@ controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole showed superior efficacy over placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12 .
Aripiprazole also had a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic features , some of which did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy at therapeutic serum levels for 2 weeks , concomitant therapy with aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to lithium or valproate monotherapy .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole proved superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of bipolar relapse , predominantly in the prevention of relapse into mania .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties
Absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with maximum plasma levels being reached within 3 @-@ 5 hours after intake .
Aripiprazole is subject to a minimal pre @-@ systemic metabolism .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
A meal with high fat content has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Distribution :
Aripiprazole is distributed throughout the body with an apparent distribution volume of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole are bound to more than 99 % of plasma proteins , mainly albumin .
Metabolism :
Dehydration , hydroxylation and N- dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , the N @-@ dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the main component of the drug in the systemic circulation .
40 % of the AUC of aripiprazole in plasma .
Elimination :
The mean elimination half @-@ life is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolizers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours for &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers via CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which mainly takes place via the liver .
27 % of the given radioactivity is found in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
18 % were found unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly :
Similarly , the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no age @-@ related effects .
Gender :
In aripiprazole , there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects , nor did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients show any sex @-@ related effects .
Smoking and ethnicity :
A population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no evidence of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
11 Kidney failure :
The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects .
Liver insufficiency :
A single @-@ dose study in subjects with varying degrees of cirrhosis of the liver ( ChildPugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect with regard to impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the liver class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions about their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical Safety Data
Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology , repeated administration toxicity , reproductive toxicity , genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential , the preclinical data showed no particular risks to humans .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , thus having limited or no significance for clinical use .
Effects included dose @-@ dependent adrenal cortex toxicity ( lipofuscinous pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats at 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to 3 to 10 times mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adrenal cortex carcinomas and combined adrenal cortex adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
The highest exposure in female rats that did not induce tumors was 7 times higher than the recommended exposure in humans .
In addition , cholelithiasis was detected as a result of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole found in human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the bile of monkeys in the 39 @-@ week study and well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solubility .
Based on the results of the complete standard battery of genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was classified as non @-@ genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not affect fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
In rabbits , these effects were observed after dosages leading to exposure of 3 and 11 times the mean Steady State AUC at the recommended maximum clinical dose .
Maternal toxic effects occurred in the dose range in which toxic effects on intrauterine development had also been observed .

CLINICAL DATA
4.1 Applications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Dosage , type and duration of use
For taking .
Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dosage range between 10 and 30 mg / day .
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In order to prevent the recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have already received aripiprazole , the therapy should be continued at the same dose .
An adjustment of the daily dose , including a dose reduction , should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
There is no experience with children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
In patients with mild to moderate liver failure , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The available data are not sufficient to establish dosage recommendations in patients with severe liver failure .
In these patients , the dosage should be adjusted carefully .
However , the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe liver failure ( see section 5.2 ) .
In patients with renal insufficiency , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients aged 65 and over has not been demonstrated .
Taking into account the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
In women , no adjustment of dosage is required compared to men ( see section 5.2 ) .
Due to the metabolism of aripiprazole , no dose adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When highly effective CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are given in conjunction with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced .
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
If highly effective CYP3A4 inductors are given together with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased .
If the CYP3A4 inductor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , it can take several days to a few weeks for the patient &apos;s clinical condition to improve .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behavior is associated with psychotic and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the onset or change of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Close monitoring should accompany antipsychotic therapy of high @-@ risk patients .
Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder had no increased risk of suicide with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics .
Cardiovascular diseases :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , congestive heart failure , transition disorders ) , cerebrovascular diseases , conditions that predispose to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including accelerated and malignant form ) .
Reconciliation disorders :
In clinical studies with aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
15 late dyskinesia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with aripiprazole .
If a patient treated with ABILIFY shows signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or stop treatment .
After stopping treatment , these symptoms can worsen for a short time or even occur .
Malignant neuroleptic syndrome ( MNS ) :
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics .
Rare cases of MNS have been reported in clinical trials during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of MNS are high fever , muscle rigidity , changing states of consciousness and signs of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating and irregular heart rhythms ) .
Other symptoms may include an increase in creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure .
However , also increases in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , which were not necessarily associated with MNS , were reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate MNS , or has an unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS , all antipsychotics , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizures : Occasional seizures during treatment with aripiprazole have been reported in clinical studies .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or conditions related to seizures .
Elderly patients with dementia @-@ associated psychosis :
In three placebo controlled studies ( n = 938 , mean age :
82.4 years ; range :
56 - 99 years ) with aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Cerebrovascular adverse events :
stroke , transitory ischemic attack ) including deaths in patients ( mean age :
84 years , Area :
78 - 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole reported adverse cerebrovascular events compared to 0.6 % of patients treated with placebo in these studies .
The difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these studies , a fixed @-@ dose study , there was a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of psychosis associated with dementia .
Hyperglycemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that can predispose patients to serious complications include family history of obesity and diabetes .
There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be screened for signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia ( such as :
polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening glucose levels .
Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities , the use of antipsychotics , where weight gain is known to be a side effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications .
Weight gain was reported after market launch in patients prescribed ABILIFY .
In the observed cases , patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes , thyroid disease or pituitary adenoma in their medical history .
In clinical studies , aripiprazole has not led to clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Motility disorders of the esophagus and aspiration have been associated with the intake of antipsychotic medications , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicines should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance , lactase deficiency or glucose galactose malabsorption should not take ABILIFY .
As with other medicinal products , hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur when taking aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
Due to its α @-@ adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole can enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Because of the primary effect of aripiprazole on the central nervous system , caution should be exercised when taking aripiprazole in combination with alcohol or other centrally active medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Aripiprazole should be taken cautiously with other medicines that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte balance disturbances .
Possible influence of other medicines on ABILIFY :
The H2 antagonist famotidine , a gastric acid blocker , reduces the absorption rate of aripiprazole , although this effect is not considered clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolized in various ways involving the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 , but not the CYP1A enzymes .
Therefore , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor ( quinidine ) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107 % while the Cmax remained unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydroaripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % respectively .
The ABILIFY dose should be reduced to about half of the prescribed dose when administered with quinidine .
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , are expected to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
37 % .
43 % .
In CYP2D6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers , joint use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering the combined administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
17 , the ABILIFY dose should be reduced to about half the prescribed dose .
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
After discontinuing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level before the start of the adjuvant therapy .
Diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY , a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations can be expected .
73 % lower compared to monotherapy with aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) .
71 % lower than after monotherapy with aripiprazole .
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is given in conjunction with carbamazepine .
It is expected that other highly effective inductors of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampicin , rifabutin , phenytoin , phenobarbital , primidone , efavirenz , nevirapin and St. John &apos;s wort ) have similar effects and therefore similar dosage increases should be made .
After discontinuing the highly effective CYP3A4 inductors , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium was taken at the same time as aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Possible influence of ABILIFY on other medicines :
In clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of aripiprazole per day did not significantly affect the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3 @-@ methoxymorphine ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
In addition , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole showed no potential for a change in the metabolism mediated by CYP1A2 in vitro .
Therefore , aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes .
If aripiprazole was taken at the same time as valproate or lithium , there was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
In animal studies , potential disorders of intrauterine development could not be excluded ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient data on human safety and concerns raised in animal reproduction studies , this medicine must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted into the milk of lactating rats .
Since it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk , patients should be advised not to breastfeed while taking aripiprazole .
18 4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery
No studies have been carried out on the effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be warned not to use dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect on them .
4.8 Side Effects
The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events ( * ) :
The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .

Extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients treated with aripiprazole had an overall lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , acathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 13.1 % in patients receiving placebo .
In another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % in patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.1 % in patients receiving olanzapine therapy .
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % in patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 53.3 % in patients receiving haloperidole treatment .
In another 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 17.6 % for those receiving lithium treatment .
In the long @-@ term 26 @-@ week maintenance period in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for patients receiving aripiprazole and 15.7 % for patients receiving placebo .
In placebo @-@ controlled studies , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenic patients , the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
A comparison between the patient groups receiving aripiprazole and placebo , which showed potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medically significant differences .
Increases in CPK ( creatine phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with aripiprazole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

In clinical trials and since the market launch , unintentional or intentional acute overdoses of aripiprazole have been observed in adult patients alone with an estimated dose of up to 1260 mg and no fatal consequences .
Potentially medically relevant signs and symptoms included lethargy , high blood pressure , drowsiness , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , unintentional aripiprazole overdoses ( up to 195 mg ) have been reported without causing death in children .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms that were reported included drowsiness , temporary loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Treatment of an overdose should focus on supportive measures , respiratory clearance , oxygen supply and ventilation , as well as symptomatic treatment .
The possibility of multiple drug participation should be considered .
Therefore , immediate monitoring of cardiovascular functions should be initiated , including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to identify possible arrhythmias .
After each present or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical monitoring is advisable until the patient has recovered .
This suggests that coal may be an effective remedy in treating an overdose .
Although no information is available on the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole , hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in the treatment of an overdose as aripiprazole has a high plasma protein involvement .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties
Antipsychotics , ATC code :
N05AX12
It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole showed antagonistic properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonistic properties in dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptors and to serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha @-@ 1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
The interaction of rifabutin and VIRAMUNE has not been studied in patients with liver disease .
21 with receptors other than the dopamine and serotonin subtypes could explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
When administering aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , positron emission tomography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-racloprid , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate nucleus and to the putamen .
More information on clinical trials :
Schizophrenia :
In three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the success of the therapy in the further treatment of patients who initially responded to the treatment .
In a haloperidol @-@ controlled study , at week 52 , the proportion of responders who maintained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperizole 73 % ) .
The overall rate of patients who completed the study was significantly higher in patients receiving aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than in the haloperizole group ( 30 % ) .
Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including PANSS and the Montgomery asbestos depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol .
In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole showed a significantly higher relapse rate , which was 34 % in the aripiprazole group and 57 % below placebo .
In clinical studies , no clinically relevant weight gain occurred with aripiprazole .
In a 26 @-@ week , olanzapine @-@ controlled , multinational , double @-@ blind schizophrenia study involving 314 patients , in which the primary study objective was &quot; weight gain , &quot; significantly fewer patients gained weight by at least 7 % compared to baseline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx .
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In two placebo @-@ controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole showed superior efficacy over placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These studies included patients with or without psychotic traits and with or without rapid @-@ cycling history .
In a placebo @-@ controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage in patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
In two placebo and activity @-@ controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole showed superior efficacy over placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12 .
Aripiprazole also had a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic features , some of which did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy at therapeutic serum levels for 2 weeks , concomitant therapy with aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to lithium or valproate monotherapy .
22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole proved superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of bipolar relapse , predominantly in the prevention of relapse into mania .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties
Absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with maximum plasma levels being reached within 3 @-@ 5 hours after intake .
Aripiprazole is subject to a minimal pre @-@ systemic metabolism .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
A meal with high fat content has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Distribution :
Aripiprazole is distributed throughout the body with an apparent distribution volume of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole are bound to more than 99 % of plasma proteins , mainly albumin .
Metabolism :
Dehydration , hydroxylation and N- dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , the N @-@ dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the main component of the drug in the systemic circulation .
40 % of the AUC of aripiprazole in plasma .
Elimination :
The mean elimination half @-@ life is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolizers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours for &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers via CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which mainly takes place via the liver .
27 % of the given radioactivity is found in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
18 % were found unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly :
Similarly , the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no age @-@ related effects .
Gender :
In aripiprazole , there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects , nor did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients show any sex @-@ related effects .
Smoking and ethnicity :
A population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no evidence of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
23 Kidney failure :
The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects .
Liver insufficiency :
A single @-@ dose study in subjects with varying degrees of cirrhosis of the liver ( ChildPugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect with regard to impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the liver class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions about their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical Safety Data
Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology , repeated administration toxicity , reproductive toxicity , genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential , the preclinical data showed no particular risks to humans .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , thus having limited or no significance for clinical use .
Effects included dose @-@ dependent adrenal cortex toxicity ( lipofuscinous pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats at 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to 3 to 10 times mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adrenal cortex carcinomas and combined adrenal cortex adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
The highest exposure in female rats that did not induce tumors was 7 times higher than the recommended exposure in humans .
In addition , cholelithiasis was detected as a result of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole found in human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the bile of monkeys in the 39 @-@ week study and well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solubility .
Based on the results of the complete standard battery of genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was classified as non @-@ genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not affect fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
In rabbits , these effects were observed after dosages leading to exposure of 3 and 11 times the mean Steady State AUC at the recommended maximum clinical dose .
Maternal toxic effects occurred in the dose range in which toxic effects on intrauterine development had also been observed .

CLINICAL DATA
4.1 Applications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Dosage , type and duration of use
For taking .
Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dosage range between 10 and 30 mg / day .
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In order to prevent the recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have already received aripiprazole , the therapy should be continued at the same dose .
An adjustment of the daily dose , including a dose reduction , should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
There is no experience with children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
In patients with mild to moderate liver failure , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The available data are not sufficient to establish dosage recommendations in patients with severe liver failure .
In these patients , the dosage should be adjusted carefully .
However , the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe liver failure ( see section 5.2 ) .
In patients with renal insufficiency , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients aged 65 and over has not been demonstrated .
Taking into account the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
In women , no adjustment of dosage is required compared to men ( see section 5.2 ) .
Due to the metabolism of aripiprazole , no dose adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When highly effective CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are given in conjunction with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced .
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
If highly effective CYP3A4 inductors are given together with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased .
If the CYP3A4 inductor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , it can take several days to a few weeks for the patient &apos;s clinical condition to improve .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behavior is associated with psychotic and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the onset or change of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Close monitoring should accompany antipsychotic therapy of high @-@ risk patients .
Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder had no increased risk of suicide with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics .
Cardiovascular diseases :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , congestive heart failure , transition disorders ) , cerebrovascular diseases , conditions that predispose to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including accelerated and malignant form ) .
Reconciliation disorders :
In clinical studies with aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
27 late dyskinesia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with aripiprazole .
If a patient treated with ABILIFY shows signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or stop treatment .
After stopping treatment , these symptoms can worsen for a short time or even occur .
Malignant neuroleptic syndrome ( MNS ) :
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics .
Rare cases of MNS have been reported in clinical trials during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of MNS are high fever , muscle rigidity , changing states of consciousness and signs of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating and irregular heart rhythms ) .
Other symptoms may include an increase in creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure .
However , also increases in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , which were not necessarily associated with MNS , were reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate MNS , or has an unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS , all antipsychotics , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizures : Occasional seizures during treatment with aripiprazole have been reported in clinical studies .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or conditions related to seizures .
Elderly patients with dementia @-@ associated psychosis :
In three placebo controlled studies ( n = 938 , mean age :
82.4 years ; range :
56 - 99 years ) with aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Cerebrovascular adverse events :
stroke , transitory ischemic attack ) including deaths in patients ( mean age :
84 years , Area :
78 - 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole reported adverse cerebrovascular events compared to 0.6 % of patients treated with placebo in these studies .
The difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these studies , a fixed @-@ dose study , there was a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of psychosis associated with dementia .
Hyperglycemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that can predispose patients to serious complications include family history of obesity and diabetes .
There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be screened for signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia ( such as :
polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening glucose levels .
Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities , the use of antipsychotics , where weight gain is known to be a side effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications .
Weight gain was reported after market launch in patients prescribed ABILIFY .
In the observed cases , patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes , thyroid disease or pituitary adenoma in their medical history .
In clinical studies , aripiprazole has not led to clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Motility disorders of the esophagus and aspiration have been associated with the intake of antipsychotic medications , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicines should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance , lactase deficiency or glucose galactose malabsorption should not take ABILIFY .
As with other medicinal products , hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur when taking aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
Due to its α @-@ adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole can enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Because of the primary effect of aripiprazole on the central nervous system , caution should be exercised when taking aripiprazole in combination with alcohol or other centrally active medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Aripiprazole should be taken cautiously with other medicines that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte balance disturbances .
Possible influence of other medicines on ABILIFY :
The H2 antagonist famotidine , a gastric acid blocker , reduces the absorption rate of aripiprazole , although this effect is not considered clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolized in various ways involving the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 , but not the CYP1A enzymes .
Therefore , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor ( quinidine ) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107 % while the Cmax remained unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydroaripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % respectively .
The ABILIFY dose should be reduced to about half of the prescribed dose when administered with quinidine .
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , are expected to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
37 % .
43 % .
In CYP2D6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers , joint use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering the combined administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
29 , the ABILIFY dose should be reduced to about half the prescribed dose .
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
After discontinuing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level before the start of the adjuvant therapy .
Diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY , a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations can be expected .
73 % lower compared to monotherapy with aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) .
71 % lower than after monotherapy with aripiprazole .
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is given in conjunction with carbamazepine .
It is expected that other highly effective inductors of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampicin , rifabutin , phenytoin , phenobarbital , primidone , efavirenz , nevirapin and St. John &apos;s wort ) have similar effects and therefore similar dosage increases should be made .
After discontinuing the highly effective CYP3A4 inductors , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium was taken at the same time as aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Possible influence of ABILIFY on other medicines :
In clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of aripiprazole per day did not significantly affect the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3 @-@ methoxymorphine ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
In addition , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole showed no potential for a change in the metabolism mediated by CYP1A2 in vitro .
Therefore , aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes .
If aripiprazole was taken at the same time as valproate or lithium , there was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
In animal studies , potential disorders of intrauterine development could not be excluded ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient data on human safety and concerns raised in animal reproduction studies , this medicine must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted into the milk of lactating rats .
Since it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk , patients should be advised not to breastfeed while taking aripiprazole .
30 4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery
No studies have been carried out on the effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be warned not to use dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect on them .
4.8 Side Effects
The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events ( * ) :
The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Depression *
Extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients treated with aripiprazole had an overall lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , acathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 13.1 % in patients receiving placebo .
In another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % in patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.1 % in patients receiving olanzapine therapy .
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % in patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 53.3 % in patients receiving haloperidole treatment .
In another 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 17.6 % for those receiving lithium treatment .
In the long @-@ term 26 @-@ week maintenance period in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for patients receiving aripiprazole and 15.7 % for patients receiving placebo .
In placebo @-@ controlled studies , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenic patients , the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
A comparison between the patient groups receiving aripiprazole and placebo , which showed potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medically significant differences .
Increases in CPK ( creatine phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with aripiprazole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
31 Other findings :

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and since the market launch , unintentional or intentional acute overdoses of aripiprazole have been observed in adult patients alone with an estimated dose of up to 1260 mg and no fatal consequences .
Potentially medically relevant signs and symptoms included lethargy , high blood pressure , drowsiness , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , unintentional aripiprazole overdoses ( up to 195 mg ) have been reported without causing death in children .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms that were reported included drowsiness , temporary loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Treatment of an overdose should focus on supportive measures , respiratory clearance , oxygen supply and ventilation , as well as symptomatic treatment .
The possibility of multiple drug participation should be considered .
Therefore , immediate monitoring of cardiovascular functions should be initiated , including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to identify possible arrhythmias .
After each present or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical monitoring is advisable until the patient has recovered .
This suggests that coal may be an effective remedy in treating an overdose .
Although no information is available on the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole , hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in the treatment of an overdose as aripiprazole has a high plasma protein involvement .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties
Antipsychotics , ATC code :
N05AX12
It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole showed antagonistic properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonistic properties in dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptors and to serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha @-@ 1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
The interaction of rifabutin and VIRAMUNE has not been studied in patients with liver disease .
33 with receptors other than the dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
When administering aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , positron emission tomography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-racloprid , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate nucleus and to the putamen .

In three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the success of the therapy in the further treatment of patients who initially responded to the treatment .
In a haloperidol @-@ controlled study , at week 52 , the proportion of responders who maintained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperizole 73 % ) .
The overall rate of patients who completed the study was significantly higher in patients receiving aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than in the haloperizole group ( 30 % ) .
Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including PANSS and the Montgomery asbestos depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol .
In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole showed a significantly higher relapse rate , which was 34 % in the aripiprazole group and 57 % below placebo .
In clinical studies , no clinically relevant weight gain occurred with aripiprazole .
In a 26 @-@ week , olanzapine @-@ controlled , multinational , double @-@ blind schizophrenia study involving 314 patients , in which the primary study objective was &quot; weight gain , &quot; significantly fewer patients gained weight by at least 7 % compared to baseline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx .
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In two placebo @-@ controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole showed superior efficacy over placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These studies included patients with or without psychotic traits and with or without rapid @-@ cycling history .
In a placebo @-@ controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage in patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
In two placebo and activity @-@ controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole showed superior efficacy over placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12 .
Aripiprazole also had a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic features , some of which did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy at therapeutic serum levels for 2 weeks , concomitant therapy with aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to lithium or valproate monotherapy .
34 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of bipolar relapse , predominantly in the prevention of relapse into mania .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties
Absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with maximum plasma levels being reached within 3 @-@ 5 hours after intake .
Aripiprazole is subject to a minimal pre @-@ systemic metabolism .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
A meal with high fat content has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Distribution :
Aripiprazole is distributed throughout the body with an apparent distribution volume of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole are bound to more than 99 % of plasma proteins , mainly albumin .
Metabolism :
Dehydration , hydroxylation and N- dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , the N @-@ dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the main component of the drug in the systemic circulation .
40 % of the AUC of aripiprazole in plasma .
Elimination :
The mean elimination half @-@ life is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolizers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours for &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers via CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which mainly takes place via the liver .
27 % of the given radioactivity is found in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
18 % were found unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly :
Similarly , the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no age @-@ related effects .
Gender :
In aripiprazole , there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects , nor did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients show any sex @-@ related effects .
Smoking and ethnicity :
A population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no evidence of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
35 Kidney failure :
The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects .
Liver insufficiency :
A single @-@ dose study in subjects with varying degrees of cirrhosis of the liver ( ChildPugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect with regard to impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the liver class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions about their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical Safety Data
Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology , repeated administration toxicity , reproductive toxicity , genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential , the preclinical data showed no particular risks to humans .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , thus having limited or no significance for clinical use .
Effects included dose @-@ dependent adrenal cortex toxicity ( lipofuscinous pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats at 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to 3 to 10 times mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adrenal cortex carcinomas and combined adrenal cortex adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
The highest exposure in female rats that did not induce tumors was 7 times higher than the recommended exposure in humans .
In addition , cholelithiasis was detected as a result of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole found in human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the bile of monkeys in the 39 @-@ week study and well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solubility .
Based on the results of the complete standard battery of genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was classified as non @-@ genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not affect fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
In rabbits , these effects were observed after dosages leading to exposure of 3 and 11 times the mean Steady State AUC at the recommended maximum clinical dose .
Maternal toxic effects occurred in the dose range in which toxic effects on intrauterine development had also been observed .

CLINICAL DATA
4.1 Applications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Dosage , type and duration of use
For taking .
Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dosage range between 10 and 30 mg / day .
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In order to prevent the recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have already received aripiprazole , the therapy should be continued at the same dose .
An adjustment of the daily dose , including a dose reduction , should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
There is no experience with children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
In patients with mild to moderate liver failure , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The available data are not sufficient to establish dosage recommendations in patients with severe liver failure .
In these patients , the dosage should be adjusted carefully .
However , the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe liver failure ( see section 5.2 ) .
In patients with renal insufficiency , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients aged 65 and over has not been demonstrated .
Taking into account the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
In women , no adjustment of dosage is required compared to men ( see section 5.2 ) .
Due to the metabolism of aripiprazole , no dose adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When highly effective CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are given in conjunction with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced .
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
If highly effective CYP3A4 inductors are given together with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased .
If the CYP3A4 inductor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , it can take several days to a few weeks for the patient &apos;s clinical condition to improve .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behavior is associated with psychotic and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the onset or change of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Close monitoring should accompany antipsychotic therapy of high @-@ risk patients .
Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder had no increased risk of suicide with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics .
Cardiovascular diseases :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , congestive heart failure , transition disorders ) , cerebrovascular diseases , conditions that predispose to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including accelerated and malignant form ) .
Reconciliation disorders :
In clinical studies with aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
39 late dyskinesia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with aripiprazole .
If a patient treated with ABILIFY shows signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or stop treatment .
After stopping treatment , these symptoms can worsen for a short time or even occur .
Malignant neuroleptic syndrome ( MNS ) :
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics .
Rare cases of MNS have been reported in clinical trials during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of MNS are high fever , muscle rigidity , changing states of consciousness and signs of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating and irregular heart rhythms ) .
Other symptoms may include an increase in creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure .
However , also increases in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , which were not necessarily associated with MNS , were reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate MNS , or has an unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS , all antipsychotics , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizures : Occasional seizures during treatment with aripiprazole have been reported in clinical studies .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or conditions related to seizures .
Elderly patients with dementia @-@ associated psychosis :
In three placebo controlled studies ( n = 938 , mean age :
82.4 years ; range :
56 - 99 years ) with aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Cerebrovascular adverse events :
stroke , transitory ischemic attack ) including deaths in patients ( mean age :
84 years , Area :
78 - 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole reported adverse cerebrovascular events compared to 0.6 % of patients treated with placebo in these studies .
The difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these studies , a fixed @-@ dose study , there was a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of psychosis associated with dementia .
Hyperglycemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that can predispose patients to serious complications include family history of obesity and diabetes .
There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be screened for signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia ( such as :
polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening glucose levels .
Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities , the use of antipsychotics , where weight gain is known to be a side effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications .
Weight gain was reported after market launch in patients prescribed ABILIFY .
In the observed cases , patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes , thyroid disease or pituitary adenoma in their medical history .
In clinical studies , aripiprazole has not led to clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Motility disorders of the esophagus and aspiration have been associated with the intake of antipsychotic medications , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicines should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance , lactase deficiency or glucose galactose malabsorption should not take ABILIFY .
As with other medicinal products , hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur when taking aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
Due to its α @-@ adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole can enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Because of the primary effect of aripiprazole on the central nervous system , caution should be exercised when taking aripiprazole in combination with alcohol or other centrally active medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Aripiprazole should be taken cautiously with other medicines that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte balance disturbances .
Possible influence of other medicines on ABILIFY :
The H2 antagonist famotidine , a gastric acid blocker , reduces the absorption rate of aripiprazole , although this effect is not considered clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolized in various ways involving the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 , but not the CYP1A enzymes .
Therefore , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor ( quinidine ) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107 % while the Cmax remained unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydroaripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % respectively .
The ABILIFY dose should be reduced to about half of the prescribed dose when administered with quinidine .
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , are expected to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
37 % .
43 % .
In CYP2D6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers , joint use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering the combined administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
41 , the ABILIFY dose should be reduced to about half the prescribed dose .
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
After discontinuing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level before the start of the adjuvant therapy .
diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY , a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations can be expected .
73 % lower compared to monotherapy with aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) .
71 % lower than after monotherapy with aripiprazole .
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is given in conjunction with carbamazepine .
It is expected that other highly effective inductors of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampicin , rifabutin , phenytoin , phenobarbital , primidone , efavirenz , nevirapin and St. John &apos;s wort ) have similar effects and therefore similar dosage increases should be made .
After discontinuing the highly effective CYP3A4 inductors , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium was taken at the same time as aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Possible influence of ABILIFY on other medicines :
In clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of aripiprazole per day did not significantly affect the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3 @-@ methoxymorphine ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
In addition , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole showed no potential for a change in the metabolism mediated by CYP1A2 in vitro .
Therefore , aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes .
If aripiprazole was taken at the same time as valproate or lithium , there was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
In animal studies , potential disorders of intrauterine development could not be excluded ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient data on human safety and concerns raised in animal reproduction studies , this medicine must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted into the milk of lactating rats .
Since it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk , patients should be advised not to breastfeed while taking aripiprazole .
42 4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery
No studies have been carried out on the effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be warned not to use dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect on them .
4.8 Side Effects
The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events ( * ) :
The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Depression *
Extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients treated with aripiprazole had an overall lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , acathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 13.1 % in patients receiving placebo .
In another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % in patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.1 % in patients receiving olanzapine therapy .
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % in patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 53.3 % in patients receiving haloperidole treatment .
In another 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 17.6 % for those receiving lithium treatment .
In the long @-@ term 26 @-@ week maintenance period in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for patients receiving aripiprazole and 15.7 % for patients receiving placebo .
In placebo @-@ controlled studies , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenic patients , the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
A comparison between the patient groups receiving aripiprazole and placebo , which showed potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medically significant differences .
Increases in CPK ( creatine phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with aripiprazole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
43 Other findings :

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and since the market launch , unintentional or intentional acute overdoses of aripiprazole have been observed in adult patients alone with an estimated dose of up to 1260 mg and no fatal consequences .
Potentially medically relevant signs and symptoms included lethargy , high blood pressure , drowsiness , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , unintentional aripiprazole overdoses ( up to 195 mg ) have been reported without causing death in children .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms that were reported included drowsiness , temporary loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Treatment of an overdose should focus on supportive measures , respiratory clearance , oxygen supply and ventilation , as well as symptomatic treatment .
The possibility of multiple drug participation should be considered .
Therefore , immediate monitoring of cardiovascular functions should be initiated , including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to identify possible arrhythmias .
After each present or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical monitoring is advisable until the patient has recovered .
This suggests that coal may be an effective remedy in treating an overdose .
Although no information is available on the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole , hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in the treatment of an overdose as aripiprazole has a high plasma protein involvement .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties
Antipsychotics , ATC code :
N05AX12
It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole showed antagonistic properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonistic properties in dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptors and to serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha @-@ 1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
The interaction of rifabutin and VIRAMUNE has not been studied in patients with liver disease .
45 with receptors other than the dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
When administering aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , positron emission tomography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-racloprid , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate nucleus and to the putamen .
More information on clinical trials :
Schizophrenia :
In three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the success of the therapy in the further treatment of patients who initially responded to the treatment .
In a haloperidol @-@ controlled study , at week 52 , the proportion of responders who maintained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperizole 73 % ) .
The overall rate of patients who completed the study was significantly higher in patients receiving aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than in the haloperizole group ( 30 % ) .
Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including PANSS and the Montgomery asbestos depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol .
In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole showed a significantly higher relapse rate , which was 34 % in the aripiprazole group and 57 % below placebo .
In clinical studies , no clinically relevant weight gain occurred with aripiprazole .
In a 26 @-@ week , olanzapine @-@ controlled , multinational , double @-@ blind schizophrenia study involving 314 patients , in which the primary study objective was &quot; weight gain , &quot; significantly fewer patients gained weight by at least 7 % compared to baseline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx .
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In two placebo @-@ controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole showed superior efficacy over placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These studies included patients with or without psychotic traits and with or without rapid @-@ cycling history .
In a placebo @-@ controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage in patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
In two placebo and activity @-@ controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole showed superior efficacy over placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12 .
Aripiprazole also had a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic features , some of which did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy at therapeutic serum levels for 2 weeks , concomitant therapy with aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to lithium or valproate monotherapy .
46 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole proved superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of bipolar relapse , predominantly in the prevention of relapse into mania .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties
Absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with maximum plasma levels being reached within 3 @-@ 5 hours after intake .
Aripiprazole is subject to a minimal pre @-@ systemic metabolism .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
A meal with high fat content has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Distribution :
Aripiprazole is distributed throughout the body with an apparent distribution volume of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole are bound to more than 99 % of plasma proteins , mainly albumin .
Metabolism :
Dehydration , hydroxylation and N- dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , the N @-@ dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the main component of the drug in the systemic circulation .
40 % of the AUC of aripiprazole in plasma .
Elimination :
The mean elimination half @-@ life is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolizers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours for &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers via CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which mainly takes place via the liver .
27 % of the given radioactivity is found in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
18 % were found unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly :
Similarly , the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no age @-@ related effects .
Gender :
In aripiprazole , there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects , nor did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients show any sex @-@ related effects .
Smoking and ethnicity :
A population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no evidence of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
47 Kidney failure :
The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects .
Liver insufficiency :
A single @-@ dose study in subjects with varying degrees of cirrhosis of the liver ( ChildPugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect with regard to impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the liver class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions about their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical Safety Data
Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology , repeated administration toxicity , reproductive toxicity , genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential , the preclinical data showed no particular risks to humans .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , thus having limited or no significance for clinical use .
Effects included dose @-@ dependent adrenal cortex toxicity ( lipofuscinous pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats at 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to 3 to 10 times mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adrenal cortex carcinomas and combined adrenal cortex adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
The highest exposure in female rats that did not induce tumors was 7 times higher than the recommended exposure in humans .
In addition , cholelithiasis was detected as a result of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole found in human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the bile of monkeys in the 39 @-@ week study and well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solubility .
Based on the results of the complete standard battery of genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was classified as non @-@ genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not affect fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
In rabbits , these effects were observed after dosages leading to exposure of 3 and 11 times the mean Steady State AUC at the recommended maximum clinical dose .
Maternal toxic effects occurred in the dose range in which toxic effects on intrauterine development had also been observed .

CLINICAL DATA
4.1 Applications
Aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Dosage , type and duration of use
For taking .
Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for aripiprazole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
Aripiprazole is effective in a dose range between 10 and 30 mg / day .
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In order to prevent the recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have already received aripiprazole , the therapy should be continued at the same dose .
An adjustment of the daily dose , including a dose reduction , should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
50 The enamel tablet should be placed on the tongue , where it dissolves quickly through the saliva in the mouth .
It can be taken with or without fluid .
It is difficult to take an enamel tablet out of the mouth as a whole .
Since the melting tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately after opening the blister pack .
The tablet can also be dissolved in water and the resulting suspension can be drunk .
Patients who have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets can take the enamel tablets as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
There is no experience with children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
In patients with mild to moderate liver failure , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The available data are not sufficient to establish dosage recommendations in patients with severe liver failure .
In these patients , the dosage should be adjusted carefully .
However , the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe liver failure ( see section 5.2 ) .
In patients with renal insufficiency , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients aged 65 and over has not been demonstrated .
Taking into account the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
In women , no adjustment of dosage is required compared to men ( see section 5.2 ) .
Due to the metabolism of aripiprazole , no dose adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When highly effective CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are given in conjunction with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced .
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
If highly effective CYP3A4 inductors are given together with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased .
If the CYP3A4 inductor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , it can take several days to a few weeks for the patient &apos;s clinical condition to improve .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behavior is associated with psychotic disorders and affective disorders have been reported in some cases after the onset or change of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Close monitoring should accompany antipsychotic therapy of high @-@ risk patients .
Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder had no increased risk of suicide with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics .
51 Cardiovascular diseases :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , congestive heart failure , transition disorders ) , cerebrovascular diseases , conditions that predispose to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including accelerated and malignant form ) .
Reconciliation disorders :
In clinical studies with aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Late @-@ stage dyskinesia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If a patient treated with ABILIFY shows signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or stop treatment .
After stopping treatment , these symptoms can worsen for a short time or even occur .
Malignant neuroleptic syndrome ( MNS ) :
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics .
Rare cases of MNS have been reported in clinical trials during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of MNS are high fever , muscle rigidity , changing states of consciousness and signs of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating and irregular heart rhythms ) .
Other symptoms may include an increase in creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure .
However , also increases in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , which were not necessarily associated with MNS , were reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate MNS , or has an unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS , all antipsychotics , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizures : Occasional seizures during treatment with aripiprazole have been reported in clinical studies .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or conditions related to seizures .
Elderly patients with dementia @-@ associated psychosis :
In three placebo controlled studies ( n = 938 , mean age :
82.4 years ; range :
56 - 99 years ) with aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Cerebrovascular adverse events :
stroke , transitory ischemic attack ) including deaths in patients ( mean age :
84 years , Area :
78 - 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole reported adverse cerebrovascular events compared to 0.6 % of patients treated with placebo in these studies .
The difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these studies , a fixed @-@ dose study , there was a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of psychosis associated with dementia .
Risk factors that could cause
52 patients can be predisposed to serious complications , including obesity and diabetes in the family history .
There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be screened for signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia ( such as :
polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening glucose levels .
Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities , the use of antipsychotics where weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
Weight gain was reported after market launch in patients prescribed ABILIFY .
In the observed cases , patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes , thyroid disease or pituitary adenoma in their medical history .
In clinical studies , aripiprazole has not led to clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Motility disorders of the esophagus and aspiration have been associated with the intake of antipsychotic medications , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicines should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia ,
Patients with phenylketonuria :
ABILIFY enamel tablets contain aspartame as a source of phenylalanine , which can be harmful for patients with phenylketonuria .
As with other medicinal products , hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur when taking aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
Due to its α @-@ adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole can enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Because of the primary effect of aripiprazole on the central nervous system , caution should be exercised when taking aripiprazole in combination with alcohol or other centrally active medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Aripiprazole should be taken cautiously with other medicines that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte balance disturbances .
Possible influence of other medicines on ABILIFY :
The H2 antagonist famotidine , a gastric acid blocker , reduces the absorption rate of aripiprazole , although this effect is not considered clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolized in various ways involving the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 , but not the CYP1A enzymes .
Therefore , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor ( quinidine ) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107 % while the Cmax remained unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydroaripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % respectively .
The ABILIFY dose should be reduced to about half of the prescribed dose if
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , are expected to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
37 % .
43 % .
In CYP2D6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers , joint use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering the combined administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When ketoconazole is given in conjunction with ABILIFY , the ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose .
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
After discontinuing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level before the start of the adjuvant therapy .
diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY , a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations can be expected .
73 % lower compared to monotherapy with aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) .
Similarly , for dehydroaripiprazole , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after combined use with carbamazepine decreased by 69 % and
71 % lower than after monotherapy with aripiprazole .
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is given in conjunction with carbamazepine .
It is expected that other highly effective inductors of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampicin , rifabutin , phenytoin , phenobarbital , primidone , efavirenz , nevirapin and St. John &apos;s wort ) have similar effects and therefore similar dosage increases should be made .
After discontinuing the highly effective CYP3A4 inductors , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium was taken at the same time as aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Possible influence of ABILIFY on other medicines :
In clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of aripiprazole per day did not significantly affect the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3 @-@ methoxymorphine ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
In addition , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole showed no potential for a change in the metabolism mediated by CYP1A2 in vitro .
Therefore , aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes .
If aripiprazole was taken at the same time as valproate or lithium , there was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
In animal studies , potential disorders of intrauterine development could not be excluded ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole
Due to insufficient data on human safety and concerns raised in animal reproduction studies , this medicine must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted into the milk of lactating rats .
Since it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk , patients should be advised not to breastfeed while taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery
No studies have been carried out on the effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be warned not to use dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect on them .
4.8 Side Effects
The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or classified as possible medically relevant adverse events ( * ) :

Depression *
Extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) :
Schizophrenia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients treated with aripiprazole had an overall lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , acathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 13.1 % in patients receiving placebo .
In another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % in patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.1 % in patients receiving olanzapine therapy .
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % in patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 53.3 % in patients receiving haloperidole treatment .
In another 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients receiving aripiprazole treatment and 17.6 % for those receiving lithium treatment .
In the long @-@ term 26 @-@ week maintenance period in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for patients receiving aripiprazole and 15.7 % for patients receiving placebo .
55 In placebo @-@ controlled studies , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenic patients , the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
A comparison between the patient groups receiving aripiprazole and placebo , which showed potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed no medically significant differences .
Increases in CPK ( creatine phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with aripiprazole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
Other findings :
Adverse reactions that may occur in connection with antipsychotic therapy , which have also been reported in treatment with aripiprazole , include malignant neuroleptic syndrome , late dyskinesia and seizures , adverse cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus ( see Section 4.4 ) .

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and since the market launch , unintentional or intentional acute overdoses of aripiprazole have been observed in adult patients alone with an estimated dose of up to 1260 mg and no fatal consequences .
Potentially medically relevant signs and symptoms included lethargy , high blood pressure , drowsiness , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , unintentional aripiprazole overdoses ( up to 195 mg ) have been reported without causing death in children .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms that were reported included drowsiness , temporary loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Treatment of an overdose should focus on supportive measures , respiratory clearance , oxygen supply and ventilation , as well as symptomatic treatment .
The possibility of multiple drug participation should be considered .
Therefore , immediate monitoring of cardiovascular functions should be initiated , including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to identify possible arrhythmias .
After each present or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical monitoring is advisable until the patient has recovered .
This suggests that coal may be an effective remedy in treating an overdose .
Although no information is available on the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole , hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in the treatment of an overdose as aripiprazole has a high plasma protein involvement .

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties
Antipsychotics , ATC code :
N05AX12
57 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole showed antagonistic properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonistic properties in dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptors and to serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha @-@ 1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptor .
In addition , aripiprazole showed a moderate affinity to the serotonin reuptake site and no significant affinity to muscarin receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than the dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
When administering aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy subjects , positron emission tomography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-racloprid , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate nucleus and to the putamen .
More information on clinical trials :
Schizophrenia :
In three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the success of the therapy in the further treatment of patients who initially responded to the treatment .
In a haloperidol @-@ controlled study , at week 52 , the proportion of responders who maintained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperizole 73 % ) .
The overall rate of patients who completed the study was significantly higher in patients receiving aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than in the haloperizole group ( 30 % ) .
Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including PANSS and the Montgomery asbestos depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol .
In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole showed a significantly higher relapse rate , which was 34 % in the aripiprazole group and 57 % below placebo .
In clinical studies , no clinically relevant weight gain occurred with aripiprazole .
In a 26 @-@ week , olanzapine @-@ controlled , multinational , double @-@ blind schizophrenia study involving 314 patients , in which the primary study objective was &quot; weight gain , &quot; significantly fewer patients gained weight by at least 7 % compared to baseline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx .
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In two placebo @-@ controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole showed superior efficacy over placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These studies included patients with or without psychotic traits and with or without rapid @-@ cycling history .
In a placebo @-@ controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage in patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder , aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
In two placebo and activity @-@ controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole showed superior efficacy over placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12 .
Aripiprazole also had a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .
58 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder , with or without psychotic features , some of which did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy at therapeutic serum levels for 2 weeks , adjuvant therapy with aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole showed to be superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of bipolar relapse , mainly in the prevention of relapse into mania .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties
Aripiprazole melting tablets are bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets with similar absorption rate and similar absorption percentage .
Aripiprazole enamel tablets can be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
Absorption :
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with maximum plasma levels being reached within 3 @-@ 5 hours after intake .
Aripiprazole is subject to a minimal pre @-@ systemic metabolism .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
A meal with high fat content has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Distribution :
Aripiprazole is distributed throughout the body with an apparent distribution volume of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole are bound to more than 99 % of plasma proteins , mainly albumin .
Metabolism :
Dehydration , hydroxylation and N- dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , the N @-@ dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the main component of the drug in the systemic circulation .
40 % of the AUC of aripiprazole in plasma .
Elimination :
The mean elimination half @-@ life is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolizers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours for &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers via CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg , which mainly takes place via the liver .
27 % of the given radioactivity is found in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
18 % were found unchanged in the faeces .
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups
Elderly :
Similarly , the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no age @-@ related effects .
59 Gender :
In aripiprazole , there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects , nor did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients show any sex @-@ related effects .
Smoking and ethnicity :
A population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no evidence of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Renal insufficiency :
The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects .
Liver insufficiency :
A single @-@ dose study in subjects with varying degrees of cirrhosis of the liver ( ChildPugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect with regard to impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the liver class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions about their metabolic capacity .
5.3 Preclinical Safety Data
Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology , repeated administration toxicity , reproductive toxicity , genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential , the preclinical data showed no particular risks to humans .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , thus having limited or no significance for clinical use .
Effects included dose @-@ dependent adrenal cortex toxicity ( lipofuscinous pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats at 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to 3 to 10 times mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adrenal cortex carcinomas and combined adrenal cortex adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
The highest exposure in female rats that did not induce tumors was 7 times higher than the recommended exposure in humans .
In addition , cholelithiasis was detected as a result of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Steady State exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole found in human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the bile of monkeys in the 39 @-@ week study and well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solubility .
Based on the results of the complete standard battery of genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was classified as non @-@ genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not affect fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
In rabbits , these effects were measured after dosages leading to exposure of 3 and 11 times the mean Steady @-@ State AUC at the recommended clinical
Maternal toxic effects occurred in the dose range in which toxic effects on intrauterine development had also been observed .

CLINICAL DATA
4.1 Applications
Aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Dosage , type and duration of use
For taking .
Schizophrenia :
The recommended starting dose for aripiprazole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
Aripiprazole is effective in a dose range between 10 and 30 mg / day .
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Manic episodes :
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder :
In order to prevent the recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have already received aripiprazole , the therapy should be continued at the same dose .
An adjustment of the daily dose , including a dose reduction , should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
63 The enamel tablet should be placed on the tongue , where it dissolves quickly through the saliva in the mouth .
It can be taken with or without fluid .
It is difficult to take an enamel tablet out of the mouth as a whole .
Since the melting tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately after opening the blister pack .
The tablet can also be dissolved in water and the resulting suspension can be drunk .
Patients who have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets can take the enamel tablets as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
There is no experience with children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
In patients with mild to moderate liver failure , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The available data are not sufficient to establish dosage recommendations in patients with severe liver failure .
In these patients , the dosage should be adjusted carefully .
However , the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe liver failure ( see section 5.2 ) .
In patients with renal insufficiency , no adjustment of dosage is required .
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients aged 65 and over has not been demonstrated .
Taking into account the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
In women , no adjustment of dosage is required compared to men ( see section 5.2 ) .
Due to the metabolism of aripiprazole , no dose adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When highly effective CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are given in conjunction with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced .
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
If highly effective CYP3A4 inductors are given together with aripiprazole , the dose of aripiprazole should be increased .
If the CYP3A4 inductor is discontinued from combination therapy , the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , it can take several days to a few weeks for the patient &apos;s clinical condition to improve .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behavior is associated with psychotic disorders and affective disorders have been reported in some cases after the onset or change of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Close monitoring should accompany antipsychotic therapy of high @-@ risk patients .
Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder had no increased risk of suicide with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics .
64 Cardiovascular Diseases :
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , congestive heart failure , transition disorders ) , cerebrovascular diseases , conditions that predispose to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including accelerated and malignant form ) .
Reconciliation disorders :
In clinical studies with aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Late @-@ stage dyskinesia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If a patient treated with ABILIFY shows signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia , it should be considered to reduce the dose or stop treatment .
After stopping treatment , these symptoms can worsen for a short time or even occur .
Malignant neuroleptic syndrome ( MNS ) :
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics .
Rare cases of MNS have been reported in clinical trials during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of MNS are high fever , muscle rigidity , changing states of consciousness and signs of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating and irregular heart rhythms ) .
Other symptoms may include an increase in creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure .
However , also increases in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , which were not necessarily associated with MNS , were reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate MNS , or has an unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS , all antipsychotics , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizures : Occasional seizures during treatment with aripiprazole have been reported in clinical studies .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or conditions related to seizures .
Elderly patients with dementia @-@ associated psychosis :
In three placebo controlled studies ( n = 938 , mean age :
82.4 years ; range :
56 - 99 years ) with aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Cerebrovascular adverse events :
stroke , transitory ischemic attack ) including deaths in patients ( mean age :
84 years , Area :
78 - 88 years ) .
Overall , 1.3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole reported adverse cerebrovascular events compared to 0.6 % of patients treated with placebo in these studies .
The difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these studies , a fixed @-@ dose study , there was a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of psychosis associated with dementia .
Risk factors that could cause
65 patients can be predisposed to serious complications , including obesity and diabetes in the family history .
There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be screened for signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia ( such as :
polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening glucose levels .
Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities , the use of antipsychotics where weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
Weight gain was reported after market launch in patients prescribed ABILIFY .
In the observed cases , patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes , thyroid disease or pituitary adenoma in their medical history .
In clinical studies , aripiprazole has not led to clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Motility disorders of the esophagus and aspiration have been associated with the intake of antipsychotic medications , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicines should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia ,
Patients with phenylketonuria :
ABILIFY enamel tablets contain aspartame as a source of phenylalanine , which can be harmful for patients with phenylketonuria .
As with other medicinal products , hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur when taking aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other interactions
Due to its α @-@ adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole can enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Because of the primary effect of aripiprazole on the central nervous system , caution should be exercised when taking aripiprazole in combination with alcohol or other centrally active medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Aripiprazole should be taken cautiously with other medicines that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte balance disturbances .
Possible influence of other medicines on ABILIFY :
The H2 antagonist famotidine , a gastric acid blocker , reduces the absorption rate of aripiprazole , although this effect is not considered clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolized in various ways involving the enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 , but not the CYP1A enzymes .
Therefore , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor ( quinidine ) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107 % while the Cmax remained unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydroaripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % respectively .
The ABILIFY dose should be reduced to about half of the prescribed dose if
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , are expected to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
37 % .
43 % .
In CYP2D6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolizers , joint use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering the combined administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When ketoconazole is given in conjunction with ABILIFY , the ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose .
Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
After discontinuing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level before the start of the adjuvant therapy .
Diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY , a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations can be expected .
73 % lower compared to monotherapy with aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) .
Similarly , for dehydroaripiprazole , the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after combined use with carbamazepine decreased by 69 % and
71 % lower than after monotherapy with aripiprazole .
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is given in conjunction with carbamazepine .
It is expected that other highly effective inductors of CYP3A4 ( such as rifampicin , rifabutin , phenytoin , phenobarbital , primidone , efavirenz , nevirapin and St. John &apos;s wort ) have similar effects and therefore similar dosage increases should be made .
After discontinuing the highly effective CYP3A4 inductors , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium was taken at the same time as aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Possible influence of ABILIFY on other medicines :
In clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of aripiprazole per day did not significantly affect the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan / 3 @-@ methoxymorphine ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
In addition , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole showed no potential for a change in the metabolism mediated by CYP1A2 in vitro .
Therefore , aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes .
If aripiprazole was taken at the same time as valproate or lithium , there was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
In animal studies , potential disorders of intrauterine development could not be excluded ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole
Due to insufficient data on human safety and concerns raised in animal reproduction studies , this medicine must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted into the milk of lactating rats .
Since it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk , patients should be advised not to breastfeed while taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery
No studies have been carried out on the effects on roadworthiness and the ability to operate machinery .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be warned not to use dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect on them .
