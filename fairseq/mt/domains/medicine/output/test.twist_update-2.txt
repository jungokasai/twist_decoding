What is Abiliary?
Abiliary is a medicine containing the active substance aripiprazole.
It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as an oral solution (1 mg / ml) and as a solution for injection (7.5 mg / ml).
What is Abiliary used for?
Schizophrenia is a mental illness that has a number of episodes (e. g. disorganised thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), suspiciousness and delusions; • bipolar I disorder, a psychiatric disorder in patients who have manic episodes with normal periods.
Depression can also occur.
Abiliary is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in the past in patients who have responded to the medicine.
The solution for injection is used to rapidly control restlessness or behavioural problems when oral intake of the medicine is not possible.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Abiliary used?
For schizophrenia, the recommended starting dose is 10 or 15 mg per day.
The maintenance dose is 15 mg once a day, but in some patients, may also be beneficial at higher doses.
For bipolar disorder, the recommended starting dose is 15 mg once daily, either alone or in combination with other medicinal products.
A higher dose may also be helpful in some patients.
For the prevention of manic episodes, the same dose should be continued.
For both conditions, the oral solution or orodispersible tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.

Abiliary can be taken with or without food.
However, this dose should be used with caution in patients who have severe liver problems.
The dose of Abiliary should be adjusted in patients who are taking other medicines that are broken down in the same way as Abiliary.
Abiliary was not studied in children below the age of 18 and adults over 65 years.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
How does Abiliary work?
The active substance in Abiliary, aripiprazole, is an antipsychotic medicine.
Its exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it attaches to several receptors on the surface of nerve cells in the brain.
This interferes with signalling between brain cells by ‘ neurotransmitters ’, when chemicals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other.
Mechanism of action: aripiprazole is most likely to be ‘ partial agonist ’ for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytrypamine (also called serotonin).
This means that aripiprazole, such as 5-hydroxytrypamine and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters, works to activate receptors.
Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine are a involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, aripiprazole helps to normalise the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevent its reappearance.
How has Abiliary been studied?
The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was examined in three studies lasting up to a year.
In two of these studies, haloperidol (another antipsychotic medicine) was used as a comparator medicine.
The effectiveness of the injection was compared with a placebo in two studies involving 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar conditions that had an increased restlessness over a period of two hours.
In all studies, the change in symptoms was measured by a standard scale for schizophrenia.
For the treatment of bipolar disorder, eight main studies were carried out in which Abilis were administered orally.
In five short-term studies, the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo was compared over three weeks in a total of 1,900 patients.
These studies were continued for an additional nine weeks in order to maintain the effect of the medicine.
An additional study compared Abiliary in 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study to prevent the efficacy of Abiliary and placebo, in preventing the return of recurrence, 160 patients who had already been stabilised with Abiliary disease.
In clinical trials, patients were treated with lithium or valproate (another antipsychotic medicine) and compared with placebo in 384 patients.
The efficacy of Abiliary solution for injection was compared with that of lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder who had an increased restlessness compared to that of lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) over two hours.
In all studies, the change in symptoms was measured by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.
The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbed and the oral solution is absorbed (taking).
What benefit has Abiliary shown during the studies?
When used to treat schizophrenia, Abiliary was more effective than placebo in the short-term studies.
In the long-term studies, Abilis were more effective than placebo in reducing the duration of treatment and as effective as haloperidol after up to one year of treatment.
In the two studies of the injection solution, patients who received Abiliary doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg had a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than those who received placebo.
When used to treat bipolar disorder, Abiliary dysfunction was more effective than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.
Abilify also had a similar effect, such as haloperidol and lithium, over three weeks.
This effect was maintained for up to 12 weeks.
In addition, AbiliD was more effective than placebo in preventing recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when added to existing treatment for up to 74 weeks.
Abiliary injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also was more effective than placebo at reducing symptoms of agitation and were similar to lorazepam.
What is the risk associated with Abiliary?
The most common side effects with Abiliary (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled conditions), akathisia (difficulty in movement), tremor (shaking movements), somnolence (drowsiness), sedation (sleepiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (heartburn), vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), constipation (being sick), salivary hypersecretion (increased production of salivary hypersecretion), fatigue (tiredness), restlessness, insomnia (difficulty sleeping) and anxiety.
Akathisia is more common in patients with bipolar disorder than in patients with schizophrenia.
Somnolence (drowsiness), dizziness, headache, akathisia, nausea and vomiting occur in 1 to 10 patients out of 100 treated with Abiliary injections.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abilis, see the Package Leaflet.
Abiliary should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to aripiprazole or any of the other ingredients.
Why has Abiliary been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Abiliary ’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes, and in whom manic episodes responded to treatment with aripiprazole.
In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection were greater in rapid control of agitation and behaviour in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is inappropriate, to outweigh the risks.
The Committee recommended that Abiliary be given marketing authorisation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose of ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg per day, with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day with or without food.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day.
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated, although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode:
The recommended starting dose of ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, with or without food as monotherapy or in combination (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder:
For the prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in patients already receiving aripiprazole, therapy should be continued at the same dose.
Adjustment of daily dose, including a reduction of dosage, should be considered based on clinical status.
There is no experience in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency.
The available data are insufficient to establish dosage recommendations for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.
The dosage should be conservative in these patients.
However, the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency.
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patients ≥ 65 years of age has not been demonstrated.
A lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
No dose adjustment is necessary for women compared to men (see section 5.2).
Based on the metabolism of aripiprazole, no dosage adjustment is necessary for smoking (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are co-administered with aripiprazole, the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced.
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 inducers are co-administered with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
If the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored during this period.
The onset of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disturbances, and has been reported in some cases after initiation of antipsychotic therapy, including aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close monitoring should include antipsychotic therapy in patients at high risk.
Data from one epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicidal behaviour in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aaripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular conditions, conditions which predisposed to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines) or hypertension (including accelerated and malignant).
Overdose:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was similar to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive dyskinesia: in clinical trials, one year or less alertness, there were uncommon reports of dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in one patient on ABILIFY, a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
If treatment is stopped, these symptoms can become worse or even arise.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics.
NMS, in clinical trials, rare cases of NMS have been reported during aripiprazole treatment.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevations in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis have also been reported in some cases with NMS.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or has unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizures: in clinical studies, seizures have been reported uncommonly during aripiprazole treatment.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia associated with dementia:
In three placebo-controlled studies (n = 938, mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56 - 99 years) with aripiprazole in patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease were associated with an increased risk of death when compared to placebo.
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5% compared to 1.7% for placebo.
Cerebrovascular adverse events:
In the same clinical trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e. g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) including fatalities, were observed in patients (mean age:
84 years, range:
78 - 88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of patients treated with aripiprazole reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared to 0.6% of patients treated with placebo in these trials.
The difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these studies, a fixed dose study, a significant relationship between dose and dose escalation was seen in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia associated with dementia.
Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarcoma, death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to serious complications include obesity and a family history of diabetes.
There are no specific risk estimations for hyperglycaemic related adverse events in ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medicinal products treated patients that directly comparisons.
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (e. g.
In patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness, and patients with diabetes mellitus or at risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbipolar disorder, antipsychotics, where weight increase is known or uncommon, and could result in serious complications.
Weight gain has been reported in patients prescribed ABILIFY in post-marketing experience.
In the observed cases, patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes, thyroid disease or pituitary gland adenoma.
In clinical studies, aripiprazole has not resulted in clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Motility disorders of the oesophagus and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotic medicinal products including ABILIFY.
Agents such as aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicines should be used with caution in patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take ABILIFY.
As with other medicinal products, hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms that occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole may potentiate the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
Because of the primary effects of aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution should be exercised when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, such as sedation (see section 4.8).
Apiprazole should be used with caution with other medicinal products that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of absorption of aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered to be clinically significant.
Mechanism of action: aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but not CYP1A enzymes.
Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for smoking.
In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (quinidine) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107%, while Cmax remained unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and by 47%.
The ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose when administered with quinidine.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
The absolute bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of sitagliptin is approximately 37%.
Voriconazole increased Cmax and AUCτ of rifabutin by 18% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, coadministration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.
When used concomitantly with ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks for the patient.
The dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
After discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level consistent before initiation of concomitant therapy.
Concomitant use of ABILIFY and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 activity (e. g. diltiazem or scitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY may be expected with a modest increase in aripiprazole concentrations.
A single 125 mg dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC and Cmax of diclofenac by approximately 29% and 73%, respectively, when compared to aripiprazole alone (30 mg).
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of aripiprazole was approximately 71% lower than with aripiprazole alone.
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is co-administered with carbamazepine.
It is expected that other potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, efavirenz, nevirapine and St.
After withdrawal of the high-acting CYP3A4 inducers, the dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were co-administered with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical trials, doses of 10 to 30 mg aripiprazole per day did not have a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
In addition, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not have any potential for an alteration in CYP1A2 in vitro.
Therefore, aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes.
There was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations when aripiprazole was co-administered with valproate.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
In animal studies, potential intrauterine development disturbances were not excluded (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety data in humans and the animal reproduction studies, this medicinal product must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Apiprazole is excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
As it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk, patients should be advised not to breast-feed while taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to avoid hazardous machinery, including driving, until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than with placebo or were classified as possible medically significant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1 / 100, < 1 / 10); uncommon (> 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 100).
Depression *
Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia A long-term controlled trial of 52 weeks duration in patients treated with aripiprazole had a lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and dyskinesia, compared with patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients treated with placebo.
In another long-term controlled study of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients treated with olanzapine.
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a 12-week controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 53.3% in patients treated with haloperidol.
In another 12 week study, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long-term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.7% for placebo.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
For schizophrenic patients, the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparison between the patient groups with aripiprazole and placebo in which the potential clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.
Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients compared with 2.0% of placebo-treated patients.
Other findings:
Adverse reactions that may occur in association with antipsychotic therapy and have been reported with aripiprazole treatment, include malignant neuroleptic malignant syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events, and increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia, hyperglycaemia, and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).
Post-marketing:
The following adverse events were reported during post-marketing surveillance.
The frequency of these events is not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Investigations:
Increased creatine phosphokinase, increased blood glucose, changes in blood glucose, increased glycosylated haemoglobin

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and since post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose with aripiprazole alone has been reported to result in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without mortality.
Potentially medically significant signs and symptoms included lethargy, increased blood pressure, drowsiness, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, unintentional aripiprazole overdoses (up to 195 mg) have been reported without mortality in children.
potentially medically significant signs and symptoms have been reported, included drowsiness, temporary loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Treatment of overdose should focus on supportive measures, in order to maintain airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and symptomatic treatment.
The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.
Therefore, cardiovascular function should be instituted immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to identify possible arrhythmias.
After any present or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision is indicated until the patient recovers.
This indicates that charcoal may be an effective agent in the treatment of overdose.
Although information is not available on the efficacy of haemodialysis treatment of overdose with aripiprazole; however, haemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit in the treatment of overdose, since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics: diazepines, oxazepines and thiazepines, ATC code:
N05AX12
It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Apiprazole exhibited antagonistic properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonistic properties in dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Ariprazole was high in vitro affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor, and for serotonin 5 HT1a and 5 HT2a receptor, as well as modest affinity for dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2 and 5HT7, for alpha-1-adrenergic, and for histamine H1 receptor.
The interaction of rifabutin and VIRAMUNE has not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of an interaction is unknown.
9 other receptors than the dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
When aripiprazole was administered at doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease in binding of 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the nucleus and putamen.
Other information about clinical studies:
Schizophrenia:
In three placebo-controlled short-term clinical trials (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole demonstrated a statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptoms compared with placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the outcome of the treatment in patients who have responded to the initial treatment.
In a haloperivered controlled trial, at week 52 of responder patients who contained a response to study drug containing the study drug was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall rate of patients who have completed study was significantly higher in aripiprazole (43%) than in the haloperidol group (30%).
Current values from measuring regimen defined as secondary trial objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression rate, showed a significantly greater improvement than haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled study of patients stabilised with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole demonstrated a significantly higher reduction of relapse rate, 34% in the aripiprazole group and 57% on placebo.
There was no clinically significant weight gain with aripiprazole in clinical trials.
In a 26-week, double-blind, multinational study of schizophrenia, which included 314 patients and at the primary objective of weight gain, aripiprazole (N = 18 or 13% of the evaluable patient analyses) demonstrated a at least 7% increase from baseline in weight (i. e., at least 5.6 kg, on average, of approx.
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder:
In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of flexible dose monotherapy trials over 3 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These studies included patients with or without psychotic characteristics, with or without Rapid restrictions.
In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 week duration, in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated no superior efficacy compared to placebo.
In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials of 12 week duration in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance effect similar to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
10 aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission of mania to lithium or haloperidol at Week 12.
In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 week patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy, concomitant therapy with aripiprazole resulted in overt efficacy when compared to lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled study followed by a long-term follow-up period of 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilisation period, aripiprazole was superior to placebo in terms of prevention of bipolar recurrence, predominantly for the prevention of relapse in mania.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Apiprazole is well absorbed, reaching maximum plasma concentrations within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver and aripiprazole undergoes minimal presystemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
A meal with high fat content does not affect the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Apiprazole is distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are bound to plasma proteins more than 99%, mainly albumin.
Metabolism:
Dehydration, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
What ABILIFY contains The major circulating component of aripiprazole is the systemic circulation.
The bioavailability of aripiprazole is approximately 40% of the plasma AUC of aripiprazole.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-life is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolisers by CYP2D6 and in approximately 146 hours for poor metabolisers with CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg, which occurs primarily by the liver.
Approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Elderly:
Similarly, the pharmacokinetic assessment of schizophrenic patients did not show age-related effects.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between male and female healthy subjects, nor in a pharmacokinetic study in schizophrenic patients, without gender related effects.
Smoking and Race:
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no clinically significant differences in race or smoking effect of aripiprazole on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole.
Renal insufficiency:
The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydroxy aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal impairment compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic insufficiency:
A single dose study in volunteers with varying degrees of hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) has shown no significant effect on hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroxy aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which did not undergo any significant effect on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were seen only at doses or exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or in humans to have limited or no relevance to clinical use.
Effects included dose-related adrenal cortical toxicity (lipofoetal pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks of treatment in rats at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose) and an increase in adrenal cortical carcinomas and combined adrenal cortical adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (60 times the mean steady-state AUC exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest exposure in female rats that did not induce tumour was 7 times higher than the human exposure.
In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a consequence of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys following repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- 81-fold the maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis.
However, the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg was not more than 6% of the concentrations of sulfate conjugate of hydroxyaripiprazole observed in the human GIST study, which were well below the threshold (6%) in vitro solubility study over 39 weeks.
Based on the results of full battery of standard battery of genotoxicity studies, aripiprazole was considered not genotoxic.
Apiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
In rabbits, these effects were observed at doses that resulted in exposure 3-and 11-fold the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxic effects occurred in the dose range, in which the toxic effects were also seen on intrauterine development.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose of ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg per day, with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day with or without food.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day.
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated, although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode:
The recommended starting dose of ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, with or without food as monotherapy or in combination (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder:
For the prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in patients already receiving aripiprazole, therapy should be continued at the same dose.
Adjustment of daily dose, including a reduction of dosage, should be considered based on clinical status.
There is no experience in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency.
The available data are insufficient to establish dosage recommendations for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.
The dosage should be conservative in these patients.
However, the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency.
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patients ≥ 65 years of age has not been demonstrated.
A lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
No dose adjustment is necessary for women compared to men (see section 5.2).
Based on the metabolism of aripiprazole, no dosage adjustment is necessary for smoking (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are co-administered with aripiprazole, the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced.
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 inducers are co-administered with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
If the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored during this period.
The onset of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disturbances, and has been reported in some cases after initiation of antipsychotic therapy, including aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close monitoring should include antipsychotic therapy in patients at high risk.
Data from one epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicidal behaviour in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aaripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular conditions, conditions which predisposed to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines) or hypertension (including accelerated and malignant).
Overdose:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was similar to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive dyskinesia: in clinical trials, one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in one patient on ABILIFY, a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
If treatment is stopped, these symptoms can become worse or even arise.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics.
NMS, in clinical trials, rare cases of NMS have been reported during aripiprazole treatment.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevations in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis have also been reported in some cases with NMS.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or has unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizures: in clinical studies, seizures have been reported uncommonly during aripiprazole treatment.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia associated with dementia:
In three placebo-controlled studies (n = 938, mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56 - 99 years) with aripiprazole in patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease were associated with an increased risk of death when compared to placebo.
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5% compared to 1.7% for placebo.
Cerebrovascular adverse events:
In the same clinical trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e. g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) including fatalities, were observed in patients (mean age:
84 years, range:
78 - 88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of patients treated with aripiprazole reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared to 0.6% of patients treated with placebo in these trials.
The difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these studies, a fixed dose study, a significant relationship between dose and dose escalation was seen in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia associated with dementia.
Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarcoma, death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to serious complications include obesity and a family history of diabetes.
There are no specific risk estimations for hyperglycaemic related adverse events in ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medicinal products treated patients that directly comparisons.
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (e. g.
In patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness, and patients with diabetes mellitus or at risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbipolar disorder, antipsychotics, where weight increase is known or uncommon, and could result in serious complications.
Weight gain has been reported in patients prescribed ABILIFY in post-marketing experience.
In the observed cases, patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes, thyroid disease or pituitary gland adenoma.
In clinical studies, aripiprazole has not resulted in clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Motility disorders of the oesophagus and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotic medicinal products including ABILIFY.
Agents such as aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicines should be used with caution in patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take ABILIFY.
As with other medicinal products, hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms that occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole may potentiate the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
Because of the primary effects of aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution should be exercised when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, such as sedation (see section 4.8).
Apiprazole should be used with caution with other medicinal products that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of absorption of aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered to be clinically significant.
Mechanism of action: aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but not CYP1A enzymes.
Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for smoking.
In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (quinidine) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107%, while Cmax remained unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and by 47%.
The ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose when administered with quinidine.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
The absolute bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of sitagliptin is approximately 37%.
Voriconazole increased Cmax and AUCτ of rifabutin by 18% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, coadministration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.
When used concomitantly with ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks for the patient.
The dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
After discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level consistent before initiation of concomitant therapy.
Concomitant use of ABILIFY and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 activity (e. g. diltiazem or scitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY may be expected with a modest increase in aripiprazole concentrations.
A single 125 mg dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC and Cmax of diclofenac by approximately 29% and 73%, respectively, when compared to aripiprazole alone (30 mg).
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of aripiprazole was approximately 71% lower than with aripiprazole alone.
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is co-administered with carbamazepine.
It is expected that other potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, efavirenz, nevirapine and St.
After withdrawal of the high-acting CYP3A4 inducers, the dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were co-administered with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical trials, doses of 10 to 30 mg aripiprazole per day did not have a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
In addition, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not have any potential for an alteration in CYP1A2 in vitro.
Therefore, aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes.
There was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations when aripiprazole was co-administered with valproate.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
In animal studies, potential intrauterine development disturbances were not excluded (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety data in humans and the animal reproduction studies, this medicinal product must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Apiprazole is excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
As it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk, patients should be advised not to breast-feed while taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to avoid hazardous machinery, including driving, until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than with placebo or were classified as possible medically significant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1 / 100, < 1 / 10); uncommon (> 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 100).
Depression *
Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia A long-term controlled trial of 52 weeks duration in patients treated with aripiprazole had a lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and dyskinesia, compared with patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients treated with placebo.
In another long-term controlled study of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients treated with olanzapine.
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a 12-week controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 53.3% in patients treated with haloperidol.
In another 12 week study, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long-term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.7% for placebo.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
For schizophrenic patients, the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparison between the patient groups with aripiprazole and placebo in which the potential clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.
Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients compared with 2.0% of placebo-treated patients.
Other findings:
Adverse reactions that may occur in association with antipsychotic therapy and have been reported with aripiprazole treatment including neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia and convulsions, adverse cerebrovascular events, and increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia, hyperglycaemia, and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and since post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose with aripiprazole alone has been reported to result in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without mortality.
Potentially medically significant signs and symptoms included lethargy, increased blood pressure, drowsiness, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, unintentional aripiprazole overdoses (up to 195 mg) have been reported without mortality in children.
potentially medically significant signs and symptoms have been reported, included drowsiness, temporary loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Treatment of overdose should focus on supportive measures, in order to maintain airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and symptomatic treatment.
The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.
Therefore, cardiovascular function should be instituted immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to identify possible arrhythmias.
After any present or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision is indicated until the patient recovers.
This indicates that charcoal may be an effective agent in the treatment of overdose.
Although information is not available on the efficacy of haemodialysis treatment of overdose with aripiprazole; however, haemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit in the treatment of overdose, since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics: diazepines, oxazepines and thiazepines, ATC code:
N05AX12
It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Apiprazole exhibited antagonistic properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonistic properties in dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Ariprazole was high in vitro affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor, and for serotonin 5 HT1a and 5 HT2a receptor, as well as modest affinity for dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2 and 5HT7, for alpha-1-adrenergic, and for histamine H1 receptor.
The interaction of rifabutin and VIRAMUNE has not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of an interaction is unknown.
As with other receptors other than the dopamine and serotonin subtypes, some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole may explain.
When aripiprazole was administered at doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease in binding of 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the nucleus and putamen.
Other information about clinical studies:
Schizophrenia:
In three placebo-controlled short-term clinical trials (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole demonstrated a statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptoms compared with placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the outcome of the treatment in patients who have responded to the initial treatment.
In a haloperivered controlled trial, at week 52 of responder patients who contained a response to study drug containing the study drug was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall rate of patients who have completed study was significantly higher in aripiprazole (43%) than in the haloperidol group (30%).
Current values from measuring regimen defined as secondary trial objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression rate, showed a significantly greater improvement than haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled study of patients stabilised with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole demonstrated a significantly higher reduction of relapse rate, 34% in the aripiprazole group and 57% on placebo.
There was no clinically significant weight gain with aripiprazole in clinical trials.
In a 26-week, double-blind, multinational study of schizophrenia, which included 314 patients and at the primary objective of weight gain, aripiprazole (N = 18 or 13% of the evaluable patient analyses) demonstrated a at least 7% increase from baseline in weight (i. e., at least 5.6 kg, on average, of approx.
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder:
In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of flexible dose monotherapy trials over 3 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These studies included patients with or without psychotic characteristics, with or without Rapid restrictions.
In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 week duration, in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated no superior efficacy compared to placebo.
In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials of 12 week duration in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance effect similar to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
10 aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission of mania to lithium or haloperidol at Week 12.
In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 week patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy, concomitant therapy with aripiprazole resulted in overt efficacy when compared to lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled study followed by a long-term follow-up period of 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilisation period, aripiprazole was superior to placebo in terms of prevention of bipolar recurrence, predominantly for the prevention of relapse in mania.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Apiprazole is well absorbed, reaching maximum plasma concentrations within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver and aripiprazole undergoes minimal presystemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
A meal with high fat content does not affect the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Apiprazole is distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are bound to plasma proteins more than 99%, mainly albumin.
Metabolism:
Dehydration, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
What ABILIFY contains The major circulating component of aripiprazole is the systemic circulation.
The bioavailability of aripiprazole is approximately 40% of the plasma AUC of aripiprazole.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-life is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolisers by CYP2D6 and in approximately 146 hours for poor metabolisers with CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg, which occurs primarily by the liver.
Approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Elderly:
Similarly, the pharmacokinetic assessment of schizophrenic patients did not show age-related effects.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between male and female healthy subjects, nor in a pharmacokinetic study in schizophrenic patients, without gender related effects.
Smoking and Race:
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no clinically significant differences in race or smoking effect of aripiprazole on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole.
Renal insufficiency:
The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydroxy aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal impairment compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic insufficiency:
A single dose study in volunteers with varying degrees of hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) has shown no significant effect on hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroxy aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which did not undergo any significant effect on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were seen only at doses or exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or in humans to have limited or no relevance to clinical use.
Effects included dose-related adrenal cortical toxicity (lipofoetal pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks of treatment in rats at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose) and an increase in adrenal cortical carcinomas and combined adrenal cortical adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (60 times the mean steady-state AUC exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest exposure in female rats that did not induce tumour was 7 times higher than the human exposure.
In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a consequence of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys following repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- 81-fold the maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis.
However, the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg was not more than 6% of the concentrations of sulfate conjugate of hydroxyaripiprazole observed in the human GIST study, which were well below the threshold (6%) in vitro solubility study over 39 weeks.
Based on the results of full battery of standard battery of genotoxicity studies, aripiprazole was considered not genotoxic.
Apiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
In rabbits, these effects were observed at doses that resulted in exposure 3-and 11-fold the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxic effects occurred in the dose range, in which the toxic effects were also seen on intrauterine development.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose of ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg per day, with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day with or without food.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day.
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated, although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode:
The recommended starting dose of ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, with or without food as monotherapy or in combination (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder:
For the prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in patients already receiving aripiprazole, therapy should be continued at the same dose.
Adjustment of daily dose, including a reduction of dosage, should be considered based on clinical status.
There is no experience in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency.
The available data are insufficient to establish dosage recommendations for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.
The dosage should be conservative in these patients.
However, the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency.
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patients ≥ 65 years of age has not been demonstrated.
A lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
No dose adjustment is necessary for women compared to men (see section 5.2).
Based on the metabolism of aripiprazole, no dosage adjustment is necessary for smoking (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are co-administered with aripiprazole, the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced.
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 inducers are co-administered with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
If the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored during this period.
The onset of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disturbances, and has been reported in some cases after initiation of antipsychotic therapy, including aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close monitoring should include antipsychotic therapy in patients at high risk.
Data from one epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicidal behaviour in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aaripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular conditions, conditions which predisposed to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines) or hypertension (including accelerated and malignant).
Overdose:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was similar to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive dyskinesia: in clinical trials, one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in one patient on ABILIFY, a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
If treatment is stopped, these symptoms can become worse or even arise.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics.
NMS, in clinical trials, rare cases of NMS have been reported during aripiprazole treatment.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevations in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis have also been reported in some cases with NMS.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or has unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizures: in clinical studies, seizures have been reported uncommonly during aripiprazole treatment.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia associated with dementia:
In three placebo-controlled studies (n = 938, mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56 - 99 years) with aripiprazole in patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease were associated with an increased risk of death when compared to placebo.
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5% compared to 1.7% for placebo.
Cerebrovascular adverse events:
In the same clinical trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e. g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) including fatalities, were observed in patients (mean age:
84 years, range:
78 - 88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of patients treated with aripiprazole reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared to 0.6% of patients treated with placebo in these trials.
The difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these studies, a fixed dose study, a significant relationship between dose and dose escalation was seen in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia associated with dementia.
Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarcoma, death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to serious complications include obesity and a family history of diabetes.
There are no specific risk estimations for hyperglycaemic related adverse events in ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medicinal products treated patients that directly comparisons.
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (e. g.
In patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness, and patients with diabetes mellitus or at risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbipolar disorder, antipsychotics, where weight increase is known or uncommon, and could result in serious complications.
Weight gain has been reported in patients prescribed ABILIFY in post-marketing experience.
In the observed cases, patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes, thyroid disease or pituitary gland adenoma.
In clinical studies, aripiprazole has not resulted in clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Motility disorders of the oesophagus and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotic medicinal products including ABILIFY.
Agents such as aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicines should be used with caution in patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take ABILIFY.
As with other medicinal products, hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms that occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole may potentiate the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
Because of the primary effects of aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution should be exercised when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, such as sedation (see section 4.8).
Apiprazole should be used with caution with other medicinal products that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of absorption of aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered to be clinically significant.
Mechanism of action: aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but not CYP1A enzymes.
Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for smoking.
In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (quinidine) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107%, while Cmax remained unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and by 47%.
The ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose when administered with quinidine.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
The absolute bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of sitagliptin is approximately 37%.
Voriconazole increased Cmax and AUCτ of rifabutin by 18% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, coadministration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.
When used concomitantly with ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks for the patient.
The dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
After discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level consistent before initiation of concomitant therapy.
Concomitant use of ABILIFY and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 activity (e. g. diltiazem or scitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY may be expected with a modest increase in aripiprazole concentrations.
A single 125 mg dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC and Cmax of diclofenac by approximately 29% and 73%, respectively, when compared to aripiprazole alone (30 mg).
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of aripiprazole was approximately 71% lower than with aripiprazole alone.
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is co-administered with carbamazepine.
It is expected that other potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, efavirenz, nevirapine and St.
After withdrawal of the high-acting CYP3A4 inducers, the dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were co-administered with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical trials, doses of 10 to 30 mg aripiprazole per day did not have a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
In addition, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not have any potential for an alteration in CYP1A2 in vitro.
Therefore, aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes.
There was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations when aripiprazole was co-administered with valproate.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
In animal studies, potential intrauterine development disturbances were not excluded (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety data in humans and the animal reproduction studies, this medicinal product must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Apiprazole is excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
As it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk, patients should be advised not to breast-feed while taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to avoid hazardous machinery, including driving, until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than with placebo or were classified as possible medically significant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1 / 100, < 1 / 10); uncommon (> 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 100).
Depression *
Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia A long-term controlled trial of 52 weeks duration in patients treated with aripiprazole had a lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and dyskinesia, compared with patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients treated with placebo.
In another long-term controlled study of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients treated with olanzapine.
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a 12-week controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 53.3% in patients treated with haloperidol.
In another 12 week study, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long-term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.7% for placebo.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
For schizophrenic patients, the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparison between the patient groups with aripiprazole and placebo in which the potential clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.
Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients compared with 2.0% of placebo-treated patients.
Other findings:
Adverse reactions that may occur in association with antipsychotic therapy and have been reported with aripiprazole treatment, include malignant neuroleptic malignant syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events, and increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia, hyperglycaemia, and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and since post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose with aripiprazole alone has been reported to result in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without mortality.
Potentially medically significant signs and symptoms included lethargy, increased blood pressure, drowsiness, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, unintentional aripiprazole overdoses (up to 195 mg) have been reported without mortality in children.
potentially medically significant signs and symptoms have been reported, included drowsiness, temporary loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Treatment of overdose should focus on supportive measures, in order to maintain airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and symptomatic treatment.
The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.
Therefore, cardiovascular function should be instituted immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to identify possible arrhythmias.
After any present or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision is indicated until the patient recovers.
This indicates that charcoal may be an effective agent in the treatment of overdose.
Although information is not available on the efficacy of haemodialysis treatment of overdose with aripiprazole; however, haemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit in the treatment of overdose, since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics: diazepines, oxazepines and thiazepines, ATC code:
N05AX12
It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Apiprazole exhibited antagonistic properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonistic properties in dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Ariprazole was high in vitro affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor, and for serotonin 5 HT1a and 5 HT2a receptor, as well as modest affinity for dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2 and 5HT7, for alpha-1-adrenergic, and for histamine H1 receptor.
The interaction of rifabutin and VIRAMUNE has not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of an interaction is unknown.
33 with other receptors other than the dopamine and serotonin subtypes, may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
When aripiprazole was administered at doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease in binding of 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the nucleus and putamen.
Other information about clinical studies:
Schizophrenia:
In three placebo-controlled short-term clinical trials (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole demonstrated a statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptoms compared with placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the outcome of the treatment in patients who have responded to the initial treatment.
In a haloperivered controlled trial, at week 52 of responder patients who contained a response to study drug containing the study drug was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall rate of patients who have completed study was significantly higher in aripiprazole (43%) than in the haloperidol group (30%).
Current values from measuring regimen defined as secondary trial objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression rate, showed a significantly greater improvement than haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled study of patients stabilised with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole demonstrated a significantly higher reduction of relapse rate, 34% in the aripiprazole group and 57% on placebo.
There was no clinically significant weight gain with aripiprazole in clinical trials.
In a 26-week, double-blind, multinational study of schizophrenia, which included 314 patients and at the primary objective of weight gain, aripiprazole (N = 18 or 13% of the evaluable patient analyses) demonstrated a at least 7% increase from baseline in weight (i. e., at least 5.6 kg, on average, of approx.
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder:
In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of flexible dose monotherapy trials over 3 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These studies included patients with or without psychotic characteristics, with or without Rapid restrictions.
In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 week duration, in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated no superior efficacy compared to placebo.
In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials of 12 week duration in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance effect similar to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
10 aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission of mania to lithium or haloperidol at Week 12.
In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 week patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy, concomitant therapy with aripiprazole resulted in overt efficacy when compared to lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled study followed by a long-term extension period of 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilisation period, aripiprazole was superior to placebo in terms of prevention of bipolar recurrence, mainly in the prevention of relapse.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Apiprazole is well absorbed, reaching maximum plasma concentrations within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver and aripiprazole undergoes minimal presystemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
A meal with high fat content does not affect the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Apiprazole is distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are bound to plasma proteins more than 99%, mainly albumin.
Metabolism:
Dehydration, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
What ABILIFY contains The major circulating component of aripiprazole is the systemic circulation.
The bioavailability of aripiprazole is approximately 40% of the plasma AUC of aripiprazole.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-life is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolisers by CYP2D6 and in approximately 146 hours for poor metabolisers with CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg, which occurs primarily by the liver.
Approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Elderly:
Similarly, the pharmacokinetic assessment of schizophrenic patients did not show age-related effects.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between male and female healthy subjects, nor in a pharmacokinetic study in schizophrenic patients, without gender related effects.
Smoking and Race:
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no clinically significant differences in race or smoking effect of aripiprazole on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole.
Renal insufficiency:
The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydroxy aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal impairment compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic insufficiency:
A single dose study in volunteers with varying degrees of hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) has shown no significant effect on hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroxy aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which did not undergo any significant effect on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were seen only at doses or exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or in humans to have limited or no relevance to clinical use.
Effects included dose-related adrenal cortical toxicity (lipofoetal pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks of treatment in rats at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose) and an increase in adrenal cortical carcinomas and combined adrenal cortical adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (60 times the mean steady-state AUC exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest exposure in female rats that did not induce tumour was 7 times higher than the human exposure.
In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a consequence of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys following repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- 81-fold the maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis.
However, the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg was not more than 6% of the concentrations of sulfate conjugate of hydroxyaripiprazole observed in the human GIST study, which were well below the threshold (6%) in vitro solubility study over 39 weeks.
Based on the results of full battery of standard battery of genotoxicity studies, aripiprazole was considered not genotoxic.
Apiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
In rabbits, these effects were observed at doses that resulted in exposure 3-and 11-fold the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxic effects occurred in the dose range, in which the toxic effects were also seen on intrauterine development.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose of ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg per day, with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day with or without food.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day.
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated, although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode:
The recommended starting dose of ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, with or without food as monotherapy or in combination (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder:
For the prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in patients already receiving aripiprazole, therapy should be continued at the same dose.
Adjustment of daily dose, including a reduction of dosage, should be considered based on clinical status.
There is no experience in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency.
The available data are insufficient to establish dosage recommendations for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.
The dosage should be conservative in these patients.
However, the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency.
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patients ≥ 65 years of age has not been demonstrated.
A lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
No dose adjustment is necessary for women compared to men (see section 5.2).
Based on the metabolism of aripiprazole, no dosage adjustment is necessary for smoking (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are co-administered with aripiprazole, the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced.
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 inducers are co-administered with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
If the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored during this period.
The onset of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disturbances, and has been reported in some cases after initiation of antipsychotic therapy, including aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close monitoring should include antipsychotic therapy in patients at high risk.
Data from one epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicidal behaviour in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aaripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular conditions, conditions which predisposed to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines) or hypertension (including accelerated and malignant).
Overdose:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was similar to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive dyskinesia: in clinical trials, one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in one patient on ABILIFY, a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
If treatment is stopped, these symptoms can become worse or even arise.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics.
NMS, in clinical trials, rare cases of NMS have been reported during aripiprazole treatment.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevations in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis have also been reported in some cases with NMS.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or has unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizures: in clinical studies, seizures have been reported uncommonly during aripiprazole treatment.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia associated with dementia:
In three placebo-controlled studies (n = 938, mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56 - 99 years) with aripiprazole in patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease were associated with an increased risk of death when compared to placebo.
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5% compared to 1.7% for placebo.
Cerebrovascular adverse events:
In the same clinical trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e. g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) including fatalities, were observed in patients (mean age:
84 years, range:
78 - 88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of patients treated with aripiprazole reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared to 0.6% of patients treated with placebo in these trials.
The difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these studies, a fixed dose study, a significant relationship between dose and dose escalation was seen in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia associated with dementia.
Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarcoma, death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to serious complications include obesity and a family history of diabetes.
There are no specific risk estimations for hyperglycaemic related adverse events in ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medicinal products treated patients that directly comparisons.
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (e. g.
In patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness, and patients with diabetes mellitus or at risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbipolar disorder, antipsychotics, where weight increase is known or uncommon, and could result in serious complications.
Weight gain has been reported in patients prescribed ABILIFY in post-marketing experience.
In the observed cases, patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes, thyroid disease or pituitary gland adenoma.
In clinical studies, aripiprazole has not resulted in clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Motility disorders of the oesophagus and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotic medicinal products including ABILIFY.
Agents such as aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicines should be used with caution in patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take ABILIFY.
As with other medicinal products, hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms that occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole may potentiate the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
Because of the primary effects of aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution should be exercised when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, such as sedation (see section 4.8).
Apiprazole should be used with caution with other medicinal products that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of absorption of aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered to be clinically significant.
Mechanism of action: aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but not CYP1A enzymes.
Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for smoking.
In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (quinidine) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107%, while Cmax remained unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and by 47%.
The ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose when administered with quinidine.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
The absolute bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of sitagliptin is approximately 37%.
Voriconazole increased Cmax and AUCτ of rifabutin by 18% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, coadministration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.
When used concomitantly with ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks for the patient.
The dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
After discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level consistent before initiation of concomitant therapy.
Concomitant use of ABILIFY and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 activity (e. g. diltiazem or scitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY may be expected with a modest increase in aripiprazole concentrations.
A single 125 mg dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC and Cmax of diclofenac by approximately 29% and 73%, respectively, when compared to aripiprazole alone (30 mg).
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of aripiprazole was approximately 71% lower than with aripiprazole alone.
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is co-administered with carbamazepine.
It is expected that other potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, efavirenz, nevirapine and St.
After withdrawal of the high-acting CYP3A4 inducers, the dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were co-administered with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical trials, doses of 10 to 30 mg aripiprazole per day did not have a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
In addition, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not have any potential for an alteration in CYP1A2 in vitro.
Therefore, aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes.
There was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations when aripiprazole was co-administered with valproate.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
In animal studies, potential intrauterine development disturbances were not excluded (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety data in humans and the animal reproduction studies, this medicinal product must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Apiprazole is excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
As it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk, patients should be advised not to breast-feed while taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to avoid hazardous machinery, including driving, until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than with placebo or were classified as possible medically significant adverse reactions (*):
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1 / 100, < 1 / 10); uncommon (> 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 100).
Depression *
Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia A long-term controlled trial of 52 weeks duration in patients treated with aripiprazole had a lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and dyskinesia, compared with patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients treated with placebo.
In another long-term controlled study of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients treated with olanzapine.
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a 12-week controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 53.3% in patients treated with haloperidol.
In another 12 week study, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long-term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.7% for placebo.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
For schizophrenic patients, the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparison between the patient groups with aripiprazole and placebo in which the potential clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.
Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients compared with 2.0% of placebo-treated patients.
Other findings observed:
Adverse reactions that may occur in association with antipsychotic therapy and have been reported with aripiprazole treatment, include malignant neuroleptic malignant syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events, and increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia, hyperglycaemia, and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and since post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose with aripiprazole alone has been reported to result in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without mortality.
Potentially medically significant signs and symptoms included lethargy, increased blood pressure, drowsiness, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, unintentional aripiprazole overdoses (up to 195 mg) have been reported without mortality in children.
potentially medically significant signs and symptoms have been reported, included drowsiness, temporary loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Treatment of overdose should focus on supportive measures, in order to maintain airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and symptomatic treatment.
The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.
Therefore, cardiovascular function should be instituted immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to identify possible arrhythmias.
After any present or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision is indicated until the patient recovers.
This indicates that charcoal may be an effective agent in the treatment of overdose.
Although information is not available on the efficacy of haemodialysis treatment of overdose with aripiprazole; however, haemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit in the treatment of overdose, since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics: diazepines, oxazepines and thiazepines, ATC code:
N05AX12
It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Apiprazole exhibited antagonistic properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonistic properties in dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Ariprazole was high in vitro affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor, and for serotonin 5 HT1a and 5 HT2a receptor, as well as modest affinity for dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2 and 5HT7, for alpha-1-adrenergic, and for histamine H1 receptor.
The interaction of rifabutin and VIRAMUNE has not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency; however, less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of an interaction is unknown.
48 with other receptors than the dopamine and serotonin subtype may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
When aripiprazole was administered at doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease in binding of 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the nucleus and putamen.
Other information about clinical studies:
Schizophrenia:
In three placebo-controlled short-term clinical trials (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole demonstrated a statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptoms compared with placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the outcome of the treatment in patients who have responded to the initial treatment.
In a haloperivered controlled trial, at week 52 of responder patients who contained a response to study drug containing the study drug was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall rate of patients who have completed study was significantly higher in aripiprazole (43%) than in the haloperidol group (30%).
Current values from measuring regimen defined as secondary trial objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression rate, showed a significantly greater improvement than haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled study of patients stabilised with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole demonstrated a significantly higher reduction of relapse rate, 34% in the aripiprazole group and 57% on placebo.
There was no clinically significant weight gain with aripiprazole in clinical trials.
In a 26-week, double-blind, multinational study of schizophrenia, which included 314 patients and at the primary objective of weight gain, aripiprazole (N = 18 or 13% of the evaluable patient analyses) demonstrated a at least 7% increase from baseline in weight (i. e., at least 5.6 kg, on average, of approx.
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder:
In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of flexible dose monotherapy trials over 3 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These studies included patients with or without psychotic characteristics, with or without Rapid restrictions.
In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 week duration, in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated no superior efficacy compared to placebo.
In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials of 12 week duration in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance effect similar to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
10 aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission of mania to lithium or haloperidol at Week 12.
In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 week patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy, concomitant therapy with aripiprazole resulted in overt efficacy when compared to lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled study followed by a long-term extension period of 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilisation period, aripiprazole was superior to placebo in terms of prevention of bipolar recurrence, predominantly for the prevention of relapse in mania.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Apiprazole is well absorbed, reaching maximum plasma concentrations within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver and aripiprazole undergoes minimal presystemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
A meal with high fat content does not affect the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Apiprazole is distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are bound to plasma proteins more than 99%, mainly albumin.
Metabolism:
Dehydration, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
What ABILIFY contains The major circulating component of aripiprazole is the systemic circulation.
The bioavailability of aripiprazole is approximately 40% of the plasma AUC of aripiprazole.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-life is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolisers by CYP2D6 and in approximately 146 hours for poor metabolisers with CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg, which occurs primarily by the liver.
Approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Elderly:
Similarly, the pharmacokinetic assessment of schizophrenic patients did not show age-related effects.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between male and female healthy subjects, nor in a pharmacokinetic study in schizophrenic patients, without gender related effects.
Smoking and Race:
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no clinically significant differences in race or smoking effect of aripiprazole on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole.
Renal insufficiency:
The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydroxy aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal impairment compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic insufficiency:
A single dose study in volunteers with varying degrees of hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) has shown no significant effect on hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroxy aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which did not undergo any significant effect on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were seen only at doses or exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or in humans to have limited or no relevance to clinical use.
Effects included dose-related adrenal cortical toxicity (lipofoetal pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks of treatment in rats at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose) and an increase in adrenal cortical carcinomas and combined adrenal cortical adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (60 times the mean steady-state AUC exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest exposure in female rats that did not induce tumour was 7 times higher than the human exposure.
In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a consequence of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys following repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- 81-fold the maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis.
However, the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg was not more than 6% of the concentrations of sulfate conjugate of hydroxyaripiprazole observed in the human GIST study, which were well below the threshold (6%) in vitro solubility study over 39 weeks.
Based on the results of full battery of standard battery of genotoxicity studies, aripiprazole was considered not genotoxic.
Apiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
In rabbits, these effects were observed at doses that resulted in exposure 3-and 11-fold the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxic effects occurred in the dose range, in which the toxic effects were also seen on intrauterine development.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Apiprazole is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose of aripiprazole is 10 or 15 mg / day for a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, with or without food.
Mechanism of action: aripiprazole is effective in the dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day.
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated, although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode:
The recommended starting dose of ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, with or without food as monotherapy or in combination (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder:
For the prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in patients already receiving aripiprazole, therapy should be continued at the same dose.
Adjustment of daily dose, including a reduction of dosage, should be considered based on clinical status.
The orodispersible tablet should be placed on the tongue where it dissolves rapidly through the saliva in the mouth.
It can be taken with or without liquid.
It is difficult to withdraw one orodispersible tablet whole from the mouth.
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening the blister.
The tablet may also be dissolved in water and the resulting suspension is drunk.
Patients who have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets may take alternatively the orodispersible tablets of ABILIFY (see section 5.2).
There is no experience in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency.
The available data are insufficient to establish dosage recommendations for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.
The dosage should be conservative in these patients.
However, the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency.
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patients ≥ 65 years of age has not been demonstrated.
A lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
No dose adjustment is necessary for women compared to men (see section 5.2).
Based on the metabolism of aripiprazole, no dosage adjustment is necessary for smoking (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are co-administered with aripiprazole, the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced.
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 inducers are co-administered with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
If the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored during this period.
The onset of suicidal behaviour is one of psychotic disorders and affective disorders have been reported in some cases after initiation of antipsychotic therapy, including aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close monitoring should include antipsychotic therapy in patients at high risk.
Data from one epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicidal behaviour in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aaripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular conditions, conditions which predisposed to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines) or hypertension (including accelerated and malignant).
Overdose:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was similar to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive dyskinesia: in clinical studies where one year or less dyskinesia was reported, there were uncommon reports of dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in one patient on ABILIFY, a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
If treatment is stopped, these symptoms can become worse or even arise.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics.
NMS, in clinical trials, rare cases of NMS have been reported during aripiprazole treatment.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevations in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis have also been reported in some cases with NMS.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or has unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizures: in clinical studies, seizures have been reported uncommonly during aripiprazole treatment.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia associated with dementia:
In three placebo-controlled studies (n = 938, mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56 - 99 years) with aripiprazole in patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease were associated with an increased risk of death when compared to placebo.
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5% compared to 1.7% for placebo.
Cerebrovascular adverse events:
In the same clinical trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e. g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) including fatalities, were observed in patients (mean age:
84 years, range:
78 - 88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of patients treated with aripiprazole reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared to 0.6% of patients treated with placebo in these trials.
The difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these studies, a fixed dose study, a significant relationship between dose and dose escalation was seen in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia associated with dementia.
Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age > 65 years, dysphagia, sedation, malnutrition and dehydration, pulmonary conditions (e. g., pneumonia, with or without aspiration), or concomitant use of benzodiazepines.
52 Patients predisposed to serious complications may include obesity and a family history of diabetes.
There are no specific risk estimations for hyperglycaemic related adverse events in ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medicinal products treated patients that directly comparisons.
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (e. g.
In patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness, and patients with diabetes mellitus or at risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, antipsychotics, where weight increase is known or uncommon, and could result in serious complications.
Weight gain has been reported in patients prescribed ABILIFY in post-marketing experience.
In the observed cases, patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes, thyroid disease or pituitary gland adenoma.
In clinical studies, aripiprazole has not resulted in clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Motility disorders of the oesophagus and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotic medicinal products including ABILIFY.
Agents such as aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicinal products should be used with caution in patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia,
Patients with phenylketonuria:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine, which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.
As with other medicinal products, hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms that occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole may potentiate the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
Because of the primary effects of aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution should be exercised when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, such as sedation (see section 4.8).
Apiprazole should be used with caution with other medicinal products that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of absorption of aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered to be clinically significant.
Mechanism of action: aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but not CYP1A enzymes.
Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for smoking.
In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (quinidine) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107%, while Cmax remained unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and by 47%.
The dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose if:
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
The absolute bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of sitagliptin is approximately 37%.
Voriconazole increased Cmax and AUCτ of rifabutin by 18% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, coadministration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.
When used concomitantly with ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks for the patient.
If ketoconazole is co-administered with ABILIFY the dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
After discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level consistent before initiation of concomitant therapy.
Concomitant use of ABILIFY and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 activity (e. g. diltiazem or scitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY may be expected with a modest increase in aripiprazole concentrations.
A single 125 mg dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC and Cmax of diclofenac by approximately 29% and 73%, respectively, when compared to aripiprazole alone (30 mg).
Dehydration of aripiprazole geometric mean Cmax and AUC were also increased by 69% and 69%, respectively following co-administration with carbamazepine.
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of aripiprazole was approximately 71% lower than with aripiprazole alone.
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is co-administered with carbamazepine.
It is expected that other potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, efavirenz, nevirapine and St.
After withdrawal of the high-acting CYP3A4 inducers, the dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were co-administered with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical trials, doses of 10 to 30 mg aripiprazole per day did not have a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
In addition, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not have any potential for an alteration in CYP1A2 in vitro.
Therefore, aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes.
There was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations when aripiprazole was co-administered with valproate.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
In animal studies, potential intrauterine development disturbances were not excluded (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety data in humans and the animal reproduction studies, this medicinal product must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Apiprazole is excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
As it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk, patients should be advised not to breast-feed while taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to avoid hazardous machinery, including driving, until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions were reported more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than with placebo or were classified as a possible medically important medically significant adverse drug reactions (*):
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1 / 100, < 1 / 10); uncommon (> 1 / 1,000, < 1 / 100).
Depression *
Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS):
Schizophrenia A long-term controlled trial of 52 weeks duration in patients treated with aripiprazole had a lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and dyskinesia, compared with patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients treated with placebo.
In another long-term controlled study of 26 weeks duration, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients treated with olanzapine.
Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a 12-week controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 53.3% in patients treated with haloperidol.
In another 12 week study, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long-term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.7% for placebo.
In the placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
For schizophrenic patients, the incidence of akathisia was 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparison between the patient groups with aripiprazole and placebo in which the potential clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.
Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients compared with 2.0% of placebo-treated patients.
Other findings observed:
Adverse reactions that may occur in association with antipsychotic therapy and have been reported with aripiprazole treatment including neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia and convulsions, adverse cerebrovascular events, and increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia, hyperglycaemia, and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and since post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose with aripiprazole alone has been reported to result in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without mortality.
Potentially medically significant signs and symptoms included lethargy, increased blood pressure, drowsiness, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, unintentional aripiprazole overdoses (up to 195 mg) have been reported without mortality in children.
potentially medically significant signs and symptoms have been reported, included drowsiness, temporary loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Treatment of overdose should focus on supportive measures, in order to maintain airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and symptomatic treatment.
The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.
Therefore, cardiovascular function should be instituted immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to identify possible arrhythmias.
After any present or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision is indicated until the patient recovers.
This indicates that charcoal may be an effective agent in the treatment of overdose.
Although information is not available on the efficacy of haemodialysis treatment of overdose with aripiprazole; however, haemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit in the treatment of overdose, since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics: diazepines, oxazepines and thiazepines, ATC code:
N05AX12
50 receptors and antagonistic effects on serotonin 5 HT2a receptors are mediated.
Apiprazole exhibited antagonistic properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonistic properties in dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Ariprazole was high in vitro affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor, and for serotonin 5 HT1a and 5 HT2a receptor, as well as modest affinity for dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2 and 5HT7, for alpha-1-adrenergic, and for histamine H1 receptor.
In addition, aripiprazole showed modest affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no significant affinity to muscarinic receptors.
The interaction with other receptors than the dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
When aripiprazole was administered at doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease in binding of 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the nucleus and putamen.
Other information about clinical studies:
Schizophrenia:
In three placebo-controlled short-term clinical trials (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole demonstrated a statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptoms compared with placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the outcome of the treatment in patients who have responded to the initial treatment.
In a haloperivered controlled trial, at week 52 of responder patients who contained a response to study drug containing the study drug was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall rate of patients who have completed study was significantly higher in aripiprazole (43%) than in the haloperidol group (30%).
Current values from measuring regimen defined as secondary trial objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression rate, showed a significantly greater improvement than haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled study of patients stabilised with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole demonstrated a significantly higher reduction of relapse rate, 34% in the aripiprazole group and 57% on placebo.
There was no clinically significant weight gain with aripiprazole in clinical trials.
In a 26-week, double-blind, multinational study of schizophrenia, which included 314 patients and at the primary objective of weight gain, aripiprazole (N = 18 or 13% of the evaluable patient analyses) demonstrated a at least 7% increase from baseline in weight (i. e., at least 5.6 kg, on average, of approx.
Manic episode in bipolar I disorder:
In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of flexible dose monotherapy trials over 3 weeks in patients with manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These studies included patients with or without psychotic characteristics, with or without Rapid restrictions.
In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 week duration, in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated no superior efficacy compared to placebo.
In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials of 12 week duration in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance effect similar to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
10 aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission of mania to lithium or haloperidol at Week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled study of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy, concomitant therapy with aripiprazole resulted in overt efficacy when compared to lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks duration followed by a long-term extension period of 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved stable remission on aripiprazole prior to randomization, aripiprazole was superior to placebo in terms of preventing bipolar recurrence, predominantly in the prevention of relapse.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
What Apiprazole looks like and contents of the pack Apiprazole orodispersible tablets are bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets with similar absorption rate and similar extent of absorption.
Apiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets.
Absorption:
Apiprazole is well absorbed, reaching maximum plasma concentrations within 3-5 hours after dosing.
Amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver and aripiprazole undergoes minimal presystemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
A meal with high fat content does not affect the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Apiprazole is distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are bound to plasma proteins more than 99%, mainly albumin.
Metabolism:
Dehydration, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
What ABILIFY contains The major circulating component of aripiprazole is the systemic circulation.
The bioavailability of aripiprazole is approximately 40% of the plasma AUC of aripiprazole.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-life is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole in extensive metabolisers by CYP2D6 and in approximately 146 hours for poor metabolisers with CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml / min / kg, which occurs primarily by the liver.
Approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Elderly:
Similarly, the pharmacokinetic assessment of schizophrenic patients did not show age-related effects.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between male and female healthy subjects, nor in a pharmacokinetic study in schizophrenic patients, without gender related effects.
Smoking and Race:
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no clinically significant differences in race or smoking effect of aripiprazole on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole.
Renal insufficiency:
The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydroxy aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal impairment compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic insufficiency:
A single dose study in volunteers with varying degrees of hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) has shown no significant effect on hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydroxy aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which did not undergo any significant effect on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effects were seen only at doses or exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or in humans to have limited or no relevance to clinical use.
Effects included dose-related adrenal cortical toxicity (lipofoetal pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks of treatment in rats at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose) and an increase in adrenal cortical carcinomas and combined adrenal cortical adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (60 times the mean steady-state AUC exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest exposure in female rats that did not induce tumour was 7 times higher than the human exposure.
In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a consequence of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys following repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- 81-fold the maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis.
However, the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg was not more than 6% of the concentrations of sulfate conjugate of hydroxyaripiprazole observed in the human GIST study, which were well below the threshold (6%) in vitro solubility study over 39 weeks.
Based on the results of full battery of standard battery of genotoxicity studies, aripiprazole was considered not genotoxic.
Apiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
In rabbits, these effects were observed at exposures of 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxic effects occurred in the dose range, in which the toxic effects were also seen on intrauterine development.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Apiprazole is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode of bipolar I disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose of aripiprazole is 10 or 15 mg / day for a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, with or without food.
Mechanism of action: aripiprazole is effective in the dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day.
Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated, although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode:
The recommended starting dose of ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, with or without food as monotherapy or in combination (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in bipolar I disorder:
For the prevention of recurrence of manic episodes in patients already receiving aripiprazole, therapy should be continued at the same dose.
Adjustment of daily dose, including a reduction of dosage, should be considered based on clinical status.
The orodispersible tablet should be placed on the tongue where it dissolves rapidly through the saliva.
It can be taken with or without liquid.
It is difficult to withdraw one orodispersible tablet whole from the mouth.
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening the blister.
The tablet may also be dissolved in water and the resulting suspension is drunk.
Patients who have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets may take alternatively the orodispersible tablets of ABILIFY (see section 5.2).
There is no experience in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency.
The available data are insufficient to establish dosage recommendations for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.
The dosage should be conservative in these patients.
However, the maximum dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal insufficiency.
The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in patients ≥ 65 years of age has not been demonstrated.
A lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).
No dose adjustment is necessary for women compared to men (see section 5.2).
Based on the metabolism of aripiprazole, no dosage adjustment is necessary for smoking (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors are co-administered with aripiprazole, the dose of aripiprazole should be reduced.
If the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased (see section 4.5).
If potent CYP3A4 inducers are co-administered with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
If the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored during this period.
The onset of suicidal behaviour is one of psychotic disorders and affective disorders have been reported in some cases after initiation of antipsychotic therapy, including aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close monitoring should include antipsychotic therapy in patients at high risk.
Data from one epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicidal behaviour in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aaripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular conditions, conditions which predisposed to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines) or hypertension (including accelerated and malignant).
Overdose:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was similar to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive dyskinesia: in clinical studies where one year or less dyskinesia was reported, there were uncommon reports of dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in one patient on ABILIFY, a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
If treatment is stopped, these symptoms can become worse or even arise.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):
MNS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with the use of antipsychotics.
NMS, in clinical trials, rare cases of NMS have been reported during aripiprazole treatment.
Clinical manifestations of NMS are high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevations in creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis have also been reported in some cases with NMS.
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or has unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizures: in clinical studies, seizures have been reported uncommonly during aripiprazole treatment.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or conditions associated with seizures.
Elderly patients with dementia associated with dementia:
In three placebo-controlled studies (n = 938, mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56 - 99 years) with aripiprazole in patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease were associated with an increased risk of death when compared to placebo.
The mortality rate in patients treated with aripiprazole was 3.5% compared to 1.7% for placebo.
Cerebrovascular adverse events:
In the same clinical trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e. g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) including fatalities, were observed in patients (mean age:
84 years, range:
78 - 88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of patients treated with aripiprazole reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared to 0.6% of patients treated with placebo in these trials.
The difference was not statistically significant.
However, in one of these studies, a fixed dose study, a significant relationship between dose and dose escalation was seen in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia associated with dementia.
Risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age > 65 years, dysphagia, sedation, malnutrition and dehydration, pulmonary conditions (e. g., pneumonia, with or without aspiration), or concomitant use of benzodiazepines.
65 patients with a family history of serious complications may include obesity and diabetes, a family history of diabetes.
There are no specific risk estimations for hyperglycaemic related adverse events in ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medicinal products treated patients that directly comparisons.
Patients treated with antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (e. g.
In patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness, and patients with diabetes mellitus or at risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, antipsychotics, where weight increase is known or uncommon, and could result in serious complications.
Weight gain has been reported in patients prescribed ABILIFY in post-marketing experience.
In the observed cases, patients usually have significant risk factors such as diabetes, thyroid disease or pituitary gland adenoma.
In clinical studies, aripiprazole has not resulted in clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Motility disorders of the oesophagus and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotic medicinal products including ABILIFY.
Agents such as aripiprazole and other antipsychotic medicinal products should be used with caution in patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia,
Patients with phenylketonuria:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine, which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.
As with other medicinal products, hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms that occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole may potentiate the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
Because of the primary effects of aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution should be exercised when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, such as sedation (see section 4.8).
Apiprazole should be used with caution with other medicinal products that cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of absorption of aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered to be clinically significant.
Mechanism of action: aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but not CYP1A enzymes.
Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for smoking.
In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (quinidine) increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 107%, while Cmax remained unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and by 47%.
The dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose if:
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
The absolute bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of sitagliptin is approximately 37%.
Voriconazole increased Cmax and AUCτ of rifabutin by 18% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, coadministration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers.
When used concomitantly with ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks for the patient.
If ketoconazole is co-administered with ABILIFY the dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to approximately half of the prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are expected to have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.
After discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose level consistent before initiation of concomitant therapy.
Concomitant use of ABILIFY and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 activity (e. g. diltiazem or scitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY may be expected with a modest increase in aripiprazole concentrations.
A single 125 mg dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC and Cmax of diclofenac by approximately 29% and 73%, respectively, when compared to aripiprazole alone (30 mg).
Dehydration of aripiprazole geometric mean Cmax and AUC were also increased by 69% and 69%, respectively following co-administration with carbamazepine.
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of aripiprazole was approximately 71% lower than with aripiprazole alone.
The ABILIFY dose should be doubled if ABILIFY is co-administered with carbamazepine.
It is expected that other potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, efavirenz, nevirapine and St.
After withdrawal of the high-acting CYP3A4 inducers, the dose of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were co-administered with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical trials, doses of 10 to 30 mg aripiprazole per day did not have a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
In addition, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not have any potential for an alteration in CYP1A2 in vitro.
Therefore, aripiprazole is not expected to cause clinically significant drug interactions via these enzymes.
There was no clinically significant change in valproate or lithium concentrations when aripiprazole was co-administered with valproate.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
In animal studies, potential intrauterine development disturbances were not excluded (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety data in humans and the animal reproduction studies, this medicinal product must not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Apiprazole is excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
As it is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk, patients should be advised not to breast-feed while taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to avoid hazardous machinery, including driving, until they are sure that aripiprazole has no adverse effect.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions were reported more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than with placebo or were classified as a possible medically important medically significant adverse drug reactions (*):
