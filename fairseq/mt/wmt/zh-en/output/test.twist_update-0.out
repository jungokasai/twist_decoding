The United Nations &apos; International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) 26th released a report saying that Iran has started to speed up the production of enriched uranium using advanced centrifuges , a further violation of the nuclear deal reached with world powers in 2015 .
Combining foreign media reports , the IAEA report states that advanced centrifuges “ are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium ” at Iran &apos;s Natanz nuclear facility .
Iran has been gradually violating the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers since US President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement last May and imposed sanctions on Iran .
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only process uranium using first-generation IR-1 centrifuges .
The deal &apos;s other signatories , Britain , China , France , Germany and Russia , have been trying to salvage the agreement , but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough .

Women &apos;s volleyball is expected to defend the World Cup !
On September 27 , in the match against the Netherlands , China came from behind to win the match , which the Netherlands won 3 – 1 .
The World Cup is drawing to a close , but with the title in sight , the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team will not take it easy when they face Serbia .
The Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team was consistently strong in the first two sets of the match against the Netherlands , going down in two sets in the first two sets , 25 : 19 and 25 : 16 .
The Dutch team strengthened their serve on the back of the attack , the Chinese team took a hit , and the girls were eager to attack , began to make more errors , and finally pulled one back at 21 : 25 .
After the game in an interview , Lang Ping also pointed out : &quot; The third inning , because of a mistake we sent about eight points . &quot;
Of course , Holland &apos;s strength should not be underestimated , the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team before the game also made a difficult preparations , although they lost a game , but everything is still in Lang &apos;s control . &quot; It is normal to play and win games with strong teams , it is also normal to play five games , so we said to the players to focus , &quot; Lang said .
The fourth game , the players to actively adjust the situation , Zhang opened fire at the end of the attack , scoring eight points in order to win the game .
Although the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team has touched the trophy with one hand , it did serve as a wake-up call to the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team in their match against the Netherlands : The more critical they are , the more they have to go all out .
In the other match on July 27 , Russia and the U.S. team played a full five sets , and the U.S. team failed to take all three points from its opponent , thus allowing the Chinese team to defend their title in the previous round as long as the Chinese team took all three points in the match against Serbia .
All sorts of things are moving in favor of the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team .
However , Serbia , although all of the main six teams are missing , it does not mean that they will give three points easily to the Chinese team .
In their current form , the Serbian team have largely missed out on medals , which means they can &quot; load up &quot; against the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball , putting their full burden on the Chinese team , who are likely to have their ups and downs as they come under pressure to win the title .
In addition , second-placed Serbia were not &quot; breakaway &quot; lambs , because of their depth after a strong showing in a 5 – 5 match against the Netherlands , which ended in a 3 – 2 home defeat to the Netherlands in the final 3 – 2 .
Lang Ping said before the third match : &quot; The game in Osaka is going to be tough .
Now defending the horn has sounded , the competition has really entered the &quot; white-hot phase . &quot;
On the strength of the lineup , Chinese women &apos;s volleyball is above the opponent , only the final juncture , but also to see whether the women &apos;s volleyball girls can play the normal level , on the court to liberate themselves .

&quot; For 70 years , both the deterrent and defensive measures taken by NATO have been based on maintaining technological superiority , &quot; Stoltenberg said in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point .
But times are changing , he says .
&quot; The competition we encounter is getting more and more intense , &quot; Stoltenberg said .
It is therefore time for us to redouble our efforts to be certain that no one will overtake us . &quot;
&quot; Some of the new technologies are not developed in NATO member states , they are in authoritarian states , &quot; he said .
Chinese companies are working on 5G networks .
Russia is developing an independent Internet and investing heavily in the next generation of weapons , like hypersonic missiles .
Stoltenberg said NATO &apos;s future security &quot; depends on the ability to understand , accept and apply the latest advanced technologies . &quot;
More than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Orange Star cruise to enjoy the magnificence of the Xiang River and jointly celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China .
Most of the more than 100 people with disabilities who took part in the event were on board the cruise ship for the first time .
Zhao Zhengang , 56 , is physically disabled . Due to the immobility of his feet , he rarely goes out in peacetime .
&quot; It is very exciting to go on a cruise today for the first time to see the Bojiazhuang of the Xiang River and feel the development pulse of Changsha , &quot; he said .
Volunteers from the Fukang Social Workers Service Center in Changsha City and the Blue Sky Rescue Team provide nuanced services for people with disabilities .
Especially for those with severe physical disabilities , volunteers will carry them up and down the cruise ship .
The director of the Fukang Social Workers Service Center said that , with the support of the Party and the government , the cause of persons with disabilities in Changsha has made constant progress over the past 70 years , and more and more persons with disabilities have become genuine participants , contributors and beneficiaries in social and economic development .
It is the seventieth anniversary of the Republic , the spotlights of the media , so many images that we do not always remember , and glitter — it is they who have brought the heat and light of our shining days .
However , the hero if walking around , also seems as ordinary as you like me .
China &apos;s chief scientist , a man , a whole life and a pot , has spent his life doing only one thing , nibbling cold steamed bread , just like an old man in the mountains of Guizhou province ; Zhou Ruchang , a red scientist , a late village boy who still looks like Chizi , both in China and in the West , with a dishevelled white hair , talks about learning to the heart and loves a squeal of laughter : This is a dramatic film by an artist who , after the age of ninety , is happy to act as a housemaid to a cat for the sake of bumping and jolting for six or seven hours a day in the highland .
If they , seeking benevolence , live simply , simply and insistently , they will easily become happy , oblivious of the riches and the splendor of their name , as long as they immerse themselves in the incomprehension of outsiders and the treasure of their own business .
Like Jin Yong in the novel , the Shaolin Temple Tibetan Sutra Pavilion , the sweeping monk , although the astonishment of the martial arts of the world , no pride , no happiness and no sorrow .
Every &quot; sweeping monk &quot; , every pair of kind-hearted , I have a share in the back who &apos;s home country to take responsibility .
Home national responsibility , not only carried on the hero &apos;s shoulders , but also held in the hands of millions of people .
&quot; When a hero goes by , someone has to sit by the side of the road and clap . . . I don &apos;t want to be a hero , I want to be the one to sit and clap by the side of the road . &quot;
In fact , when the hero and applaud the hero , there is no contradiction .
People who clap by the side of the road , also transmitting heat and light , are luminescent bodies themselves .
Such as you like me , in life , there is always some chance , there are some moments , there is a kind of accumulation , but also shaping the appearance of a hero .
Shanghai &apos;s excellent judge , Zou Bihua , shoulder the burden of judicial reform , but at the annual meeting , the delivery room of the old master to the stage to tell his story , a year received and sent countless newspaper letters , from no mistake , &quot; get the simple things done , it is not simple &quot; , Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to the old &quot; earth-sweeping monk &quot; .
This is the heroes sympathize with each other , it is a hero applauding another hero .
The sweeping monks have the Shaolin temple sutra pavilion , Yuan Longping has the vast experimental rice field , Nan Rendong has the heavenly eyes , Qinyi has the stage , and Zhou Ruchang has the pulpit ...
&quot; Chinese heaven &apos;s eye &quot; , for example , now seems to be a myth .
Chinese science and technology was still on an uphill climb in the 1990s , and novelist Liu Zi Xin has yet to write The Three .
The brightest &quot; eye &quot; in the world at that time was Arecibo , a single-aperture radio telescope in the Valley of Puerto Rico , 350 meters in diameter , considered to be the most &quot; invincible &quot; in the world .
The Chinese radio telescope at that time was less than one-tenth the diameter of households .
But Nan , who enjoys world-class research opportunities and salaries in Japan , insisted on going home , bringing home an almost crazy idea : building a next-generation radio telescope in China to receive more messages from outer space !
China , ah , to invest a lot of money to play for the stars ?
The motherland trusted Nan Rendong , and opened the curtain of the &quot; Heavenly Eye &quot; project .
The siting took 12 years , and the project took another nine years to complete .
With 500 meters of “ eyes in the sky ” opened , China has become , without precedent , “ a great scientific project that is unique in the world . ”
Therefore , the &quot; sky eye &quot; is marvelous , Nanren East are marvelous , there is a large , standing high of the Republic is great .
With the country &apos;s trust , the people &apos;s goodwill , Nanren Dong had the opportunity to become the spirit and courage of the people .
There is juvenile talent , white-haired hero to walk through , there are people on the roadside softly clap , such a country , very beautiful and harmonious .

Jacques Chirac &apos;s lasting political legacy
Former French President Jacques Chirac died on Sunday at the age of 86 .
In a change the world hasn ’ t seen in a century , much of the French politician ’ s political legacy still deserves our praise .
Chirac served in a charismatic manner as President of France for 12 years .
Inheritor of the independent diplomatic spirit of Gaullism , and a staunch supporter of European integration , he was a leading figure in the pursuit of the “ European dream . ”
He is also a strong advocate of world multipolarity and multilateralism , and is a strategic politician .
As a result , the French media described him as &quot; an outstanding representative of France on the world stage &quot; .
One of Mr Chirac &apos;s most celebrated political decisions was to oppose the US-led war in Iraq .
Together with Germany , France was at the forefront of the war against pressure from the United States .
A year after the war broke out , he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an increase in terrorist activity and make the world more dangerous .
Chirac &apos;s warning proved to be correct .
At a time of the collapse of European integration and the increasing salience of American unilateralism , Chirac has a strong sense of enlightenment for the strategic thinking and choice of international politics and global affairs .
Chirac was also a French politician who was familiar and kind to the Chinese .
He was one of the advocates and creators of the “ golden decade ” of Sino-French relations , which accelerated with the strategic vision of a statesman when he was first elected to the French presidency in 1995 .
In 2004 , China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership and their bilateral exchanges entered an entirely new stage .
Under Chirac , bilateral trade between China and France has grown rapidly , and the two countries have made breakthroughs in their bilateral cooperation in such fields as aviation , nuclear energy and railway transportation .
The Year of Sino-French Culture initiated by Jacques Chirac has created a completely new model of cultural exchanges in the history of China and France .
Chirac &apos;s lifelong love for Chinese culture has been particularly impressive .
Chirac can recite some of the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu , and even accurately determine the age of the Chinese bronzes , according to Chinese diplomats who know him well .
&quot; Do not look at the pyramid has not really been to Egypt , do not look at the Terra Cotta Warriors has not really been to China &quot; - this golden sentence from Chirac .
&quot; The West is concerned about China &apos;s political and social development , the ecological problems arising from China &apos;s economic growth , and China &apos;s position in international politics , &quot; Chirac once said in an interview with Xinhua .
But I personally have a lot of confidence in China .
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization and that its experience is sufficient to help it to establish its ideas and values for achieving harmonious development and to assume its long-term responsibilities on the world stage .
I also believe that China &apos;s renaissance will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich the world .
The Spin is gone , but Chirac &apos;s political legacy and message to the world will live on .

Members of the HKSAR Legislative Assembly Arguing in Opposition to the United States of America Bill
Some members of Hong Kong &apos;s legislature issued a joint statement in which they expressed their strong opposition to the passage of the &quot; Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 &quot; .
The statement , co-sponsored by 40 legislators , said that at present , Hong Kong enjoys the rights conferred by the Basic Law , including the right to maintain the status of a free port and a separate customs territory , and to conclude and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements with different countries and regions of the world in the name of &quot; Hong Kong , China &quot; in different fields such as the economy , finance , shipping , trade , communications , tourism , culture and sports .
These rights are not imposed by any foreign government or legislature .
Over the years , Hong Kong has done business with different countries and regions and taken part in many related fields of cooperation by strictly adhering to international agreements , rules , laws and business ethics .
The statement said the passage of the bill by the foreign committees of the United States House and Senate was not necessary in response to a call by its Hong Kong agents as a means of grossly interfering in Hong Kong &apos;s internal affairs and gaining political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong .
Members of the establishment deeply regretted this move by the United States and strongly opposed it .
&quot; Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the source of the largest trade surplus .
The rule of law , a fair and free business environment and a clean society make Hong Kong a good choice for businessmen in the United States .
US passage of the bill would make China-US relations worse and would not serve any interests at the expense of others , in addition to the interests of Hong Kong and the US itself .
Hong Kong will , as always , unswervingly implement the principle of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; , continue to enjoy its rights under the Basic Law and earnestly fulfill its obligations , the statement said .
Whether past , present or future , Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international commerce .
Paris , March 26 ( Xinhua ) -- Both houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week , the European Times reported on Thursday .
French President Emmanuel Macron recently stated that France could not “ accommodate everyone . ”
According to the report , Macron is trying to find a compromise on immigration in order to ease the impact of the upcoming debate .
In a recent interview during the UN General Assembly ’ s general debate in New York , Macron expressed hope for a truly “ two-pronged ” approach to migration policy that strikes a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency .
&quot; If France wants to be able to accommodate ( migrants ) properly , it cannot accommodate everyone , &quot; Macron said .
Macron outlined four pillars of migration policy : the granting of asylum as quickly as possible to refugees in need of protection ; more efficient integration of migrants ; the reception and protection of all migrants who enter French territory ; and more efficient resettlement of those who are in France illegally and unfit to stay .
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the State Medical Assistance ( AME ) system has been the subject of much debate .
Mr Macron said he wanted to “ assess ” the system , not to eliminate it , but to limit it .
Following Macron ’ s remarks , the leader of the far-right “ National Alliance , ” Marine Le Pen , tweeted that Macron ’ s announcement was “ empty talk . ”
A member of the right-wing Republican faction , Senate President Rascher , also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a way that is &quot; moderate &quot; but &quot; realistic &quot; , an indirect criticism of Macron .
Varao , a member of the leftist Socialist Party , argued that France should “ accept more and better ” when it comes to immigration , and criticized Macron ’ s &quot; manipulation &quot; of the issue .
The report points out that the new Asylum and Immigration Act , which has been in force for a year , has divided opinion within the ruling party while failing to placate the right-wing opposition party .
Macron ’ s need to do something on the subject of immigration policy will once again be a point of attack for the far right at the next general election in 2022 , but will also risk infuriating the ruling party on the left .
It has been reported that immigration policy will be debated in the lower house of the French National Assembly from September 30 and in the Senate from October 2 .
China ’ s A-shares are showing signs of a “ buy-back wave ” , with many listed companies coming up with “ real gold and silver ” to buy back shares .
According to the financial data service Oriental Wealth , as of July 27 , the total buybacks implemented in 2019 by A-listed companies had exceeded 100 billion yuan ( RMB , the same below ) , far more than in the same period of the previous year .
In response , Xu Yang , chairman of Shanghai Maikorong Information Consulting Co . , Ltd . , said that the overall valuation of the A-share market is low this year , and buying back shares at a relatively low price helps listed companies make more efficient use of capital . It also reflects listed companies &apos; willingness to actively manage market value and abundant cash flow , helping to boost investors &apos; confidence .
In addition , the continuously perfect share repurchase system , has also promoted the listed company active share repurchase .
At the beginning of this year , for example , the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules for the implementation of share buybacks by listed companies , providing detailed stock repurchase standards and guidelines for listed companies .
According to media statistics , the listed companies holding repurchase plans so far this year have been concentrated in capital construction , real estate , information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing .
In addition , in terms of repurchase payments , six listed companies have bought back more than $ 1 billion this year .
Topping the list is Yili , which has bought back more than $ 5 billion .
What impact will the repurchase of shares by a listed company have on the market ?
In an interview with reporters at the School of Finance and Finance at Renmin University of China , Vice President Zhao Xijun said that the buyback shows , on the one hand , that the listed companies have stronger economic strength and better financial position , and the ability to maintain share price stability and give investors confidence ; and on the other hand , that the listed companies and their controlling shareholders are accountable to the company , to the market and to investors .
The former is based on the company &apos;s good performance , while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have higher quality .
This is the most fundamental element of the capital market .
The stock repurchase of listed companies can boost investors &apos; confidence and support the stock price of listed companies .
It is also estimated that , based on the estimated number of share repurchases made by A-share listed companies since the beginning of this year and the average transaction price , the incremental capital for the A-share market is expected to exceed RMB 150 billion .

Wang Boxiang , Party Secretary of former Shouguang County , Shandong Province
Wang Boxiang , a native of Shouguang , Shandong , was born in February 1943 and worked in 1967 , holding the posts of township party secretary , county party secretary , and mayor .
In 1986 , Wang Boxiang served as the party secretary of Shouguang , a poor county in Weifang Province .
In the Shouguang tenure of five years , Wang Boguang in mind for the heart of the people , Wang Boxiang concentrated his efforts on doing three things : first , to advance the industrialization of vegetables ; second , to develop the Shoubei salt flats ; and third , to lay the foundation for the transformation of the industry .
As a tradition , Shouguang farmers have also learned a lesson in growing vegetables .
In the early 1980s , Shouguang farmers vegetable harvest but could not sell , rot in the ground .
Wang Boxiang research found that the key to catching vegetables is to make good circulation .
Shouguang was the first to set up a vegetable wholesale market and opened the prelude to the development of a market economy .
Party cadres to take the lead , screw up , bearing all the losses of the county .
In 1989 , Wang Leyi and 17 other party members set up 17 large shacks of Winter Vegetables with the support of Wang Boxiang , and that year 17 &quot; two hundred thousand yuan households &quot; sprang up in the village .
An extension group was set up in the county , and with the mobilization of Wang Boxiang , Wang Leyi went on a guided tour of the townships and promoted more than 5,000 vegetable houses in its first year , the momentum of which spread throughout the county and the rest of the country .
Over a period of thousands of years , 1.6 million acres of land in addition to the salt flats , is the shallow tidal flats .
The life of the local people is very hard .
Shounan has a large vegetable shed , Shoubei how to do ?
Wang Boxiang organized a battle of a hundred thousand men and camped on the beach in a battle that lasted for forty or fifty days .
Wang Boxiang and the leading cadres of the county were pushing carts at the construction site for shelter and food , just like the migrant workers and the diners , and the common people saw them all with their thumbs in their eyes and admiration in their eyes ...
In July 1986 , Wang Boxiang became a member of the Weifang Municipal Council for the first time .
During the meeting , issued a &quot; Weifang 12 district industrial economic figures comparison table &quot; , at first glance industrial output value , but also good Shouguang , ranked fourth .
However , if the raw salt is removed , Shouguang ranks third , with a net industrial output value of $ 1.19 million .
Wang Boxiang with more than 70 people to take the tour , ran to the field to &quot; change minds . &quot;
Back in less than a year , the county invested $ 150 million on 77 projects .
Since then , &quot; study tours &quot; have been organized every year in places such as Shenzhen , Dongguan , and Shanghai .
There is a lack of businesses and a lack of entrepreneurs .
Wang Boxiang chaired the panel meetings : there was an open selection of factory managers throughout the county , and 40 &quot; career-minded people &quot; were singled out and pushed to the forefront of the industry .
In 1991 , Shouguang became one of the country &apos;s 100 most powerful counties , and Wang Boxiang became the deputy mayor of the city .
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable greenhouses , 1.2 million mu of cotton fields , salt fields and ponds of shrimps , 4,854 enterprises , and more than 100,000 &quot; 10,000 yuan households &quot; , a cadre recognized by the common people .
On September 26 , Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over a meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African members of the Security Council at the United Nations Headquarters in New York .
The current members of the Security Council , including the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Côte d &apos;Ivoire , Côte d &apos;Ivoire , Equatorial Guinea , South Africa , South Africa , Niger and Tunisia , attended the meeting .
Wang Yi put forward four proposals on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the UN Security Council .
First , by going from strength to strength .
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism , the direct consequence of which is the challenge of the basic norms of international relations and the erosion of the role of the United Nations , to the detriment of the interests of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries , including African countries .
Meeting this challenge requires the strength of solidarity , with China and Africa hand in hand .
In the Security Council , where three African countries speak with one voice , the weight of focus is not just three votes but the entire continent .
If China and Africa stand together , it will not be just four votes , but will drive other countries to follow suit , influencing and shaping the Council &apos;s agenda .
Since 2018 , China has established the &quot; 3 + 1 &quot; coordination mechanism with the African members of the UN Security Council .
Second , to rely on negotiations to settle disputes .
China has always advocated political settlement of hotspot issues.Africa has a good tradition of consultation and the experience of good offices of African regional and sub-regional organizations .
There are many complex challenges on the Council &apos;s agenda , particularly the African hot spots , most of which are the scourges of colonialism and some of which are directly related to external factors .
Together , we need to make good use of Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter and give full play to the role of the United Nations in the areas of good offices and mediation .
Third , they should strengthen themselves by working independently .
African countries and peoples know its problems best , and Africa has the capacity and wisdom to solve its own problems .
In dealing with African hotspot issues by the Security Council , the will of Africa should be heeded and respected , the role of regional and subregional organizations should be brought into play , and endogenous solutions from Africa should be encouraged and supported .
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa to firmly promote African capacity building for independent peace operations .
Fourthly , development is fundamental .
As China and the African countries are both developing countries , we must persevere in giving top priority to economic and social development and support the development path chosen by each other .
China is ready to build &quot; One Belt , One Road &quot; with the AU Agenda 2063 , the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the development strategies of African countries , so as to help African countries enhance their capacity for development and eliminate the root causes of conflicts .
We must jointly urge the United Nations to increase investment in Africa &apos;s development .
In view of the new outbreak of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , China has assisted and will continue to assist with its utmost efforts , providing human and material assistance to the best of its ability.In addition , China is ready to coordinate actions with African countries and mobilize the United Nations and WHO to intensify their assistance , so as to give full play to the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .

With Trudeau &quot; falling apart , &quot; can he win a second term
This time Trudeau is stumbling out of the &quot; big hole &quot; , which Trudeau himself dug up little by little .
Recently , the Canadian media published a series of old photos of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau portraying himself as black .
This was seen as a clear act of racial discrimination and immediately caused a stir in Canada .
After it happened , Trudeau repeatedly issued a public apology .
Canadians don &apos;t buy much , however .
Trudeau lifted a rock and shot himself in the foot .
As political critic Riley and others point out , since the “ anti-blackface movement ” emerged from the United States , Trudeau and the federal Liberal Party have vociferously accused members of the opposition or dissent within his own party of being “ at fault ” in this , claiming on several occasions that “ whoever makes such a mistake should be fired immediately . ”
Simply put , this time he pulled Trudeau out of the &quot; sinkhole &quot; , which he dug up little by little .
Trudeau , the young , handsome son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau , started out with a whirlwind of &quot; political icons . &quot;
He took over as head of the federal Liberal Party and won a surprise victory in the 2015 Canadian federal election , in which the Liberal Party won more than half of the seats in the House of Commons .
At that time , Trudeau proposed a number of bold platforms and ideas , such as “ ethnic and gender equality , ” “ eco-environmental protection , ” “ economic revitalization , ” and an emphasis on ending corruption and “ malpractices . ”
However , he has gone &quot; up and down &quot; in almost all of these areas during his five years in office .
As for the issue of ethnic and gender equality , leave aside this &quot; blackface &quot; issue , following his &quot; underhanded rhetoric &quot; on a number of aboriginal issues that caused aboriginal groups and leaders to move their protest tents to the gates of Capitol Hill on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Canada ’ s founding .
In the fight against corruption , at the end of last year , Trudeau became embroiled in the “ Lanwang incident ” earlier this year .
He was exposed as a major case of favoritism fraud against the construction company &quot; Lan Wanling &quot; in his hometown , and put pressure on the responsible departments and officials .
To make matters worse , Trudeau became angry with the disclosure officials – the first disclosure was made by a man named Wangzhoudi , who was then the Attorney General of Canada .
Although there is doubt in the case itself , the suspicion is difficult to whitewash .
Many observers have argued that the collapse of Trudeau ’ s five years in power was largely due to his own “ planer pit , ” the largest being a “ tiger ’ s tail ” to “ reap the consequences ” and “ a magnanimous , strict man . ”
Canada ’ s most authoritative Angus-Reid poll shows that , from 2015 to date , support for Trudeau has slipped from more than 60 % to more than 30 % , while opponents have soared from less than 30 % to more than 30 % .
The federal prime minister , head of the ruling party , is now shunned by a significant proportion of voters who still prefer to vote for the federal Liberal Party , even though other opposition parties and their party leaders have not fared equally well .
As Canada ’ s federal legislative election begins on October 21 , can Trudeau repeat his resounding victory five years ago ?
The answer may lie in one word : hard .
Whether from the aspects of corporate competition , consumer experience , regional aviation integration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration , it has a far-reaching and positive significance .
On September 25 , Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened .
The New Beijing News was informed by the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the Capital Airport was in an oversaturated state of operation and that the opening of Daxing International Airport would increase the capacity of air services in the capital .
After Shanghai , Beijing became the second city in China to have two airports , which mainly serve domestic air services , similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and Pudong Airport . In the future , both the Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will be differently positioned to serve different domestic and international air services .
Daxing air traffic , from the business development perspective , the Capital Airport is more of a positive impact .
Capital Airport is the busiest airport in the country with a throughput of over 100 million passengers in 2018 , but there is still a significant shortfall in capacity relative to the rapidly growing business demand , especially on international routes .
In order to better serve the needs of passenger travel and travel both at home and abroad , and in keeping with Beijing &apos;s increasingly open and international trend of urban development , Daxing International Airport will maintain its position as a major international airport with an annual capacity of 100 million passengers and 4 million tons of post and cargo .
Therefore , the two airport positioning do not overlap , for different customer groups , also have sufficient market space .
From an economic point of view , the opening of Daxing international airport will obviously have a win-win effect , ease tensions in Beijing , accelerate the growth of passenger and cargo throughput , and create an incremental cake for the capital &apos;s air operations .
, increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , increasing the number of passengers at the airport , and increasing the number of passengers at the airport .
Depending on the distance between 20 km and 30 km , fares are set at RMB 10 , RMB 25 and RMB 35 . In order to travel through the city of Kaohsiung City , people will be able to travel from Beijing West Railway Station to Daxing Airport in less than 20 minutes .
In general , there are many available means of transport to Tai Hing Airport and the cost and time are within a reasonable range .
Daxing Airport is a transportation hub , so it is far away from Beijing , but it intensifies the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin , and it is convenient for more people to travel to Hebei and Tianjin , which is of great significance for the economic development of the city .
In the future , passengers from Hebei and Tianjin can enjoy more international air line services provided by Daxing International Airport , as can be seen from the transportation planning of the airport .
In addition to the new airport line from downtown Beijing to the Daxing Airport , there are several highways connecting the Daxing Airport and the surrounding area .
Such as Guangdong Dongguan , Foshan , Qingyuan , and other city passengers can travel via Guang Buddha , Guang Shen and other highways to the Guangzhou Baiyun airport , the residents of Langfang , Xiong &apos;an New Area and other areas around Beijing will benefit from the Daxing airport and gain access to convenient and efficient air services .
It can be seen that the navigability of Daxing International Airport , not only the addition of a few runways and a few aircraft , whether from the level of enterprise competition , consumer experience , regional aviation integration and the development integration of the area , have a far-reaching and positive impact on the long-term layout and development of Beijing &apos;s shipping industry , provide a diversified choice for the residents of the area , further improve the quality of shipping services , further promote the integrated development of the area , and promote the trade and economic development of the area around Daxing Airport .
Therefore , for the navigation of Daxing airport , our economy is not only an individual of the small account , but also a big account of the overall development .

Forum on economic and social issues to be held in Vietnam in 2019
The Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam , Nguyen Duc Ken , revealed that at the beginning of this year , Viet Nam &apos;s economic and social development showed a lot of new progress and continue to maintain the trend of growth .
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019 , and proposed measures for economic and social development at the end of 2019 and 2020 .
At the Forum , participants had an in-depth exchange of views and views on four themes : economic developments in 2019 and the impact of some FTAs ; some salient issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019 ; salient issues in the society and culture of Viet Nam in 2019 ; and projections and proposals for the economic and social development of Viet Nam in 2020 .
There is broad agreement that the first few months of 2019 have seen a slowdown in global economic growth , with increased risks and challenges .
Trade frictions among major economies further shrink global trade and investment .
The International Monetary Fund concluded that despite global economic uncertainty , with 70 % of the world economy experiencing stagnant growth , the Vietnamese economy has made a lot of good progress , with the macro economy running smoothly and inflation effectively under control , with the consumer price index rising by an average of 2.64 % in the first half of 2019 , the lowest increase in nearly three years .
GDP growth in the first half of 2019 was 6.76 % , down from 7.05 % in the same period last year , but still high compared to the same period in the 2011-2017 period .
In making a forecast for the development of the Vietnamese economy in 2019-2020 , Deng Deying , deputy director of the National Center for Economic and Social Prediction of Viet Nam , said that the Vietnamese economy in 2019 shows a high growth momentum against the backdrop of the turbulence of the world economy .
It is expected that by 2020 , Viet Nam &apos;s macro economy will remain basically stable , the implementation of various free trade agreements will give impetus to trade development , economic restructuring and improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened , and Viet Nam &apos;s external export activities will decline due to trade frictions .
It is therefore necessary to strengthen monitoring and early warning mechanisms and proactively seek trade relief measures for Viet Nam &apos;s exports , as well as opportunities to develop new export markets so as to facilitate the external export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products .
At the same time , to keep the rate of inflation at a reasonable level in order to promote the development of ancillary industries and support the development of high-tech , organic and ecological agriculture .

Witness a decade of &quot; cloud rise &quot; in digital China . - Xinhua.com
A full decade has passed since the 2019 Cyber Congress was held in Hangzhou , taking the 2009 Local Web Forum as the starting point .
From a concept “ in the cloud ” to practice “ in the cloud ” , within a decade , big data and cloud computing has become one of the core technologies that underpin China ’ s economic development , social management , and public services .
In Haining , Zhejiang province &apos;s Zhengtai new energy photovoltaic workshop , quality inspectors recently flanked by a number of new &quot; colleagues &quot; loaded with Ariyun &apos;s artificial intelligence .
It lasts 24 hours , the identification speed is more than twice the speed of man , and the quality inspection accuracy rate is stable at more than 95 % .
The quality inspector with the camera has focused on more than 40,000 defective samples , harnessing the power of cloud calculation that allowed it to quickly convert infrared images into binary language and categorize and place defective batteries , company officials said .
The company is just a microcosm of the transformation of today &apos;s cloud computing power manufacturing .
There has been a period of rapid economic and economic growth in the period from 2017 to 2017 , and the Australian Government has stated that , by the end of 2018 , there is expected to be a period of rapid economic growth and rapid economic growth for the period up to 2020 , a period of rapid economic growth and growth .
Ali Cloud founder Wang Jian says that today , data-centric cloud computing has built bridges and opened the way to a digital economy in which data is a key factor .
Meanwhile , China &apos;s cloud computing industry has been expanding over the past 10 years .
The white paper on cloud computing development ( 2019 ) released in July this year by the China Academy of Information and Communication Technology showed that the overall market for cloud computing in China reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018 , an increase of 39.2 % from 2017 .
In addition to being the key technology underpinning industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy , the inaccessible “ cloud ” has unwittingly transformed urban management and social life .
This year at the conference , the third consecutive appearance of the &quot; city brain &quot; continues to attract attention .
Ali Yun said that the current urban brain from a traffic governance tool has become an urban management center , related cooperative application has been extended to 23 cities around the world .
Through camera perception , artificial intelligence algorithms , and strong computing power , the urban brain enables new urban management service functions such as &quot; Stop Before You Pay , &quot; &quot; Visitor Real-Time Perception &quot; and &quot; Travel Route Design . &quot;
In the area of government services , docking with &quot; a cloud &quot; to &quot; a thing &quot; , &quot; business in the palm of the hand &quot; to work together to push forward , cloud computing is convenient for both ends of the supply of government services .
At present , Zhejiang through the government cloud , has constructed the entire province unified public data platform .
As of September 11 , the platform has covered more than 57 million resident population of the province and more than 15 million corporate units , gathered to govern the 3066 class of 190.8 million pieces of data .
Government departments in Zhejiang call and share an average of 12 million data calls per month , and each more flow of data calls on the cloud may mean that people do fewer errands .
Prudently use the plastic tea bag to make the tea !
A packet of plastic tea bags could emit billions , if not billions , of plastic particles , significantly higher than the amount of microplastics a person is estimated to consume in a year , but there is no evidence yet that such particles pose a threat to humans , a new Canadian study has found .
Immersing a plastic tea bag into a cup of almost boiling water ( 95 degrees Celsius ) releases an estimated 11.6 billion plastic particulates and 3.1 billion smaller nano-plastic particulates into the cup , researchers at Magill University in Canada reported .
This number is significantly higher than the number of microplastics a person is estimated to consume over an entire year .
According to an earlier study published in 2019 , the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year , while inhaling the same amount of microplastics .
The study , published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology , tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal shops and cafes by ripping them open , washing them , immersing them in almost boiling water for five minutes and analysing them with an electron microscope and spectrometer .
They found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles , &quot; several levels higher than the previous plastic load of other foods , &quot; according to the study .
Most of the bags are made from natural fibres , but many are still sealed with plastic , the report said .
Some branded tea bags have switched from paper to plastic , which the researchers tested .
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic , which the researchers define as range in size between 100nm and 5mm , and are produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste .
Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air , soil , rivers and the deepest trenches around the world , as well as in tap water , bottled water , seafood and beer .
Researchers first detected plastic particles in human stool samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018 .
To test the potential toxicity of the tea bag releasing plastic pellets , the Canadian research team placed water fleas into already contaminated water and found that the microplastics could affect the behavior of the water fleas and cause developmental deformities .
To date , there is no evidence that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans , according to the World Health Organization .
However , more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and how it affects humans , the WHO noted .
The researchers speculate that the reason these tea bags emit large amounts of plastic particles may be that the bags come in contact with boiling water and can break down or ooze toxic even when the &quot; edible grade &quot; plastic is heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius .
Mr Guterres said the climate emergency was the biggest threat to the survival of the small island nation .
There , a natural disaster can erode the development gains of a generation .
This has been illustrated by the hurricanes this year of Barbuda , Dominica and the Bahamas .
Approximately one quarter of the population of small island developing States live 5 metres or less above sea level .
Relocation could seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity .
By working together to achieve carbon and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030 at the Climate Action Summit on Monday , they are once again leading the world in the right direction .
&quot; The climate crisis is piling up new injustices on top of the old ones , &quot; Guterres said .
Although small island developing States have contributed little to global warming , they have paid the highest price .
Because of their middle-income status , many are also trapped in an accelerating and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt .
The world must act , and now is the time to make big decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States , &quot; he said .
Today &apos;s High-level Meeting adopted a political declaration that called for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks , invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and make the transition to renewable energy ; and urged international agencies to help small island developing States , particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries , gain access to financing .
Small island developing States are at the forefront of the protection and conservation of the Earth &apos;s lifeline , the ocean .
The latest special report , released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , confirms that the oceans have already suffered the dire consequences of the climate crisis .
By mid-century , many regions are likely to experience some extreme sea-level rise each year that would have happened only once in a century .
The report warns that without a significant investment in adaptation , some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable .
There are huge losses from pollution , overfishing and acidification .
Over the past 150 years , the world has lost half of all living coral , while over the past 40 years , plastic pollution has increased tenfold .
Demand for industry , shipping , mining and tourism is leading to the depletion of resources , including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities .
Small island States also face high costs of transport , energy and infrastructure .
They are heavily dependent on a number of external markets , exposing them to price fluctuations .
Some States are also making efforts to address the security impact of illicit trafficking in persons , arms and drugs .
&quot; By solving a problem in the most challenging environment , it can be solved anywhere , &quot; Guterres said .
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools , lessons learned and examples that can be drawn from around the world . &quot;
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development .
They need the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community .
India &apos;s finance ministry says the financial system is highly liquid .
Indian Finance Minister Sitharaman 26 said the current illiquid financial system , driven by festive consumer demand , India &apos;s economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of the current fiscal year .
Sitaraman made the remarks after a meeting with representatives of Indian private banks , non-bank financial institutions , housing banks and other institutions .
Seetharaman did not specify the specific nature of the remarks .
Previously , some Indian and overseas media blamed India &apos;s ongoing economic slowdown on the liquidity constraints of non-bank financial institutions .
Citing the decline in car sales as an example , Sitaraman denied that the liquidity crunch was the main reason for the drop in sales .
Mr Sitharaman pointed out that the fall in car sales was mainly driven by cyclical factors .
Mr. Sitharaman predicts that India &apos;s economic growth is likely to resume in the second half of the fiscal year , driven by holiday consumption .
India &apos;s annual shopping season starts in September and will run until the end of the year .
Spending on shopping is expected to contribute significantly to India &apos;s economic growth .

26 local time , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe released a video to congratulate the People &apos;s Republic of China on its 70th anniversary .
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe : Good evening , I am Shinzo Abe .
On behalf of the Japanese Government and people , I would like to express our warm congratulations on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People &apos;s Republic of China .
At the G20 Summit in Osaka in June , Japan and China cooperated for the success of the Summit and demonstrated the firm will of the G-20 to the world by adopting the Declaration of the G20 Osaka Summit .
Moreover , at the Japan-China summit and dinner prior to the summit , it was agreed that President Xi Jinping would pay a state visit to Japan next spring , with a shared determination to usher in a new era .
Together , Japan and China bear great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world .
I firmly believe that the joint efforts of the two countries in addressing issues facing the region and the world and making joint contributions to the international community will be conducive to the construction of a new model of future relations between the two countries .
In conclusion , I hope China-Japan relations flourish and I wish our friends every prosperity and prosperity .
&quot; They are estimated to account for more than half of the overage migrant workers on some construction sites .
Where can I find the young workers now ?
It didn &apos;t help that the construction site didn &apos;t want to use so many &apos; old people &apos; . &quot;
Recently , on the site of a number of migrant workers ( beyond the retirement age ) the phenomenon , long years in the construction industry to do the construction contractor Zou Kui lament .
Recently , the author in the university rain pollution diversion project , the campus appeared a number of migrant workers , if you observe carefully , it will find that there are a number of overage migrant workers .
Overage migrant migrant workers are not “ idle ” , but because “ not idle ” , the helplessness and hardship of “ have to be so ” – whether to save money to solve their pension and medical problems , or to help their children , drives these old people who should be “ idle ” to continue to toil .
The &quot; old age &quot; of overage migrant workers is not as easy as we thought .
They bring up their children , support the elderly , provide schooling for their children , help them build buildings , buy cars , help them start a family and raise their grandchildren . When these migrant workers have accomplished their &quot; life tasks &quot; , the money bags have been emptied and even have a lot of debt , and most of them lack the accumulation of wealth .
In order not to drag the children and in order for themselves to accumulate more wealth , many migrant workers adhere to &quot; dry till dry &quot; .
Many &quot; after 80 &quot; , &quot; after 90 &quot; or even &quot; after 00 &quot; of the new generation of rural migrant workers do not want to work in arduous , highly labor-intensive secondary industries or low-end service industries , resulting in a structural &quot; labour shortage , &quot; and these unattractive jobs provide opportunities for over-aged migrant workers .
Due to their lack of technical skills and the decline of their physical functions and labor ability , many over-aged migrant migrant workers find themselves in jobs with high intensity , low incomes , high risks and little security .
A day is a day to be able to earn a little more , and the existential predicament of the overaged migrant workers behind &quot; no leisure &quot; cannot be ignored and ignored .
It is also necessary to solve the difficult problem of underpaying and collecting wages , improve labor protection , reduce safety risks , increase labor income , and improve the living conditions of overage migrant workers , who can save not only for themselves , but also the institutional care and humane care of the public sector .
Some scholars have pointed out that overage migrant workers are less likely to return home to cultivate land to solve their pension and medical problems , they have to support their families by other means .
Understanding the helplessness and strength of the over-aged migrant workers &quot; cannot be idle &quot; helps us to better understand the love and pain of overaged migrant workers .
Seeing the backs of over-aged migrant workers , hearing their sighs , and finding ways to make them truly “ grow old ” on their return to their villages requires a sharing of responsibility in a healthy interaction between the public sector , the market and society .
Mr. Chemezov said Russia would not export such systems in the next five years because “ domestic troops will be supplied first and export production will follow thereafter ” .
This practice is fully in line with international practice .
Major producers of arms and military equipment always ensure their own defence requirements before processing export orders .
Earlier , the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces , General Yuri Glekhov , said the development of the system was nearing completion .
The S-500 was developed by Diamond-Antai Aerospace Defence .
This is a new generation of air defence systems , based on the working principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets .
The primary role of the S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles with a range of up to 3,500 km .
In addition , according to some information , the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft , almost all types of unmanned aircraft , hypersonic missiles exceeding five times the speed of sound , and even near-space targets .
Such a weapon could also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems , in particular the S-400 , which is important from a defence perspective .
Sergei Chomezov expressed particular concern about the S-400 .
The system is currently in high demand in the world , but Russian forces also need it , including in the Arctic , he said .
The S-400 air defence system was assigned to the Arctic Air Defence Regiment .
According to the information of 15 September , the conversion by the Novaya Zemlya Polar air defence regiment of the S-400 air defence missile system has been completed .
This is not Russian militarization in the Arctic .
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence , this is entirely a process within the plan for the transition to more advanced defence tools in the strategic direction for the north .
&quot; The controllable airspace in the Arctic has increased markedly with the transition to the new S-400 air defense system , &quot; the Russian Northern Fleet news service said .
Significantly , the military has assessed that the use of the system has been successful in the Far North and Arctic regions .
The officers and men of the air defence regiment were trained on the new system and were ready for combat duty .
It was previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system , part of which is still in use today .
That said , air defense systems must have weapons that can destroy a variety of aerial targets , whether high-speed targets at outer altitudes , or &quot; leak nets &quot; close to protected facilities .
According to open sources , the S-400 Triumph system is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft , ballistic missiles , hypersonic targets , and other aerial attack weapons .
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets at a range of 400 km and shoot down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 km per second at a range of 60 km .
Russia has made no secret of the fact that it will deploy additional air defences in the far north to secure the airspace of the northern sea lanes .
Not long ago , the first batch of 12 Tor M2DT air defense missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic , enough to form an air defense battalion to strengthen Arctic air defense .
The Russian Defense Ministry said at the time that the Arctic &quot; Thor &quot; forces would expand to full brigade strength in the future .
Together with the S-400 long-range system newly deployed to Novaya Zemlya and the Kola Peninsula , and the Pantsir-SA short-range system deployed in the Far North region , these advanced anti-aircraft weapons make a significant contribution to the defence of Russia &apos;s polar skies .
It will be very difficult for enemy aircraft , helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defence .
According to the Russian government , the flagship store would serve as a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods , avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores .
The company , a Russian store operator , focuses on selling Russian goods in China .
The company has an online presence on some of China &apos;s largest trading platforms such as Tmall , JD , 1688 , Pindoduo , ShouQ , and WeChat .
The Russian Export Center will work with Aurobindo to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards , and screen companies that store their products on virtual shelves .
The store plans to open and stock products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers by the end of this year .
According to the Russian Export Center , China &apos;s electronic commerce platform receives a total of 1 billion visits per month .
Meanwhile , food exports to China have shown steady growth since 2014 , surpassing $ 1 billion in 2018 .
Alibaba Group will now also open pilot stores to sell goods from New Zealand , Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy .
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov , the new store will display goods from businesses with sales of at least 500 million roubles .
To be honest , my expectations are higher , and the sale of 500 million roubles is still insignificant .
We all know that Chinese consumers have a positive attitude towards Russian goods and regard them as high quality and green products .
Mr. Kozhevnikov says competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and increasing .
&quot; We have an ambitious target to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years , &quot; he said .
At the same time , the platform will also store the products of Russian Far Eastern companies .
&quot; This is a political project that represents the image of both sides , because the Russian export center is a state-owned and not a private institution , &quot; said Vyacheslav Ceglov , a professor at the Basic Institute of Trade Policy at Russia &apos;s Plekhanov University of Economics .
&quot; I don &apos;t see a lot of very competitive Russian goods on the market . &quot;
He believed that the project would probably not actually be implemented , but would contribute to strengthening relations between the two countries .
The president of the Russian Export Center , Andrey Slepnev , said during the Oriental Economic Forum that information on the products of more than 170 Russian companies has been distributed on the largest international wholesale online platform , Alibaba.com , and can be purchased both in China and in other countries , RIA Novosti reported .
There is also a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group , a training program for Russian enterprises by experts from Taobao University , whose first seminar was held in July this year .
The Russian Export Center will also serve as an organizer for Russian enterprises to participate in industry exhibitions and commercial projects at the Second China International Import Exposition in Shanghai in November this year .
A major exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square-meter hall , which will also serve as a center for commercial project events , deal-signing ceremonies , presentations and talks with representatives of Chinese businesses .
About 50 applications from Russian agribusiness have been received so far .
&quot; Besides the agricultural booth , we will definitely hold business meetings to arrange direct links between entrepreneurs , &quot; said the Russian Export Center News Service .
&quot; This is another direction in our efforts to support businesses and ensure that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them . &quot;
Masterclasses , culinary competitions and tasting sessions of Russian dishes cooked by renowned Russian chefs for the project &quot; Exploring the Shanghai Station of Russian gastronomy , &quot; will also be held at the fair .
After the Mohd al-Ahmadi Coroner &apos;s Court on Friday handed down a verdict of non-accidental death , the police took the next step as they waited for a full report and instructions from the Attorney General &apos;s Office .
Following the court &apos;s ruling , the police will await further instructions from the Attorney General &apos;s Office , the National Police Criminal Investigation Department said in a statement Friday .
In his statement , he stressed that police have never terminated the investigation into Muhammad &apos;s death , which is still ongoing .
Snow state police chief Emil Voronezh , on the other hand , said the police would wait for a full report on the content of the ruling before taking action .
He was responding to an inquiry from the deputy chief after attending the handover ceremony at the New York State Police headquarters on Friday morning .
He said police were investigating the case in light of the reports .
He added that the police will also keep an eye on the investigation and decide whether to re-call the person who made an earlier statement .

Xinhua Time Review : Firmly Walk Our Own Way
The fundamental reason for the success of China &apos;s development over the past 70 years is that , under the leadership of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , the Chinese people have found and unswervingly followed the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics .
For China to follow its own path of development is a historical choice and the people &apos;s choice .
Since modern times , in the environment of weal and woe , the benevolent spirits of the people from generation to generation went onward and onward in their quest to find the way to save the country and save the people .
However , “ the constitutional monarchy , the monarchy , the parliamentary system , the multi-party system , the presidential system were all thought and tried , and it didn ’ t work . ”
Only with the Communist Party of China and New China did the Chinese people gradually carve out a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice .
The road that China walks out is the road to the happiness of the Chinese people , the road to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the road to common development between China and the rest of the world .
It is by being on the right path that China will be able to do its work well , become the world &apos;s second largest economy and the largest contributor to global economic growth , and continue to benefit the world with its own development .
As the white paper points out , China &apos;s development path , which is in line with China &apos;s national conditions and adapted to the requirements of the times , will increasingly show bright development prospects as the era progresses .
Looking back , the Chinese people know full well how hard it is to find a right path , and when looking around the world , the Chinese people cherish it even more .
The Chinese understand the principles of northern briers and understand that what is best for others is not necessarily what is best for themselves , but what is best for them .
It is with this kind of road self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created the miracle that attracts worldwide attention .
In the human advance of the tortuous process , the &quot; final conclusion of history &quot; has been known for a long time .
Today , the success of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics declares the end of the &quot; final conclusion of history &quot; , the collapse of the &quot; Chinese collapse theory &quot; , and the failure of &quot; socialist defeatism &quot; .
China &apos;s success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in the wealth and strength of their people , expanded their path to modernization , and provided useful lessons for those countries and ethnic groups in the world that wish to speed up their development and maintain their independence in taking the road suitable to their own national conditions .
The world is colorful .
China has always respected the right of each country to choose a development path suitable to its national conditions .
Rather than &quot; importing &quot; the foreign model or &quot; exporting &quot; the China model , China will unswervingly follow its own path , realize its own constant development , strengthen exchanges of governance with other countries , and make due contributions to the joint realization of good governance .
It comes after the Fair Work Commission found that a Foodworks supermarket boss who sacked a 66-year-old female worker via text message for preferring to employ staff from Asian backgrounds has been slammed as &quot; disgraceful . &quot;
The council said the way staff were treated by Miss Gail owner Eddie Wang , who has worked at the Wagga Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years , was &quot; grossly unfair &quot; and may have breached anti-discrimination laws .
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr Wang , who took over the store in 2016 , had always &quot; wanted to fire me &quot; because she was not Chinese .
In this case , the commission &apos;s vice-chairman , Peter Sams , conducted an internet search and found &quot; a number of job ads posted by Mr Wang on various Australian Chinese employment forums in the past . &quot;
Of the requirements listed for the jobs , one said &quot; preferred Asian lady &quot; and another said &quot; preferred Asian employee . &quot;
A third post said he would &quot; prefer people overseas ( sic ) . &quot;
Mr Wang fired Ms Ayton via text message in April , later claiming it was due to her absence and the alleged loss of small amounts of cash ranging from $ 5.10 to $ 30 at the cash register .
But Mr Sams said Mr Wang &apos;s case for dismissing Ms Ayton was weak and lacked evidence .
She had only missed one shift in three years , and the &quot; missing &quot; amounted to a few Australian dollars .
He said Ms Ayton &apos;s dismissal had &quot; virtually nothing to do with her behaviour or performance . &quot;
&quot; It seems to me that the respondent &apos;s real motivation for firing her , supported by the evidence of the job advertisement released by Mr. Wang , was that he preferred to hire an employee with an Asian background , &quot; he said .
Mr Wang &apos;s conduct that ostensibly constitutes a breach of anti-discrimination law and / or the dismissal of an applicant is unlawful under section 772 ( f ) of the Fair Work Act .
Mr Sams said it would be inappropriate for him to consider resuming her post in light of Mr Wang &apos;s &quot; appalling &quot; treatment of Ms Ayton .
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton , who is a casual worker on a salary of A $ 26 an hour .
In light of potential breaches of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation , Mr Sams said he would refer his findings and documents to committee chiefs to consider whether Mr Wang &apos;s conduct should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible breaches of state or federal law .
He said Mr Wang had not given Ms Ayton any chance to respond to the alleged reasons for sacking her .
&quot; I believe that the Respondent has resorted to an irredeemably unfair and biased process to dismiss the applicant and Mr Wang is &apos; waiting &apos; for this opportunity , which he believes will &apos; justify &apos; the termination of the applicant &apos;s employment , &quot; he said .
&quot; He was wrong ... the respondent &apos;s complete disregard for any natural and just treatment given to her in the dismissal of the applicant and , shockingly , his grossly unfair and perfunctory behaviour . &quot;
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks was a small business , &quot; it is important to say frankly that any decent employer will not fire its employees in the extremely unfair and perfunctory way that has been acknowledged in this case . &quot;
&quot; It is shameful and it is extremely unfair , &quot; he said .

The original lawyer representing the Chinese defendant , Li Zhenhua , who was also a National Assembly member of the Sunset sinkhole , applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial , meaning that he would no longer be the defendant &apos;s lawyer , which was approved by the court .
He stated that he had drawn criticism from his political opponents for acting on behalf of the accused , and that the DAP to which he belongs was also implicated .
He stressed that he did not fear any threat , but did not wish to be used by irresponsible units to slander DAP and the League Government or other League leaders , and that such a decision had been taken only after careful consideration .
He also said there was no conflict of interest between representing the defendant and being a member of Parliament , that the law did not prohibit him from representing any of the defendants and that Mr Lai , the defendant , had not yet been convicted .

I think Vietnam is on the right path and is doing very well .
It is important for Vietnam to know how to use the opportunities offered by the Fourth Industrial Revolution for greater economic development .
Artificial intelligence is completely transforming the way people work , communicate and live .
It brings greater efficiency , but it also creates threats that exacerbate social , economic and technological inequalities .
However , only any city in the world is ready for breakthroughs in the age of artificial intelligence , according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman .

New Year buybacks by listed companies worth more than $ 100 billion hits new record high - Xinhuanet.com
In order to stabilize the company &apos;s stock price and preserve the company &apos;s image , listed companies began to repurchase their shares frequently in the last two years through targeted buybacks , competitive bidding , etc . , in order to pass on the underestimation of the company &apos;s value to the market in order to stabilize the stock price and increase investor confidence .
Data show that $ 7.9 billion was used by listed companies to buy back shares in 2017 , which jumped to $ 51 billion in 2018 , and since 2019 the total amount of buybacks implemented by A-share listed companies has exceeded $ 100 billion , an all-time high for the repurchase of A-shares and far higher than in the previous year .
In view of the repurchase , the purpose of the repurchase seems to be the same as the increase in the holding of major shareholders , but there are great differences in such aspects as the main body of the implementation , the source of funds , the use of the repurchase , and the equity of the stock itself .
Xu Yang , chairman of Shanghai Maikorong Information Consulting Company , said in an interview with the Securities Daily that the Opinions on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares , issued in November 2018 , addressed some of the problems in the current system , such as a narrow share repurchase process , a complicated decision-making process , and an inadequate inventory system .
In January , the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges formally issued the Rules of Implementation for the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Corporations.These policies have broadened listed companies &apos; repurchase funds , appropriately streamlined implementation procedures , provided guidance to perfect governance arrangements , and encouraged all types of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee shareholding plans .
After the opinion issued , the listed companies to carry out the share repurchase operation , with more suitable circumstances , the repurchase process more simple , share repurchase more enthusiasm .
Repurchase of shares in relatively low locations is also beneficial for listed companies to make more efficient use of funds , thereby increasing earnings per share , improving return on equity , and relieving pressure on corporate earnings targets .
The repurchase of shares of listed companies is more significant than that of large shareholders , and it also reflects the willingness of active market value management and abundant cash flow .
Xu Yang believes that an undervalued stock price is a major factor in the buyback of a listed company , and the company &apos;s stock price cannot reflect the company &apos;s prospects for the future .
There is a large-scale repurchase of listed companies , at least an indication of the company &apos;s development confidence and capital strength .
Growing enthusiasm for repurchases by A-share listed companies has also normalized the repurchase behavior , with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share repurchase this year , and leading companies in various industries have become the mainstay of the repurchase market .
In its recent report on the progress of the repurchase , Ping An reported that through a centralized bidding transaction , the company has cumulatively repurchased 57.59 million shares of A shares , or 0.315 % of the company &apos;s total capital stock , with total paid funds totaling 5 billion yuan ( excluding transaction fees ) , and that all of the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock ownership plans , including but not limited to long service plans approved by the general meeting of shareholders .
Yili has paid 5.792 billion yuan for the share repurchase , and in a recent adjustment for the purpose of the repurchase , the original plan that &quot; all of the repurchased shares will be used as a source of shares for later implementation of equity incentives &quot; was changed to the &quot; cumulative repurchase of 183 million shares , of which 152 million shares are for the implementation of equity incentives , and the remaining 30.49 million shares are for cancellation to reduce registered capital &quot; .
Yili shares said that the cancellation of some of the repurchased shares helped to further enhance the level of earnings per share and effectively increase the return on investment of the company &apos;s shareholders .
On September 25 , it was announced that TCL had repurchased 3.59 % of the company &apos;s shares at a total cost of $ 1.65 billion .
TCL &apos;s board office told the Securities Journal that the repurchase shares will be used for employee stock ownership plans , equity incentives or to convert corporate bonds issued by listed companies that are convertible into shares .
TCL adhered to its established management strategy and continued to improve its competitiveness and healthy development .
Based on confidence in the company &apos;s future development and the preservation of investors &apos; interests , combined with the company &apos;s secondary market performance for nearly a year , and comprehensive consideration of the company &apos;s operating and financial situation , etc . , the company plans to repurchase shares of the company using its own funds , self-financing and other means of financing .
Yang Delung , chief economist of the Qianhai Open Source Fund , said that stock buybacks by listed companies can reduce the number of shares circulating in the market and increase their earnings per share , which is an important positive for stock prices in the secondary market , and the willingness of listed companies to pay out real gold and silver and buy back their shares from the stock market .
While buybacks by domestic listed companies have gradually increased in recent years , particularly blue chip stocks , boosting investor confidence through share buybacks is a very good approach and an approach that deserves recognition and encouragement .
The Hunan Provincial Standing Committee and Secretary of the Changsha Municipal Committee , Hu Henghua and the four leaders of the Xiang Army , Zhan Chunxin , Liang stable root , He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang , set the small goal of building a world-leading industrial cluster of engineering machinery after thirty-five years .
In Changsha to create the world &apos;s leading construction machinery industry cluster , in modern words , is to create the &quot; surface strongest &quot; .
As an inland provincial capital , Changsha cried out this rhetoric , how to come ?
By the domineering side leakage of strength .
The four construction machines taking part in the dialogue took matters into their own hands , covering all areas of the sky , underground , sea and land : the mountain and river intelligent light airplanes , the concrete pumps , the heavy-work all-ground cranes and the iron construction tunnel shield machine , whose hard power is regarded as one of the best in the world .
Once upon a time , China had little say in the manufacturing of construction machinery .
Easy to move around the world , Chinese enterprises &quot; brought in &quot; to &quot; go out &quot; two-wheel drive , take the &quot; One Belt One Road &quot; initiative of the east wind , acquisition , merger , the establishment of factories , and other measures , a leap to the top of the global construction machinery industry .
Among them , the construction machinery leading enterprises such as Trinity Heavy Engineering , China Union Heavy Technology , Iron Construction Heavy Engineering and Shanshan River Intellect are already well ahead of similar enterprises in their output value , market share , sales and other major economic indicators .
It is governed by the times in which the camera moves .
The construction machinery Xiang Army , &quot; Four Jingang &quot; , is the leader of the construction machinery industry cluster of Changsha and the head enterprise of the global construction machinery industry .
It is hard to say who is alive and well in the backwaters of the global industry .
In the early years , the global construction machinery industry experienced a cold winter , and many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturers collapsed , but the construction machinery manufacturers in Changsha treated the &quot; Cat Winter &quot; as a &quot; winter swim &quot; , adding pressure , making breakthroughs and transforming the structure of the industry .
By the stars of the month of the government power .
The development of the dominant industry needs to be done not only by the enterprises but also by the government .
Changsha has a reputation for assembling the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream , creating associated industrial clusters , and reducing R &amp; D , manufacturing and marketing costs by optimizing the business environment , improving supporting services , and simplifying the approval process .
Good business ecology , let the construction machinery manufacturing enterprise .
History has put Changsha into the foreground to create a global leading level of construction machinery , it would be a waste of time .
Whether the Government , enterprises , or even the industry , studies and research and other related links , should seize opportunities , up the momentum , set the target , sustained efforts , in order to build a strong manufacturing power to contribute to the strength of Hunan .
Wang Yi presided over the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African Member States of the Security Council .
China and African countries are good brothers and good partners , Wang said .
China stands firmly with its African brothers , past , present and future .
This foreign ministers &apos; meeting is a concrete initiative to implement the important consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and African leaders at last September &apos;s Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation , to strengthen solidarity and cooperation between China and African countries in the Security Council and to promote better support of the international community in support of peace and development in Africa .
Africa is China &apos;s most important and trusted partner , Wang said .
As a permanent member , China &apos;s vote in the Security Council always belongs to a large number of developing countries , including African countries .
In the face of the new situation , China is ready to work with African countries to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and safeguard common interests in the Security Council .
The two sides should build up strength through unity , resolve disputes through consultation , and strengthen themselves through self-reliance and development .
African foreign ministers present at the meeting thanked China for its initiative in convening the meeting and expressed congratulations on the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China .
The Ministers stated that Africa-China relations are based on equality and mutual respect and that Africa and China have always been each other &apos;s most reliable and reliable partners .
Africa appreciates that China , as a permanent member of the Security Council , has played an important and positive role in African affairs , has vigorously promoted the just and reasonable solution of African problems , and made tremendous efforts and contributions to safeguarding African interests and promoting peace and security in Africa .
Only when security issues are addressed will it be possible to achieve real long-term peace and development in Africa , which is currently facing the threat of terrorism and extremism .

Qingyang , Gansu : Lake sheep as a &quot; way out of poverty . &quot;
September autumn rendering of the Loess Plateau .
At a professional cooperative in the farming town of Hama , the 58-year-old Shavili filled the trough with his last shovelful of grass and stood by the trough , watching the white lake sheep munch .
&quot; Good good , wait for the autumn and winter full of fat , the column can be sold for good prices . &quot;
Shaveli said that his sheep every day to feed the &quot; special nutrition meal &quot; , regular cleaning , sterilization and disinfection , taking care not to pay attention .
Shavili kept sheep for more than 20 years and did not realize how extensive sheep herding used to be until he came to the cooperative where he worked .
Shavili is a resident of Xia Qi Village , Mach Ma Town , Qingcheng County , Qingyang City , Gansu Province .
His left neighbors are sheep farmers , but adhere to the traditional breeding methods , the poor quality of sheep and a small number of errands .
In June this year , under the government &apos;s guidance , 140 impoverished families in the village joined the cooperatives , and everything began to change .
Chevelly delved into farming all day , because he was always suffocating in his mind .
All of the shareholders were poor families who would trust the sheep to the cooperative , counting on him to see if he would be able to pay dividends and sell them at a price by the end of the year .
Fortunately , under the guidance of technicians , he slowly learned to engage in epidemic prevention , mastered scientific feeding , and became one of the few farmers in the village .
The Yimin Breeding Professional Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and a population of approximately 1400 sheep .
Cooperative head Zou Tao said that the standardized sheep shed inside and outside , there are doorways .
&quot; With thick wool and easy breeding ground for bacteria , it is impossible for lake sheep to stay in muggy , damp places . The sheds must be surrounded by furrows on three sides , and must be fitted with an air blower for ventilation .
The sheep sheds should be disinfected regularly and the sheep should be disinfected three to four times a season , Zou Tao said .
&quot; Little Sheep &quot; in addition to living well , have to eat a mixture of silage corn , wheat grass and clover grass , and have a wide enough &quot; playground &quot; to stretch their bones .
The cooperative has adopted the method of substitute breeding in trust , guiding local farmers to put improved breeds of lakes and sheep here for the purpose of raising , management and sale in a unified way , so as to realize well-bred , scientific , standardized and intensive farming .
Today , sheep shares are owned by 140 poor households , and pay dividends of more than $ 6,000 per person per year .
In Qingyang , Gansu , meat sheep farming is not just a change in the mode of feeding , the &quot; dragon-headed enterprise + cooperative + farmer &quot; mode has changed the scene of &quot; sheep raised on hillsides and sold in fairs &quot; , overcoming the small dispersion of traditional farming and ranching , the poor days of farmers have changed for the better as a result of modern sheep farming .
If the market price is weak , the local leading company , Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural Husbandry Development Co . Ltd . , will buy it at a market reserve price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread the market risk , Zou Tao said .
Xu Jianfeng , general counsel of Zhongsheng Agriculture and Husbandry Development Co . Ltd. in Gansu , said enterprises are encouraging more and more poor households to follow the SheepSutra by providing such services as loan guarantee , seed and sheep supply , order farming , quotation and purchase , and unified processing and sale .
In Qingyang , at least 8,200 poor families have steadily increased their income through forage breeding , improved seed breeding , scale breeding , slaughter division and market sale .
Qingyang is located in the northern agricultural and pastoral area and is rich in forage resources .
At present , the city has 913 large-scale sheep farms and cooperatives , raising more than 5 million sheep , and has built two processing lines on the scale of slaughtering up to 1.3 million sheep .
The French finance minister says it will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and calls on Germany to follow suit
Paris ( Reuters ) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ( $ 10.9 billion ) next year and Germany should keep pace with France &apos;s fiscal stimulus to revive its flagging economy , French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday .
Introducing France &apos;s 2020 budget , Lemaire said the ECB &apos;s latest monetary easing had created an opportunity for member governments with the capacity to increase investment .
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to a record low on Sept . 12 , and plans to restart debt purchases to drive down borrowing costs in hopes of stimulating economic recovery and pushing up inflation .
&quot; Low interest rates will not restore European prosperity , and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient , &quot; Lemaire told reporters .
&quot; Germany needs investment , right now , and the sooner the better . Don &apos;t wait until things get worse , &quot; he added .
He has made this appeal to Germany many times .
France has implemented more than 10 billion euros in tax cuts already this year , giving a big boost to France &apos;s economic growth .
And the global economy has run out of steam , with the export-dependent German economy bearing the brunt .
Le Mer points out that the tax burden on French households will ease by € 9.3 billion next year , including € 5 billion in income tax breaks .
In addition , the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost € 1 billion with the gradual implementation of the corporate tax rate from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a period of five years .

Study : U.S. national healthy eating index increase modest but still challenging - UPI.com
The U.S. government &apos;s healthy eating index has increased moderately over the past 16 years , from 56 to 58 , according to a new study .
But with a perfect score out of 100 , this is no cause for celebration .
Americans still face significant dietary challenges .
Americans are still eating too many foods that could lead to heart disease , diabetes and obesity -- the most common diseases among the American people , said Dr. Zhang Fangfang , co-author of the study and a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts .
The study was published online April 24 in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
The study is based on the findings of a U.S. government health survey of 44,000 adults conducted from 1999 to 2016 .
&quot; Despite significant improvements , significant dietary challenges remain , &quot; the authors wrote .
The challenges include getting Americans to cut down on snacks , hot dogs , fat cows , butter and other saturated fats .
The study found that people &apos;s daily intake of these unhealthy fats in their diets increased from 11.5 percent to 12 percent , exceeding the recommended limit of 10 percent .
The biggest improvement in the American diet is the reduction in added sugar from 16 % to about 14 % , but it is still too high .
In the official daily diet , added sugar intake should be less than 10 % .
The reason for the decrease in sugar intake has been linked to a decrease in sweetened soda consumption , but Zhang stressed that sugars are often added to even not-so-sweet foods such as yoghurt and ketchup .
There was a small increase in U.S. adult intake of fruits , nuts , oats , and other whole-grain categories .
Still , 2016 data show that these foods still account for less than 5 % of daily diets .
Although a slight reduction in salt intake and reduced consumption of fruit juices has led to the intake of low-quality carbohydrates , Zhang says they still account for as much as 42 % of daily calories , many of which come from processed white bread and other refined grains .
The study was based on individual health surveys conducted every two years that asked adults to recall which foods they had eaten in the past 24 hours .
These health surveys have asked this question twice every few days since 2003 .
The government &apos;s Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that people adopt &quot; healthy eating patterns &quot; to reduce the risk of chronic diseases .
The guidelines state that people should eat more nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables , fruits , whole grains , low-fat dairy products , and foods that provide protein such as seafood , lean meat , poultry meat , eggs , and seeds .
The number of Americans with diabetes nearly doubled during the study period , to more than 7 % , and the rate of obesity has increased for many years – roughly 70 % of US adults are now overweight or obese .
In addition , heart disease remains the leading cause of death among U.S. nationals .
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia

The forum was held one year after the implementation of the docking strategy on the two continents of the European Union .
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said increased docking was part of the idea because it brought benefits to the peoples and economies involved .
These relations have helped to bring stability and prosperity to all parties involved .

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a special guest of the Forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary meeting .
Bank shares , the country &apos;s first financial management subsidiary to set up a technology and energy management business
On the 26th , Guangda Bank &apos;s wholly owned subsidiary , Guangda Banking Corporation Limited , was formally established in Qingdao , which is the first joint-stock banking subsidiary in China .
Experts said that asset management is an important area of the development of financial technology banks , the establishment of a financial management subsidiary is conducive to the use of technology to improve asset management .
In April , Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank separately announced that they had received approval for the establishment of a financial management subsidiary by the China Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission .
On September 24 , it was announced that the bank was officially open for business .
Just two days later , Guangda Bank led a number of joint-stock banks , the first to set up Guangda Finance in Qingdao .
Li Xiaopeng , chairman of Everbright Group , said that Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation , use the thinking and means of modern technology , rely on big data , the Internet of Things and cloud computing , increase the coverage , usage and penetration of financial capital , and increase customers &apos; sense of access , happiness and security .
By 2021 , we will establish and improve the &quot; four beams and eight pillars &quot; of China &apos;s financial science and technology development , further enhance the application of science and technology in the financial sector , achieve in-depth integration and coordinated development of finance and technology , and significantly increase people &apos;s satisfaction with digital , networked and intelligent financial products and services .
Everbright Institute of Finance chairman Zhang Xuyang said that the financial management platform will use intelligent voting , intelligence research , big data , and other technology to help to make a better judgment of the macroeconomic situation .
New technologies such as blockchain will also be applied in the future to capture the direction and trend from traditional to alternative assets to digital alternative assets .
Faced with a new competitive situation in the asset management industry , financial technology companies and regulators will use capital management technology to explore a new growth path , said Dong Ximiao , a specially appointed research fellow at the National Finance and Development Laboratory .
The power management industry of financial technology is not only the need of the transformation and development of financial technology itself , but also inject new vigor and vitality into the development of financial management business .
Earlier this year , Jingdong Digital Technology launched a new capital management technology system , the use of technology and digital means to improve product R &amp; D and wind-control capabilities .
The new system starts from the four abilities of product design , sales transaction , asset management and risk assessment .
Experts believe that while improving the ability of customer service , innovation and abundant products , it can also enhance the ability of risk prevention and improve management efficiency .
Whereas it used to be easy to target customers &apos; risk bias through questionnaires , the use of artificial intelligence for user portraits could help better position customers , tailor products to their investment preferences and help mitigate risks , Mr Zhang said .
&quot; Other big data , such as electrical merchants and space-time data , can help us to paint a better picture of the activity and climate of a region , an industry . &quot;
&apos;While defusing the risks , big data technology will also help improve wind-control capabilities , &apos; Mr. Zhang said .
Deepest record of Chinese railway tunnel shaft refreshed
After working around the clock for more than 1,200 days , the Da-Lai ( Li ) railway completed the construction of the No. 1 shaft of the Gaoligong mountain tunnel , which reached a depth of 762.59 meters below the surface , breaking the record of the deepest shaft of the Chinese railway tunnel .
The Gaoligong Mountains tunnel , which is 34.5 km long , is the longest tunnel in Asia , running through the Gaoligong Mountains on the west bank of the Nu River .
The tunnel has been described as a &quot; geological museum &quot; for covering almost all of the bad geology and major risks involved in tunnel construction .
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of the Gaoligongshan tunnel , with the important task of increasing the working surface to realize &quot; long and short tunneling &quot; and ventilation for later railway operations .
After the excavation at the bottom of the pit and the replacement of equipment , four additional working surfaces can be added to speed up the opening of the tunnel .
&quot; The shaft is all in the granite , because there are many crevices in the granite , which can &apos;t stop water running from the top to the bottom , no matter how much depth and water pressure the well is . &quot;
China Railway Tunnel Authority Da Rui Railway Project Department Chief Engineer Si Jing Zhao told reporters that the shaft construction , a number of mud inrush , collapse and other dangerous conditions , construction invited experts to control the pulse of the site , more than 20 research and treatment projects .
&quot; When the inrush of water in the shaft is at its maximum , it reaches the bottom at a rate of more than 300 cubic metres per hour , at a depth of more than 700 m , at a pressure equivalent to the ocean floor at a depth of 700 m .
&quot; If water were not drained in time , it would flood 10 meters of wells in an hour , &quot; he said . &quot; We spend almost 85 percent of our time on water control and 15 percent of our time digging , &quot; he said .
In order to overcome the vertical silo No. 1 vertical joint development , mud inrush , water-rich granite and other geological problems , the use of &quot; probing , excavation , &quot; the combination of systematic water control measures , in order to reduce the construction risk .
After many improvements , the construction of the No. 1 shaft has formed a number of mechanized flow lines , including an excavation system , a ballast system , a suspension system , and a winch lift system , allowing for full-process mechanization operations such as drilling , blasting , blasting , installation of formwork , and concrete casting , thus speeding up construction progress .
Eventually , after more than 1,200 days of round-the-clock construction , the shaft was successfully completed at a depth of 762.59 metres .
Da Rui railway length of 330 km , is a part of the China-Myanmar international corridor , is an important part of the implementation of the &quot; One Belt One Road &quot; important transport infrastructure .
When completed and opened for traffic , the travel time from Dali to Ruili will be reduced from the current six hours to two hours , which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in western Yunnan and promote trade and economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries .

Friends circle in the invention of the month , the original today is the Mid-Autumn Festival .
Wash a bunch of grapes sent by friends , leave half to Boo , put the rest in a favorite flower bowl and go out to see the moon .
As Nana sat on the ground , I ate the grapes . She ate the skins , and I spat out the seeds of the grapes far away .
The moon was hidden in the clouds , while the clouds were moving , and there was a twinkling in the bright and in the dark .
a round in the sky / a round in the sky / a round in the sky / a round in the sky / a round in the sky / a round in the sky / a round in the sky / a round in the sky / a round in the sky / a round in the sky / a clean guardrail / a round in the sky .
Maybe we give the moonlight too much emotion , for now I say , in fact , that God &apos;s to God , Caesar &apos;s to Caesar is the best .
Moonlight is the moon , and the mood is yours .
It was chilly on a cold moon after eating the grapes .
Nana &apos;s regiment , with a slight snore at its feet , got up and spread Nana &apos;s little blanket on the edge of her little house , where Nana was lying gladly .
He pulled the door open and exclaimed , Has the bath water burned ?
Can not see the moon from the bathroom window , can only feel the moonlight , turn off the bathroom light and noisily pull back the glass .
No mooncakes , no drinking .

Military &quot; robot dog &quot; first acting class Cirque du Soleil : Consideration for inclusion in the acting lineup .
The US military , which funded the development of robot dogs for the battlefield , may now be the first to enter the circus arena .
Cirque du Soleil has said it is in touch with Boston Dynamics , which develops robots , to discuss the feasibility of using robots in circus shows .
Boston Dynamics released a promotional video for the &quot; quadruped Robot Spot &quot; , showing that Spot is an agile 14-kg mobile robot with high cross-country terrain mobility , 360-degree obstacle avoidance function , navigation , remote control , and autonomy .
In particular , Spot has a proprietary software platform developed specifically for Spot , allowing users to create their own Spot robot capabilities through a variety of applications .
A sensation was created when Boston Dynamics first published the idea of a robotic dog in 1992 , but it is not commercially available yet .
However , Boston Dynamics points out that Spot is already in mass production and the orders are mainly in the construction and energy industry .
In addition , Boston Dynamics is being approached by Cirque du Soleil , which says the project is still at the conception stage and is evaluating Spot &apos;s potential for use in the performance scene .

Did Mahua contest the by-election in Tanjung Biai , Johor ?
Mahua Association President Dato Sili Wei Jiaxiang : &quot; The National Front to the Supreme Council to discuss ! &quot;
Concerns have been raised as to whether Mahua of the BN member party is running for the traditional seat or not .
However , after a meeting of the Central Council , it was announced that it would be up to the BN Supreme Council to decide whether to retain the seat or be replaced by other members of the party .
After chairing a meeting of the China Central Council on Thursday afternoon , Wei told the media that any by-election would be conducted in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures ( SOP ) .
As the Election Commission will not meet until next Monday to finalize the by-election , the BN Supreme Council meeting is expected to be held in early October , he said .
&quot; Yesterday morning ( of the 26th ) I also saw the National Front President Dato &apos; Sri Ahmad Zahi , and we all agreed on the need to reclaim this seat from the League of Hope , &quot; he said .
&quot; We finalise the convening of a special TNI leadership meeting in early October at which the three party leaders will determine which member party will be in the running , &quot; he said .
Asked whether the MCA would insist on the traditional seat to the BN Supreme Council , Wei reiterated that as President of the BN General Council , he had to act in accordance with the standard operating procedures , so any decision would have to achieve BN consensus .
&quot; It is customary to have someone willing to go out , to have a political party and for some quarters to think they should come out in any by-election .
&quot; Above all , what organizations and political alliances do we come from ?
&quot; This is a big test of the political coalition that we have formed over the years , and we believe that the BN has gone all the way and holds some valuable values , &quot; he said .
&quot; In the process , someone might say something , that &apos;s not weird . &quot;
&quot; But the most valuable thing is that once the BN Supreme Council makes a decision , everyone will have to be fully prepared for the fight . &quot;
In any event , Wei said that Mahua would do his best to prepare for the by-election at three levels , namely the District Council , the State Council and the Central Committee .
&quot; The district council will be led by the chairman of the district council , Mr Datuk Seri Wong Sun ; the state council will be led by the acting chairman of the state council , Mr Datuk Lin Pei-hing ; and the central council will be deployed personally by the acting general secretary , Mr Mahanshun , and the general secretary , Mr Andrew Cheung , &quot; the spokesman said .
Congressman Dato &apos; Mohamad Farley , of the Indigenous Unity Party , died of heart failure at the Incumbent Government Hospital , aged 42 , on Saturday .
A villager who hunts wild animals has been ordered &quot; duty to patrol the mountain &quot; in Baokang County , Hubei province
A villager in Baokang County , Hubei Province was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to pay compensation for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of 15,420 yuan ( RMB , the same below ) .
Since the defendant &apos;s family was indigent , the procuratorial authorities used the alternative labor to compensate the ecological restoration expenses , and realized the organic unification of legal effect and social effect .
Through a three-month &quot; obligatory tour of the mountains &quot; and other alternative labor , Zhou had developed a deep relationship with wild macaques and deeply felt remorse for the previous practice of hunting animals , Baokang County Public Prosecutor Wang Zhongliang said on Sunday .
On June 21 , a criminal incidental civil public interest action in the field of ecological resources , brought by the Prosecutor &apos;s Office of Baokang County , was publicly heard and pronounced in the county court .
Chou was sentenced to three years in prison , suspended for four years , fined 3,000 yuan , and ordered to pay 15,420 yuan in compensation for ecological and environmental damage .
According to the investigation , Zhou has set up a power grid on the cliffs since late January 2014 , and has hunted more than 20 wild animals , including impala , muntjac , and foghorn deer .
This is a list of critically endangered species that live in the wild in the wild , and the species is listed on the National Register of Endangered Species .
During the trial , Chou confessed to his illegal facts and conduct , and was willing to assume incidental civil liability .
However , in view of the poor economic situation of the Zhou family , under the coordination of the procuratorate of Baokang County , the local village committee , the forest station and Zhou reached an agreement on alternative labor to compensate for the cost of ecological rehabilitation : by carrying out the work of training and control of monkeys , compulsory patrol of the mountains , and a year of forest protection , public service was provided to cover the cost of ecological restoration .
In response to the prosecutor &apos;s recommendation , the court accepted Zhou &apos;s execution of the suspended sentence along with the obligation to actively perform &quot; alternative labor to compensate for the cost of ecological rehabilitation &quot; .
At present , Zhou Mou has been working in the Macaque Monkey Reserve for three months and is active and performing well .
In recent years , the Baokang county procuratorate has integrated the procuratorial functions and social governance practices in practice , made scientific use of procuratorial advice , investigation supervision and litigation supervision , and used judicial means to minimize the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment .
UN presents Champions of the Earth Award for &apos; The ant &apos;s Forest&apos;
To rapturous applause and loud music , &quot; Ants in the Forest &quot; project leader Xu Dui and user representative Shen Junliang walked to the podium and received the 2019 United Nations &quot; Champions of the Earth &quot; trophy from the host .
The &quot; ant Forest &quot; project that engages hundreds of millions of people in environmental activism through a small mobile phone program was awarded the Inspiration and Action Award at the Champions of the Earth Awards ceremony held on September 26 , 2019 in New York , United States .
Attendees at the United Nations Environment Programme still could not hide their excitement over the prize , which was announced a week ago at its headquarters in Nairobi , Kenya .
He Xiaosheng , executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme , told Xinhua that the &quot; Ant Forest &quot; is an exciting innovation that allows hundreds of millions of people to act to understand the environmental challenges humans face and what humans can do for the environment .
It connects people and the environment with technology , allowing each individual to participate in efforts to protect the planet , and that will have a huge impact .
&quot; Ants Forest &quot; was launched by China &apos;s Ants Financial Services Corporation in August 2016 on the Alipay platform , allowing users to accumulate &quot; green energy &quot; by recording low-carbon actions such as green trips in &quot; ant forests &quot; in their daily lives , paying utility bills online , and &quot; planting trees &quot; on their mobile phones .
Each time a user builds a virtual tree , an &quot; ant forest &quot; and a good partner will plant a real tree in a desertified area .
By August this year , the 500 million &quot; ant forest &quot; users had accumulated 7.92 million tons of carbon emissions and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas .
On the occasion of the &quot; Champions of the Earth &quot; , an award for the country &apos;s environmental efforts , Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado praised the contribution of the &quot; Ants Forest &quot; , saying it was &quot; impressive to have inspired so many people to engage in green action &quot; .
Jing Xiandong , Ant Kingsuit &apos;s chairman and CEO , said the &quot; Champions of the Earth &quot; award was an affirmation of the &quot; Ants Forest &quot; project .
Technology and open platforms make it possible for all to participate in a low-carbon life , an honour that belongs to all participants .
He said the goal was to engage one billion people in low-carbon action over the next three years in the &quot; ant forest &quot; , which had affected 500 million people in the past three years .
While combating desertification and protecting the environment , they are also exploring ways to enable farmers to derive more of their income from green mountains and rivers .
In addition to providing employment opportunities through planting trees , it also hopes to help farmers increase their incomes through agricultural development projects , electrical business platforms , etc .
&quot; ant Forest &quot; the creation of a public welfare environmental protection model based on digital technology has been successfully carried out to sea , and has been used by other countries .
In June , the &quot; e-wallet &quot; GoCash , the largest of its kind in the Philippines , launched a Philippine version of &quot; Ants in the Forest &quot; to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon lives .
GCash will work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and other environmental groups in the Philippines to come up with a plan to plant 365,000 trees within a year , officials said .
Champions of the Earth is the highest prize awarded annually by the United Nations in the field of environmental protection .
&quot; ant Forest &quot; award , after the builder of the Saihanba forest farm in China and the &quot; thousand thousand village demonstration , ten thousand village improvement &quot; project in east China &apos;s Zhejiang Province , the green innovation project from China has won the &quot; inspiration and action &quot; award for the third consecutive year .
Economic and trade frictions affect the U.S. economic &quot; report card . &quot;
The US economic report card for the second quarter of this year showed gross domestic product growth slowed sharply from the previous quarter , hurt by a sharp fall in private sector investment and exports .
Analysts point to trade and economic friction and the resulting uncertainty as the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter .
The final revision released by the US Commerce Department on July 26 showed that second quarter US GDP grew at a 2 % annual rate , on a par with earlier revisions , but significantly lower than the first quarter ’ s 3.1 % .
Consumption growth was the main factor supporting US economic growth in the second quarter , the data showed .
Personal-consumption spending , which accounts for about 70 % of the US economy , grew by 4.6 % in the quarter , boosting the economy by 3.03 percentage points .
In addition , government consumer spending and investment led economic growth by 0.82 percentage points .
In the second quarter , however , private-sector investment fell 6.3 % from the previous quarter , dragging down 1.16 percentage points of economic growth during the quarter ; exports fell 5.7 % from the previous quarter , and net exports dragged down 0.68 percentage points of economic growth during the quarter .
Private-sector investment fell sharply rather than maintain the momentum of growth last year as rising trade and economic friction and uncertainty hit business confidence , says Barry Knapp , managing partner at Ironside macroeconomic consulting firm .
Knapp believes that US corporate capital spending is expected to remain subdued over the next year under the influence of policy uncertainty .
Analysts believe that while consumption growth provided strong support for the US economy in the second quarter , there are increasing signs that trade and economic frictions and the resulting uncertainty have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the outlook for US consumption .
The survey leader , Richard Curtin , a professor of economics at the University of Michigan , said that in a recent survey , 38 percent of consumers spontaneously talked about the negative effects of tariffs on the U.S. economy , the highest level in a year and a half .
On the future direction of the U. S. economy , analysts generally agree that the U. S. economy will continue to slow down .
But some experts say the performance of both the US industrial sector and financial markets would improve if trade and economic frictions were eased .
Kathleen Burch , a global economist at The Economist think tank , predicts that the U.S. economy will continue the gradual decline that it has had so far this year , growing at a slower rate than it did in the second quarter .
Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’ s Analytics , predicts that , assuming that trade and economic friction do not continue to escalate , the US economy will grow by 2.3 % this year , and slow further to 1.6 % next year .
Ellen Hartzen , an investment manager at Putnam Investments , noted that the companies &apos; biggest concern today was trade disputes and the uncertainty they bring . If trade disputes had been resolved , uncertainties would have been greatly reduced and industries would have performed much better than they are now .
Matt Merry , equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management , said trade and economic frictions remain the &apos; top issue &apos; and a major cause of the large swings in U.S. capital markets this year , and whether they are properly resolved will be key in shaping the direction of U.S. capital markets for the rest of the year .
10 days of joint parental leave for parents of children aged 0 to 3 in Ningxia
The protection of women &apos;s legitimate rights and interests is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important symbol of social civilization and progress .
On September 27 , at the 15th Session of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People &apos;s Congress of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region , the Regulation on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was adopted .
This is the first provincial ministry in Ningxia to formulate and enact local regulations on the comprehensive and systematic protection of the legitimate rights and interests of women , which will go into effect on November 1 , 2019 .
To my knowledge , the Regulation has been revised on the basis of the Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People &apos;s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in Ningxia in 2007 , and is divided into 9 chapters and 65 articles , including general provisions , political rights , cultural and educational rights and interests , rights and interests of labor and social security , property rights and interests , personal rights , rights and interests of marriage and family , legal responsibilities and by-laws .
In the Regulations , Ningxia is encouraged to explore the implementation of joint parental leave for married couples , the first of its kind in the country .
The Guidelines on the promotion of the development of care services for infants and children under the age of 3 , issued by the General Office of the State Council in April this year , contain a relevant description of the joint child-rearing of couples .
In the process of revising the Regulations , Ningxia innovatively proposed that employers should be encouraged to grant , to couples with children in accordance with the provisions of the law and the rules and regulations , a joint parental leave of 10 days each year until the children reach the age of 0 to 3 years .
At the same time , the Regulations highlight the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors .
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the most recent legislative achievements in the codification of the rights of personality in the Chinese Civil Code , detailing the constituent elements of sexual harassment , and the subject of and mechanisms for combating sexual harassment .
Article 44 of the Regulations explicitly prohibits the high incidence of sexual abuse of girls and requires related educational , preventive and preventive work in educational institutions to serve as a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation .
With regard to women &apos;s right to information and disposition of marriage and family &apos;s joint property , article 35 of the Regulations clearly sets out women &apos;s right to information in respect of joint property and the obligations of property registration agencies and relevant subjects , and provides women with solid institutional support for the protection of their rights .
In addition , in response to the hot-button issue of gender discrimination in employment , article 26 of the Regulations prohibit not only direct discrimination but also indirect discrimination , draw on the practical experience of recent joint interviews , strengthen punishment for unlawful acts of gender discrimination , and more vigorously defend the legitimate rights and interests of women .
In recent years , the Department of Public Prosecutions and Law , the Ministry of Civil Affairs and other departments of the Ningxia Women &apos;s Federation have achieved remarkable results in promoting and introducing social and professional forces to participate in the mediation of marital and family conflicts and the fight against domestic violence .
These are summarized and appraised in the regulations , and many laws encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources for the protection of women &apos;s rights and interests , and require the people &apos;s governments at and above the county level to provide stable and institutional protection and support through the purchase of services .
Qianjin of broken rice resistant to salt-alkaline rice per mu yield in Yuan Longping Work Station by Academician Yuan Longping , UNITA , Inner Mongolia
Reporter 27 from the General Administration of the Xing UNITA Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was informed that Qianli recently held &quot; Academician Hing UNITA Yuan Longping workstation saline-tolerant rice field yield test &quot; on the good news , the rice breakthrough of more than 1000 jin in the average per-mu yield of saline-resistant rice .
Production by the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Yangzhou University , Hunan Agricultural and Rural Department of six experts , the site of the &quot; Xing salt series &quot; rice sample harvest .
After evaluation by experts , with a pH of 8.8 to 9.6 and salinity content in 5鈥 ? to 6鈥 ? of soil , the average per-mu yield of saline-tolerant rice reached 508.8 kg .
&quot; Our next step is not only to build on this year &apos;s experiments , but also to innovate and reform , to cultivate and optimize the saline-tolerant rice varieties again for better quality and higher yield , &quot; said Wang Shigang , executive director of Xing UNITA &apos;s Yuan Longping work station .
&quot; On the premise that the production factors remain unchanged , I believe that we will continue to strengthen the scientific and technological challenges , and saline-tolerant rice will continue to perform miracles in the saline-alkali fields , &quot; said Lai Yongcai , a researcher and vice president of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Heilongjiang Province .
Xing UNITA is located in the southern foothills of the Greater Xingan Mountains .
In October 2018 , the Xing Group opened its headquarters in Shanghai .
Prof. Yuan Longping led a team of experts to speed up the introduction and popularization of the newly bred hybrid saline-tolerant rice varieties and advanced technology , and to build a saline-tolerant rice base of 960 acres on the right flank of Horqin , with a technical route to be tested and spread , so as to help the local poverty-stricken people to increase their output , increase their incomes and get rid of poverty .
The field measurement of the yield of saline-tolerant rice not only gives hope for the upgrading of UNITA saline-alkali medium- and low-yield fields into medium- and high-yield fields , but also provides a scientific basis for the cultivation of saline-alkali paddy field in China .
After a marathon debate and weeks of protests , New Australia passed a bill legalising abortion on September 26 , local time , the Australia Network reported .

In addition , the Senate passed an amendment that doctors must provide appropriate care to babies who survive a termination of pregnancy .
NSW Governor Berejiklian had previously faced public criticism from conservatives over the bill , and Berejiklian stepped in several times to get more debate time for the bill , but she did not show up for the final vote .
Ms Berejiklian defended his absentee ballot , saying : &quot; I need to take my time to govern the whole new state . &quot;
Australian Liberal MP David Davis , who has been the most vocal opponent of the abortion bill , has threatened to quit the new state government , saying it caused a &quot; government crisis . &quot;
But afterward , Davis relented .
&quot; The content of the amendment to the bill legalizing abortion , which was submitted to the House of Representatives this morning , actually provides additional safeguards for women , doctors , &quot; Davis said .
Meanwhile , Australia &apos;s NSW National Party leader Alfredo Barilaro said he was proud to be part of a government that decriminalised abortion .
&quot; What we achieved last night is historic for the new states , where abortion will be made legal , abortion will no longer be a crime , and women who undergo abortion will not be treated as criminals , &quot; she said .

The central enterprise transfer already has a certain scale .
At the local level , the preliminary work of enterprise transfer is carried out successively .
By the end of 2018 , the pilot project had been basically completed in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces , transferring the state capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan , respectively .
In addition to the pilot provinces , other provinces have successively carried out the preparatory work for the transfer , which laid the foundation for the further implementation of the transfer .
According to the joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance , the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security , the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission , the State Administration of Taxation and the Securities Regulatory Commission , part of the state capital transferred by the central and local governments to strengthen the social security fund will be fully under way in 2019 and will be completed by the end of 2020 .
The meeting held that day made concrete arrangements for a comprehensive roll-out .
The need for the transfer to be done in a pragmatic and efficient manner was stressed .
&quot; The transfer is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2020 .
The working hours are tight and the tasks are heavy . &quot;
All regions and departments should make elaborate arrangements to ensure the completion of the transfer as required ; make solid progress and accurately grasp the contents of the transfer policy ; and strengthen communication and coordination to solve difficult problems in a timely manner , Liu said .
State transfers to enrich the social security fund - &quot; enrich the social security fund money bag &quot; from the starting point , the destination is to provide strong support for old-age security .
However , I believe that this is not a simple equity &quot; physical displacement &quot; , but the opening of the &quot; mathematical addition &quot; .
On September 20 , the Ministry of Finance , the Ministry of Human and Social Affairs , the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission , the State Administration of Taxation and the Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued a notice on a comprehensive way to transfer part of the state capital to strengthen the social security fund , specifying the timetable of the state funds to transfer the social security fund , that is , the central and local authorities to transfer part of the state capital to strengthen the social security fund .
After the document was published , it was quickly implemented by departments such as the Ministry of Finance .
On September 25 , the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 % of its shareholding in the Industrial and Commercial Bank and Agricultural Bank to the social security fund , with a total transfer value of over $ 115 billion .
According to the regulations , the Social Security Fund and other recipients , as financial investors , enjoy the right of benefit , the right of disposition and the right to information .
ICBC , the Agricultural Bank in the announcement said that the change will not cause the controlling shareholders and the actual controllers to change .
In this regard , I believe that the similar SOE equity transfer is not a simple change of ownership , but can stimulate the effects of a series of &quot; addition operations &quot; .
The &quot; addition result &quot; of the first step when some state assets are transferred to social security , of course , is to show that state-owned enterprises are owned by the whole people , and the fruits of development are shared by the whole nation .
After years of reform and development , SOEs , especially the central ones , are in the most important industries and fields in Chinese economy , and the overall profitability is strong and stable .
Among them , the leading enterprises is to continue to do better and better .
On July 10 , the executive meeting of the State Council decided that this year a comprehensive push to transfer part of the state-owned capital to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund .
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it would do its best to enrich the social security fund by pushing aside and transferring part of the state-owned capital in a comprehensive way , in accordance with the plans made at the executive meetings of the State Council , so as to give full expression to the intergenerational fairness of the basic old-age insurance system and the nationwide sharing of the fruits of the development of state-owned enterprises .
Transfer the second step &quot; addition result &quot; , is to strengthen China &apos;s social security fund sustainability , further strengthen the old-age social security system foundation .
With the population aging , China &apos;s social security fund faces pressure , and this time as the main transfer of the national capital , most has the capacity of sustainable profits and dividends , can not only effectively replenish the social security fund , but also provides a living source for the social security fund .
Some estimates show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state capital transferred , the deposit ratio of the basic old-age insurance will be reduced by 1 percentage point .
The third step of the transfer , the &quot; additive result &quot; , is to add stabilizers to the capital markets .
This transfer takes the main body to gain the way is &quot; the dividend mainly , the operation for the subsidiary &quot; .
As a financial investor of state-owned capital , the social security fund is mainly to obtain the equity dividend income .
However , the social security fund , as a value investor in the capital market , has strong capital operation ability .
For the listed assets in the state-owned capital , the social security fund will further optimize the corporate governance structure , improve the management level , and have a positive and positive impact on the listed companies and the capital market .
At the same time , the Social Security Fund as an investment climate vane , shareholding weights , in order to further enhance its influence in the market and play a &quot; stabilizer &quot; role in the market .
In addition , it is beneficial to give full play to the &quot; value discovery &quot; function of institutional investors and guide their rational investment and value investment .
Karl Hartmann entered the Conservatory in Leipzig at the age of 18 , where he studied at Webern .
When the Nazis came to power , Hartmann first resisted and later even stopped producing works that were not published in Germany .
In 1933 , he composed Miserae ( &quot; symphonic suffering &quot; ) and dedicated the work to the &quot; friends of my long sleep &quot; .
The symphony had its premiere in Prague in 1935 , but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats .
After that , Hartmann was determined not to play any of his own works under the Nazis .

Iran confirms development of advanced centrifuges to further suspend implementation of Iran nuclear deal
Iran has once again violated the Iran nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium , according to the United Nations &apos; International Atomic Energy Agency .
It has been reported that the restrictions of the Iran nuclear deal are gradually being violated by Iran in response to US President Donald Trump ’ s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018 and reinstate and tighten sanctions against Iran .
In July , Iran suspended two other commitments to keep its stock of enriched uranium to less than 300 kg and the purity of enriched uranium to no more than 3.67 % , and is now taking further steps .
Under the nuclear agreement , Iran has only been able to install some 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium . In addition , Iran is permitted to use only a small number of more advanced aircraft , but does not produce enriched uranium .
Should it succeed in developing more sophisticated centrifuges , Iran would be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster , possibly for use in the manufacture of nuclear bombs .
&quot; On September 25 , the Agency confirmed that Iran &apos;s development of Type 2 and Type 3 advanced centrifuges ... are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium , &quot; the report said .

China &apos;s development is an opportunity , not a threat or a challenge to the world .
( New China 1970 ) White Paper : China &apos;s development is an opportunity , not a threat or a challenge to the world .
China &apos;s development is an opportunity , not a threat or a challenge to the world , says the white paper .
&quot; With the rapid growth of China &apos;s overall national strength and international influence , some in the international community fear that China will follow the &apos; strong-bar &apos; path , and some have put forward the doctrine of the so-called Chinese threat , &quot; the white paper said .
These include cognitive misunderstandings , deep-rooted prejudices , psychological imbalances resulting from the loss of power , and deliberate distortions in defense of one &apos;s own vested interests .
It is not only the dream of the Chinese people but also the common dream of the people all over the world to realize national prosperity , national rejuvenation and people &apos;s happiness .
&quot; China &apos;s development is an opportunity , not a threat or a challenge to the world .
The white paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and driving force of world economic growth , that China is the largest contributor to world economic growth , that China &apos;s science , technology and innovation is injecting new kinetic energy into world economic growth , and that the role of China &apos;s economic stabilizer and driving force will become more prominent in the future .
At present , there is insufficient momentum of economic growth in the world , and a sound Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world .
China &apos;s economy is shifting from rapid growth to development of high quality , new types of industrialization , informationization , urbanization and agricultural modernization are accelerated , China &apos;s economy undergoes deep structural adjustment , industry optimizes and keeps upgrading , and new economic growth points continue to emerge .
“ The McKinsey Global Institute study finds that by 2040 , economic integration between China and the rest of the world is expected to create an economic value of $ 22 trillion to $ 37 trillion , equivalent to 15-26 % of the global economy , and that increased cooperation between the rest of the world and China will create significant economic value . ”
The white paper stresses that the Chinese economy has become structurally and deeply integrated with the world economy .
With a more stable economic performance , higher quality of growth and predictable growth prospects , China is a long-term positive for world economic development .
If we regard China &apos;s economic development as a &quot; threat &quot; and a &quot; challenge &quot; , it is not feasible and harmful to try to squeeze China out of global industrial , supply and value chains and &quot; decouple &quot; China from the world economy .
The omni-directional opening-up creates more opportunities for countries to share in &quot; China &apos;s dividend &quot; , the white paper said .
China firmly adheres to the win-win strategy of opening up with a view to achieving greater strength and opening up at a higher level , China has the most potential consumer market in the world , China is the most attractive investment destination , and &quot; going out &quot; benefits more countries on a larger scale .
&quot; Rather than one-way , openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial .
A two-way is sustainable in the long run . ”
China has pledged to continuously expand imports , loosen market access , improve the business environment and strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights.Other countries should open wider to the outside world and take corresponding measures to improve their own business environment , the white paper said .
Only when all parties go the opposite way can we create an environment of open , inclusive , inclusive , balanced and win-win development , enlarge the &quot; cake &quot; of development , and form a community of mutual benefit and win-win progress .
China is providing more public goods to the international community , the white paper says .
These include promoting high-quality cooperation to build &quot; One Belt , One Road &quot; ( &quot; One Belt , One Road &quot; ) , building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation , actively participating in international and regional affairs , and actively providing foreign assistance .
&quot; Having benefited from the international community for its development , China has always given something back to the international community , providing it with more and better public goods . &quot;

Protests calling for the president to step down Egyptian authorities demonstrate the strength of the clampdown
Twitter hashtags and social media are trumpeting that Egyptians are taking to the streets today with a peaceful appeal for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ’ s removal from power .
However , the authorities have indicated their intention to use force as a means of repression .
Since 2013 , when then-President Abdel Fattah al el-Sissi seized power in a military coup , the expression of dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt , putting any form of protests at extreme risk .
The Cairo-based non-governmental Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights says more than 1,900 people have been arrested since rare protests erupted last weekend demanding el-Sissi &apos;s removal from power , the Guardian reported .
The corruption allegations that Sessi and his family squandered public money in pursuit of vanity caused thousands of people to take to the streets on the 20th .
Egypt &apos;s Interior Ministry said firmly yesterday that it would act decisively and would not go soft on any attempt to destabilize the country .
Already heavily guarded in central Cairo , riot police , security vehicles , and plainclothes policemen could be seen on the streets surrounding the 2011 Egyptian revolution ’ s flashpoint , Tahrir Square .
Al Jazeera reported that the security forces detained a number of prominent scholars and social figures , including Mohammed Naffa , a professor of political science at Cairo University and a prominent columnist .
He 24 had tweeted : &quot; I have no doubt that the continuation of Cersei &apos;s absolute rule will spell disaster . &quot;
&quot; It is in Egypt &apos;s interest that he step down immediately . &quot;
Hosni &apos;s former spokesman An Nan , the former Egyptian military Chief of Staff , was detained prior to his arrest .
Anan was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sessi for the presidency .
Dawood , the chairman of the Constitution Party , was also taken into custody .
Analysts and politicians believe that the sweeping up of dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of the Government at a time of heightened economic hardship for the poor and the middle class .
Ayman Nour , an opposition leader and former candidate for the presidency , said : “ The capture highlights the regime ’ s disregard for the Egyptian people , and how much it fears for itself . ”
&quot; Because the economy has been squandered by him , coupled with widespread political repression , el-Sissi is trying to send a clear message to the important generals and political figures who might take their place . &quot;
Nohl pointed out that in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation , a heavy-handed approach on the part of the government will only increase the anger of the people .
Now that the fear barrier had been breached , he expected more people to take to the streets .
Businessman and actor Ali , now in exile in Spain and a former Egyptian military construction contractor , began uploading a series of videos of himself benefiting from government corruption , setting off a weekend of small demonstrations in different cities .
Mr. Ali says his company , Amaric , can get lucrative contracts without having to go through a legal bidding process , highlighting widespread corruption in the military and his relatives , including the first lady , Intissar Amer al-Sisi .
He was deeply regretful that he had been involved .
Ali claimed that his magnificent palaces and luxury hotels were in stark contrast to the current destitute lives of Egyptians and that he had not been paid .
On Twitter , hashtags such as &quot; Stand up you &apos;re not alone &quot; , &quot; Sessi You &apos;re finished &quot; , &quot; Sessi &apos;s Roll , &quot; and &quot; Next Friday &quot; have attracted tens of thousands of tweets calling for people to peacefully take to the streets to demand that Sessi step down .
Hollywood Egyptian star Aamawik &apos;s Twitter has nearly seven million followers .
&quot; Selasi is doomed ... He &apos;s finished , and the people who support him are now going to make a blunder , &quot; he tweeted in Arabic yesterday .

Tired of exercise and a tired mind ?
A study of athletes showed that after high-intensity exercise , the brain can also show signs of fatigue , the Russian Satellite Network reported .
The study , led by Mathias Pesigeron , a specialist at the Pitière-Salpetriere hospital in France , shows that there is no clear link between mental and physical labour : both require cognitive control of activity .
&quot; You need to control the autonomous process by which , when you have pain in the muscles and joints , you can force yourself to stop , &quot; he explains .
The study was carried out by the French National Institute of Physical Education and Sport ( INSEP ) .
The school expert is responsible for guiding the athletes to prepare for the Olympic Games .
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome , which is a feeling of irrepressible fatigue after high-load exercise , a lack of physical recovery and a decline in performance .
INSEP poses a question : Could part of the cause of this condition be nerve fatigue , the kind of nerve fatigue caused by excessive mental work ?
The study was published in the journal Current Biology .

Qualification is needed for the social capital to acquire the right to manage rural land
Qualification is needed for the social capital to acquire the right of rural land management
The Measures on Rural Land Management Right Transfer Management publicly solicit opinions on the supervision of the land management right acquired by the transfer of industrial and commercial enterprises and other social capital
Yesterday , the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published a notice soliciting opinions from the public on the Measures on the Transfer of the Right to Land Management Management in Rural Areas ( the Revised Draft Exposure Draft ) ( hereinafter referred to as the Draft Opinions ) , which increase the supervision and guard against the risks of acquiring the right to the management of land through the transfer of social capital , including industrial and commercial enterprises .
The Draft Opinion is now eliciting comments from the public .
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs stated that it had revised the Measures for the Administration of the Transfer of Rural Land Contracting and Management Rights and formed the Draft Opinions in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contracting Law , further consolidate and improve the rural basic management system , deepen the reform of the rural land system , and implement the &quot; separation of three rights &quot; system .
A reporter from the Beijing Youth News learned that several important changes had been made to the Draft Opinion , which was published for the first time .
The newly revised Rural Land Contract Law clarifies the scope of land circulation , implements the concept of &quot; separation of rights &quot; , establishes the terms &quot; land contract management rights &quot; and &quot; land management rights &quot; respectively in a special section , and makes a clear distinction between the transfer and interchange of land contract management rights and the transfer of land management rights ( lease , subcontract , purchase of shares or by other means ) .
In the Draft Opinions , in order to implement the concept of &quot; separation of rights &quot; and as an effective response to the thrust of the revision of the Rural Land Contracting Law , and taking into account the significant differences between the transfer of land management rights and the swap and transfer of contracted land management rights , the revised draft defined the scope of land circulation , focused on the transfer of land management rights , including leasing and purchase of shares , and changed the title of the rules from the administrative measures for the transfer of contracted land management rights to rural land to the administrative measures for the transfer of rural land management rights .
The administrative measures for the transfer and swap of the contracted management right of land will be formulated separately .
&quot; Draft Views &quot; pointed out that in the &quot; separation of three rights &quot; background , the farmer shares only the land management right for a certain period of time .
In theory , farmers are only at risk of losing their operational rights for a certain period in the event of a bankruptcy liquidation , and providing for the return of contracted land to the original contractor is therefore no longer legally necessary and in conflict with the Bankruptcy Code .
Aiming at the problem of guarding against the risk of farmers &apos; losing land , the practice produces the methods of preferred shares , shares after lease , repurchase and so on .
In view of the mature theoretical discussion of preferred shares in the Company Law , it is suggested that it should be used as an advocacy regulation to safeguard against the risk of loss of land .
