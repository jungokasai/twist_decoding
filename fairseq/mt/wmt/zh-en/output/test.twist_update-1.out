A comprehensive foreign media report , the IAEA report , said advanced centrifuges at Iran &apos;s Natanz Nuclear Facility &quot; are accumulating , or are ready to accumulate , enriched uranium . &quot;
Since US President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal last May and imposed sanctions on Iran , Iran is gradually violating the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers .
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only refine uranium using first-generation IR-1 centrifuges .
The other signatories of the deal , Britain , China , France , Germany and Russia , have been trying to salvage it , but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough .

The women &apos;s volleyball team is expected to defend the World Cup ahead of schedule !
In a match against the Dutch women &apos;s volleyball team , the Chinese team won two games in a row and went on to win the match 3 – 1 against the Dutch .
The World Cup schedule is drawing to a close , although the defending champions are in sight , but the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team still have to take it easy on the Serbian team .
In the first two sets of the match against the Netherlands , the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team continued to perform strongly , going down 25 – 19 and 25 – 16 , respectively , until the third set , when the team suffered a setback .
The Dutch women &apos;s volleyball team stepped up their serve in the back-and-forth situation , the Chinese team suffered a shock , and the girls attacked with eagerness , the errors also began to increase , finally at 21 : 25 was the opponent back to a city .
In an interview after the game , Lang Ping also said : &quot; In the third game , because of the mistake we gave about eight points . &quot;
Of course , the Dutch women &apos;s volleyball team can not be underestimated , the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team also made a difficult preparation before the match , although lost a game , but everything is still in Lang Ping master , &quot; with the strong team to win the game is normal , playing five games is normal , so we say to the players to focus , &quot; Lang Ping said .
In the fourth set , the players adjusted to the situation , Zhang Changning in the offensive end of the full open fire , a single-game score of 8 , for the team to win .
There are only two rounds left in the 11-round rivalry , and the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team , though one hand has already touched the championship trophy , did ring alarm bells in their match against the Dutch : the more critical the moment , the more they will go all the way .
In another match on the 27th , Russia and the U.S. women &apos;s volleyball team played a full five games , the U.S. team was unable to take all three points from their opponents , so the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team only had to take all three points against Serbia to secure the title one round ahead of time .
All kinds of circumstances are moving in favour of the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team .
However , the absence of all six of Serbia &apos;s main players does not mean that they will give the three points to China easily .
In their current form , Serbia are virtually out of medal contention , which means they can &quot; light up &quot; their game against China &apos;s women &apos;s volleyball team , leaving the burden on them to do their best to beat their opponents , while China , under pressure to win the title , may be in a state of ups and downs .
Furthermore , the substitute Serbia team was not a &quot; slaughterhouse &quot; of the Lamb , as shown by the depth of the Dutch full-strength squad , which was defeated by Serbia 2 – 3 in the last five games of the World War II .
Before the third stage of the match , Lang also said that neither team could cope : &quot; The game in Osaka is going to be very difficult , we still have to prepare as well as ever . &quot;
Now the bugle has been blown and the race has truly entered the &quot; white-hot phase . &quot;
On the strength of the lineup , the Chinese women &apos;s volleyball team is on top of the opponent , only the final critical moment , but also to see if the girls will be able to play a normal level , on the field of play free of ego .

&quot; For 70 years , both deterrence and defensive measures taken by NATO have been based on maintaining technological superiority , &quot; Stoltenberg said in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point .
But times are changing , he says .
&quot; We have encountered increasing competition , &quot; Stoltenberg said .
We must therefore now redouble our efforts to be sure that no one will surpass us .
&quot; Some of the new technologies have not been developed by NATO members , but in authoritarian countries , &quot; he said .
Chinese companies are working on 5G networks .
Russia is developing an independent Internet and investing heavily in the development of the next generation of weapons , such as hypersonic missiles , he said .
Stoltenberg said NATO &apos;s future security &quot; depends on the ability to understand , accept and apply the latest advanced technology . &quot;
On September 24 , &quot; a boat ticket to take me to see &quot; the charity event was held in Tzu Chau , Changsha , and more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Orange Star Cruises to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River and celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China .
Most of the more than 100 people with disabilities who took part in the event were on board the cruise for the first time .
Zhao Zhengang , 56 years old , is a mutilated person who rarely leaves the house because of the immobility of his feet .
&quot; Today is the first time to take a cruise , Xiangjiang close to enjoy the spectacular , feel the pulse of the development of Changsha , the mood is very excited , unforgettable , &quot; he said .
Volunteers from the Fukang Social Work Service Center in Changsha City and the Blue Sky Rescue Team provided a nuanced service for people with disabilities .
Especially for people with severe physical disabilities , volunteers will carry them on cruises .
Over the past 70 years , with the support of the Communist Party and the government , more and more people with disabilities have become participants , contributors and beneficiaries of social and economic development in Changsha .
The Republic is about to celebrate its seventieth anniversary , and the spotlight of the media shines brightly on so many images that we do not normally remember shimmering - it is they that bring heat and light to our shining days .
However , if the hero walks around , also seems to be ordinary as you as me .
Yuan Longping , the chief scientist of China &apos;s &quot; heavenly eye &quot; , a man , a lifetime , a pot and a lifetime of doing only one thing , chomping on cold buns in the mountains of Guizhou , and no different from the old man in Zhaoyizi ; Zhou Ruchang , a red-haired , late village boy , who still goes to school like a red child , speaks of learning to the heart and laughs ; Qin Yi , an artist of half a day , is over ninety years of age and happy to play the role of an old handmaid in a play that jolts six or seven hours a day on the plateau . . . . .
They live plainly , simply , and persistently , if they immerse themselves in things that outsiders do not understand , and they do not care about fame , expediency , wealth , and glory .
As in Jin Yong &apos;s novel , the Shaolin Temple , the temple of the scavenging monk , though with the world of martial arts , do not dazzle , no glory , no sorrow .
Every &quot; sweeping monk &quot; , every gibbon heart , behind which there is a share of my own country to bear .
Nations bear , not only the shoulders of heroes , but also the hearts of millions of people .
Once , the words of a female middle school student , by netizens crazy turn , &quot; when the hero is passing , always someone sitting on the roadside clapping . . . I do not want to be a hero , I want to be sitting on the roadside clapping . &quot;
Actually , being a hero and applauding a hero are not contradictory .
Roadside clapping , also in the transmission of heat and light , its own luminous body .
Ordinary like you , like me , there are always some opportunities in life , there are some moments , there is a accumulation of time , also in the shape of the appearance of heroes .
Zou Bihua , an excellent judge in Shanghai , was charged with the task of judicial reform , but at the annual conference , he sent and received thousands of letters from newspapers and newspapers to tell his story , and &quot; do simple things well , that is not simple &quot; . Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to the &quot; sweeping monk &quot; type of old man .
It is a sign of respect between heroes . It is a sign of a hero applauding another hero .
There is the Shaolin Temple in Shaolin , Yuan Longping has a vast experimental paddy field , Nan Ren Dong has a &quot; heavenly eye &quot; , Qin Yi has a stage , Zhou Ruchang has a pulpit ...
&quot; China &apos;s Eye &quot; , for example , now seems to be a myth .
In the 1990s , the Chinese scientific and technological community was still climbing hard , and the novelist Liu Cixin had yet to write &quot; The Three Characters . &quot;
The most bovine &quot; eye &quot; of all time was the single-aperture radio telescope Arecibo , 350 meters in diameter , in the valley of the American island of Puerto Rico , considered the &quot; unsurpassable &quot; world &apos;s largest .
The Chinese radio telescope at that time was less than a tenth the diameter of a human .
But Nan Rendong , who enjoys world-class research conditions and a salary in Japan , insists on returning home , bringing back an almost crazy idea : to build a new generation of radio &quot; big telescopes &quot; in China to receive more messages from outer space !
China is ready for the fun of it , so invest big money to play the stars ?
The motherland trusts Nan Ren Dong , &quot; the eye of the heavens &quot; project is grand and grand .
The project took 12 years to complete and another 9 years to complete .
With the opening of the 500-meter skyline , China has made “ the world ’ s only major scientific project ” without precedent .
Therefore , the &quot; eyes of heaven &quot; is great , the Nan Ren Dong people are great , there is a big tolerance , standing high and far out of the Republic is great .
With the trust of the state and the goodwill of the people , the Nan Ren East people have the opportunity to become the soul of the country and the heart of the people .
There are young talents , white-haired heroes affable past , there are people gently clapping on the roadside , such a country , very beautiful and harmonious .

Jacques Chirac &apos;s political legacy endures
Former French President Jacques Chirac died at the age of 86 .
At a time when the world is in the grip of a century of unprecedented change , the French statesman still deserves credit for the many political legacies he left in office .
Mr Chirac has been France &apos;s president for 12 years in a charismatic role .
He inherited Gaullist independence of the diplomatic spirit , but also firmly support European integration , is a representative of the pursuit of the &quot; European dream &quot; .
At the same time , he was a strong advocate of world multipolarity and multilateralism , and a strategically minded politician .
He was described in the French press as &quot; France &apos;s outstanding representative on the world stage &quot; .
One of Chirac &apos;s most popular political decisions was his opposition to the American-led war in Iraq .
Under his leadership , France joined Germany in the face of American pressure and went to the forefront of the anti-war movement .
A year after the war broke out , he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an intensification of terror and make the world more dangerous .
As it turned out , Chirac ’ s warning was correct .
At a time when European integration is at a loss and American unilateralism is on the rise , Chirac ’ s strategic thinking and decisions on international politics and global affairs are of great enlightenment .
Chirac is also a French statesman who makes the Chinese feel familiar and affectionate .
He was one of the initiators and creators of the &quot; Golden Decade &quot; between China and France . After his first election as President of France in 1995 , he promoted the rapid development of China-France relations with the strategic vision of statesmen .
In 2004 , China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership .
Under Chirac &apos;s administration , bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly , and the two countries have made breakthroughs in many areas , including aviation , nuclear energy and rail transport .
Chirac initiated the Year of Sino-French Culture , creating a completely new cultural exchange pattern in the history of China and France .
Chirac &apos;s lifelong devotion to Chinese culture was particularly impressive .
Chirac can memorize some poems by Li Bai and Du Fu , and even accurately judge the historical age of Chinese bronzes , according to Chinese diplomats who know him .
&quot; Not looking at the pyramids , not really going to Egypt , not looking at the Qin Terracotta Army , not really going to China &quot; - the gold phrase comes from Chirac .
&quot; The West is concerned about China &apos;s political and social development , ecological issues arising from China &apos;s economic growth and China &apos;s political position in the world , &quot; Chirac said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua .
But I myself have confidence in China .
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization , and that its experience is sufficient to help it establish the concepts and values for harmonious development and assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time to come .
I also believe that China &apos;s renaissance will bring new creative energy to world culture and enrich world culture .
The Sri Lankans are gone , but Chirac &apos;s legacy and enlightenment to the world will endure .

The Hong Kong Bill was opposed by members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Some members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council ( LegCo ) issued a joint statement on 27 July , expressing strong opposition to the passage of the &quot; Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Democracy 2019 &quot; by the Foreign Affairs Committee of both houses of the US Congress .
The statement , which was co-authored by 40 Founding Members , said Hong Kong currently enjoyed the rights conferred by the Basic Law , including the right to maintain a free trade port and a separate customs territory , to enter into and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements with different countries and regions of the world in the name of &quot; Hong Kong , China &quot; in various fields , including the economy , finance , shipping , trade , communications , tourism , culture and sports .
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature .
Over the years , Hong Kong has strictly adhered to international agreements , rules , laws and business ethics , conducted business with various countries and regions , and engaged in cooperation in a wide range of related areas .
The statement said the U.S. House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committee &apos;s move to pass the bill was unnecessary and was merely a response to a call by its Hong Kong agents to intervene in Hong Kong &apos;s internal affairs and gain political leverage for their agents in Hong Kong .
Members of the Founding Fathers expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the move .
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the source of the largest trade surplus .
The rule of law , a fair and free business environment and a clean society make Hong Kong a good location for American businessmen to do business .
This bill , in addition to hurting Hong Kong and the interests of the US itself , would make the Sino-US relationship even worse .
Hong Kong will , as always , unswervingly implement the policy of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; , continue to enjoy its rights under the Basic Law and earnestly fulfill its obligations , the statement said .
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international commerce in the past , present and future .
26 ( Xinhua ) -- Both houses of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reforms next week , according to the European Times .
French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that France cannot &quot; accept everyone &quot; , but at the same time work to &quot; properly accommodate &quot; .
Reports suggest that Macron is trying to find a middle ground on immigration to soften the impact of the looming debate .
In a recent interview in New York , the US , on the sidelines of the general debate of the UN General Assembly , Macron said he wanted a genuine two-pronged approach to immigration policy , one that struck a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency .
&quot; If France wants to be able to accommodate ( migrants ) properly , it cannot accommodate everyone , &quot; Macron said .
Macron outlined four priorities of his migration policy : granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible ; promoting the integration of migrants more efficiently ; receiving and protecting all migrants entering French territory ; and more efficiently resettling those who entered France illegally and were not suitable to stay .
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the state medical aid system has been the subject of much debate .
Mr Macron said he hoped to &quot; assess &quot; the system , but not remove it , but limit it .
Following Macron ’ s remarks , Le Pen , the leader of the far-right “ National Alliance , ” tweeted that Macron ’ s position was “ empty talk . ”
A member of the right wing Republicans , Senate President Ruschel also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a &quot; softened &quot; but &quot; realistic &quot; way , indirectly criticizing Macron .
Vallau , a leftist Socialist MP , argued that France should “ accept more and better ” on the issue of immigration , and criticized Macron for “ playing around ” with the issue .
A year after its enactment , a new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has divided opinion in the ruling party but failed to placate right-wing opposition parties , the report said .
Macron will need to do something about immigration policy , which will again be the focus of far-right attacks in the next general election in 2022 , but he will also risk angering the ruling party ’ s insiders on the left .
The lower house of the French National Assembly is reportedly set to debate immigration policy from 30 September , while the Senate will debate it from 2 October .
There are signs that “ buy back ” is coming to China ’ s A-shares , with many listed companies offering to buy back their shares in “ real gold and silver . ”
According to financial data service Oriental Wealth , as of 27 December 2019 , the total value of the buybacks of A-share listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan ( RMB , the same below ) , which is far higher than the previous year &apos;s figures .
In response , Xu Yang , chairman of Shanghai-based Michael Rong Information Consulting LLC , said the low overall valuation of the A-share market this year and the use of relatively low prices to buy back shares would benefit listed companies &apos; efficiency in the use of funds , reflect the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market capitalisation and ample cash flow , helping to boost investor confidence .
In addition , the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system , listed companies also actively promote share repurchase .
For example , earlier this year , the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules for the implementation of share repurchase by listed companies , providing detailed criteria and guidelines for share repurchase by listed companies .
According to media statistics , the listed companies that have implemented the buyback program this year are concentrated in the infrastructure industry , the real estate industry , the information technology industry and the electronics industry .
In addition , in terms of repurchase payments , six listed companies have repurchased more than 1 billion yuan this year .
At the top of the list was Yili &apos;s stake , which was repurchased for more than $ 5 billion .
What impact will the buyback of shares by listed companies have on the market ?
Zhao Xijun , vice dean of the School of Finance and Finance of Renmin University of China , told China News Agency that the buyback shows that the listed company has strong economic strength and a better financial position , and is able to maintain stock price stability and give investors confidence , on the one hand , and that the listed company and its controlling shareholders are responsible to the company , to the market and to investors , on the other .
The former is based on the company &apos;s good operating performance , the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have higher quality .
For the capital market , this is the most central element of the foundation .
The buyback of shares of listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the stock prices of listed companies .
Based on the estimated number of share repurchases made by A-share listed companies as a whole since the beginning of this year , as well as the average transaction price of the repurchased shares , the amount of incremental funding for the A-share market from the repurchase of shares is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan this year , according to the Oriental Securities Research Institute .

In order to protect and save the mural of Mazu , the administration committee of Ancient Culture Street and the Temple of Heaven initiated the restoration of the Temple of Heaven and the inner fresco .
The restoration project , led by Cai Changkui , involved four famous Chinese painters .
The restoration work is based on the principle of &quot; restore the old as old as the old &quot; , but also the original fresco made local content adjustment , the original fresco was not perfect for the supplementary restoration .
In restoration , we have also made innovations and experimented with colours , materials , pen and ink .
After the restoration , the original fresco features , spirituality , spirit and artistic style were preserved .
Built in 1326 , the palace was originally known as the Temple of the Lady , but has been rebuilt several times , making it the oldest building in the city of Tianjin and one of the earliest extant Mazu temples in China .

Wang Boxiang , Communist Party Secretary of Shouguang County , Shandong
Wang Boxiang , born in February 1943 in Shouguang , Shandong Province , worked as a Communist Party secretary , county party secretary , mayor and so on .
In 1986 , Wang Boxiang was the party secretary of Shouguang County in Shandong Province , at the time the Shouguang was the poor county of Weifang .
During his five years in office , Wang concentrated on three things : first , promoting the industrialization of vegetables ; second , developing the Shoubei salt flats ; and third , laying the foundation for industrial transformation .
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables , but also lessons in growing vegetables .
In the early 1980s , Shouguang farmers had a bumper crop of vegetables that could not be sold and were rotten in the fields .
Wang Boxiang investigation found that the key to capture vegetables is to do a good job of circulation .
Shouguang was the first to set up a vegetable wholesale market , opened the prelude to the development of the market economy .
Party officials should take the lead , mess up , all the losses in the county burden .
In 1989 , with the support of Wang Boxiang , 17 members of the party set up 17 winter warm vegetable huts in the village .
In the first year , more than 5,000 vegetable shacks were set up in the county , and the vegetable shack spread as far as the county and country as a whole .
For thousands of years , Shoubei 1.6 million acres of land in addition to salt alkaline beach , is a shallow beach .
The life of the local people was hard .
ShouNan has the vegetable canopy , how does ShouNan do ?
Wang Boxiang organized tens of thousands of people to fight a battle , in the wild alkaline beach camp , a dry is 40 to 50 days .
At that time , Shoubei developed a lobster pond of 150,000 mu , a salt field of 200,000 mu , and a cotton field of 600,000 mu .
In July 1986 , Wang participated for the first time in the Weifang City Industrial Conference as the county party secretary .
During the meeting , issued a &quot; Weifang city twelve counties urban industrial economic figures comparison table &quot; , at first glance industrial gross output value , longevity is good , ranked fourth .
However , if the original salt is removed , Shouguang &apos;s pure industrial output would be only 119 million yuan , ranking third from the bottom .
Wang Boxiang took more than 70 people to take the tour , running to the field &quot; to change his mind . &quot;
Less than a year later , the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects .
Since then , it has organized annual study tours to Shenzhen , Dongguan and Shanghai .
There is a dearth of businesses , and a dearth of entrepreneurs .
Wang Boxiang chaired the panel : in the county open selection of the plant director , 40 &quot; enterprising talents &quot; stood out , was pushed to the front line of the industry .
In 1991 , Shouguang entered the ranks of the country &apos;s top 100 counties , and Wang Boxiang was transferred to Weifang as vice mayor .
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable huts , 1.2 million acres of cotton , salt and shrimp ponds , 4,854 enterprises , and more than 100,000 &quot; thousand yuan households &quot; , a cadre approved by the people , who still affectionately call him &quot; our uncle secretary &quot; .
On September 26 , 2006 , Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the meeting of Foreign Ministers of China and African member states of the UN Security Council at the UN headquarters in New York .
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the current member states of the Security Council in Africa , Côte d &apos;Ivoire ( Tano ) , Equatorial Guinea ( Oyono ) , South Africa ( Pandor ) , Niger ( Kalla ) and Tunisia ( Jishnawi ) attended the meeting .
Wang Yi made four proposals on strengthening China-Africa cooperation in the Security Council .
First , by uniting our forces .
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism . As a direct consequence , the basic norms governing international relations have been challenged , and the role of the United Nations has been undermined , to the detriment of the interests of developing countries , small and medium-sized countries , including African countries .
The response to this challenge requires the strength of unity , hand in hand and side by side with the Central African Republic .
In the Security Council , where the three African countries speak with one voice , the weight of the focus is not just on three votes , but on the continent as a whole .
By standing together , China and Africa will not be just four votes , but will lead other countries to follow suit , influencing and shaping the Council &apos;s agenda .
Since 2018 , China and African members of the Security Council have established the &quot; 3 + 1 &quot; coordination mechanism , which should be fully utilized .
Secondly , to settle disputes by negotiation .
China has always advocated political settlement of hotspot issues.Africa has a good tradition of consultation and the experience of successful mediation by African regional and sub-regional organizations .
Many of the complex dilemmas on the Council &apos;s agenda , in particular the hot spots in Africa , are mostly rooted in colonialism or are directly related to external factors .
We should make joint use of Chapter VI of the UN Charter to bring into play the role of the UN in mediation and mediation .
Third , rely on independence to seek self-improvement .
African countries and peoples know their problems best , and Africa has the capacity and wisdom to solve its own .
In dealing with hot issues in Africa , the Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa , should play the role of regional and subregional organizations , and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa .
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote the capacity building of African independent peace operations .
Fourthly , development is fundamental to the rule of law .
China and African countries are both developing countries.We must put economic and social development first and support each other in the road of development that we have chosen .
China is ready to work closely with the African Union Agenda 2063 , the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the development strategies of African countries to help them enhance their capacity for development and eliminate the root causes of conflicts .
We should jointly urge the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa &apos;s development .
China has made and will continue to make every effort to provide assistance , provide human and material assistance within its capacity , coordinate actions with African countries , mobilize the United Nations and WHO to increase their aid efforts , and give full play to the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUSCO ) .

Trudeau ’ s “ collapse , ” and will he succeed in his second term
This time Trudeau stumble out of a &quot; big hole &quot; , it is Trudeau himself a little bit dug out .
In recent days , the Canadian media have been ablaze with old photos of Prime Minister Trudeau posing as a black man .
This was seen as a clear act of racial discrimination that immediately caused a stir in Canada .
After it happened , Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public .
The Canadian public , however , is not buying much .
Trudeau was able to lift a rock and throw it at his feet .
As political commentator Riley and others have pointed out , since the rise of the anti-blackface movement in the United States , Trudeau and the federal Liberal Party have been vocal in accusing opposition parties or dissidents within their own party of &quot; big losses &quot; in this regard , and have repeatedly threatened that &quot; whoever makes this mistake should be expelled immediately &quot; .
In short , it was Trudeau himself who dug the &quot; big hole &quot; by stumbling across it this time .
Trudeau is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . He is young and handsome . When he first started out , he had a whirlwind of &quot; political icons &quot; .
After taking over as head of the federal Liberal Party , he had an unexpectedly good fight in the 2015 federal legislative election , in which the Liberal Party won a majority of the seats in the lower house of the federal Parliament , securing a valuable individual cabinet .
At the time , Trudeau put forward a number of radical platforms and ideas , such as “ ethnic and gender equality , ” “ environmental protection , ” “ economic revitalization , ” and an emphasis on ending corruption and “ bad wind . ”
In his five years in power , however , he has “ gone low ” on almost all of these fronts .
In the case of “ ethnicity and gender equality , ” he had previously “ spoken out ” on a series of aboriginal issues , leading aboriginal groups and leaders to move protest tents to Capitol Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada ’ s founding .
In the fight against corruption , Mr. Trudeau became embroiled in a &quot; Randall case &quot; at the beginning of last year .
It was revealed that he had committed major irregularities against his hometown construction company , Lanwanling , by pressuring the authorities and officials in charge of the investigation to &quot; raise their hand &quot; .
Moreover , Trudeau , when things went wrong , moved to anger at the officials who disclosed the fraud – Wang Zhoudi , as mentioned earlier , was the first Canadian attorney general to directly handle a case of fraud .
Although the case itself is questionable , its suspicions are difficult to wash away .
Many observers point out that the collapse of Trudeau ’ s five years in power was largely the result of his own “ pit ” , and that the three largest “ pits ” were those of “ self-harming ” and “ being more generous than himself and more strict than a lawyer . ”
Canada ’ s most authoritative Anguss-Reed poll data shows that , from 2015 to the present , Trudeau supporters have slipped from more than 60 % to more than 30 % , while opponents have soared from less than 30 % to more than 60 % .
Although other opposition parties and their party leaders have performed equally poorly , a significant proportion of voters who are still willing to vote for the federal Liberal Party now view the chancellor , the head of the ruling party , with disapproval .
On October 21 , when the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin , can Trudeau repeat the repertory of his big win five years ago ?
The answer may be just one word : Difficult .
Whether from the competition level of enterprises , consumer experience level , regional aviation integration , Beijing-Tianjin-Ji development integration level , it has a profound impact and positive significance .
On September 25 , Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened .
The new Beijing News reporter from the Beijing Development and Reform Commission informed that the capital airport has been in a state of oversaturation , the opening of Daxing International Airport , will enhance the capital air service capacity .
After Shanghai , Beijing has become the second city in China to have two airports , with Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport serving domestic aviation and Pudong International Airport serving international aviation .
Daxing Airport , from the business development perspective , for the capital airport is more of a positive impact .
In 2018 , the airport handled over 100 million passengers , which is the highest passenger throughput in the country , although there is still a significant capacity gap compared to the rapidly growing business needs , especially for international routes .
In order to better serve domestic and international passenger travel and business travel needs , and in line with Beijing &apos;s increasingly open , internationally aligned urban development , Daxing International Airport is located as a large international hub airport , planning to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million passengers and 4 million tons of cargo and mail throughput in the future .
Therefore , the two airports do not overlap , targeted at different customer groups , but also have sufficient market space .
From an economic point of view , the opening of Daxing International Airport will obviously have a win-win effect , easing the tension in Beijing &apos;s air capacity , accelerating the growth of passenger and cargo throughput , and creating an incremental cake for the capital &apos;s aviation dual-core operations .
From the point of view of the user , with the Daxing International Airport , it is not necessary to concentrate on the Capital Airport in the future , but also to reduce the number of problems caused by the concentration of routes , such as the longer security time , slower check-in speed of passengers , indirect increase of aircraft and passengers &apos; stay in the airport , increasing the burden of airport operations , reducing the burden of passengers &apos; travel through the Capital Airport , and actually improving the passenger experience .
According to the media estimates of the time and cost of a variety of transport routes to large international airports , such as going from the South Fifth Ring to Beijing and going directly to Daxing Airport for 50 minutes to drive , oil money back and forth about 40 yuan , high-speed cost of 15 yuan ; but the choice of rail transit Daxing Airport Line , based on the distance of 20 km , 30 km , the fare is divided into 10 yuan , 25 yuan , 35 yuan three times ; citizens can also travel between Beijing and Xiongcheng City Intercity , from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport Station only more than 20 minutes .
In general , there are a variety of transport options available to the public , and the cost and time are within a reasonable range .
From the perspective of trend development : Daxing airport is located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub , so the distance from the Beijing urban area is a little bit , but enhanced radiation to Hebei , Tianjin , facilitate more people to travel , for the promotion of the economic development of Hebei , Tianjin is of great significance .
In the future , passengers in Hebei and Tianjin can enjoy more international air services provided by Daxing International Airport , which can be seen in the transportation planning of Daxing Airport .
In addition to the new airport line from downtown Beijing to Daxing Airport , a number of expressways connect Daxing Airport with the surrounding areas .
Just as urban passengers from Dongguan , Foshan , Qingyuan and other cities in Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via the Guangzhou Buddha , Guang Shen and other highways , so residents from Langfang , Xiong &apos;an New Area and other places around Beijing will benefit from the Daxing Airport for convenient and efficient air services .
It can be seen that the opening of Daxing International Airport is more than just the addition of a few runways and a few planes , whether from the level of enterprise competition , the level of consumer experience , or the level of regional aviation integration and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration , it has a profound influence and positive significance , not only on the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing , to provide a variety of options for the travel of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei residents , to further promote the quality of service of Beijing &apos;s shipping industry , to promote the process of integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei , but also to promote the economic and trade development of the areas surrounding Daxing Airport .
Therefore , for the Daxing airport navigation , we are not only the economic accounts of individual accounts , but also the overall development of the account .

2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Forum held in Thanh Thanh Thanh Province
The deputy head of Vietnam &apos;s National Assembly Economic Committee , Nguyen Duc Jian , revealed that at the beginning of this year , Vietnam &apos;s economic and social development showed many new signs of improvement and continued to grow .
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019 , and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020 .
At the forum , participants had an in-depth exchange of views and views on four themes : economic developments in 2019 and the impact of selected FTAs , some salient issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019 , salient issues in the Vietnamese society and culture in 2019 , as well as projections and recommendations for the economic and social development of Viet Nam in 2020 .
There was general agreement that the first few months of 2019 had witnessed a slowdown in global economic growth and increased risks and challenges .
Trade frictions among the major economies further shrink global trade and investment .
The International Monetary Fund has concluded that , despite uncertainty in the global economy , in which 70 % of the world ’ s economies have stagnated , Vietnam ’ s economic growth has been encouraging , with stable macroeconomic performance and effectively controlled inflation , with the consumer price index growing at an average of 2.64 % in the first half of 2019 , the lowest rate in nearly three years .
GDP grew by 6.76 % in the first half of 2019 , down from 7.05 % in the same period last year , but still at a higher rate than the same period in the 2011-2017 period .
In a forecast of economic development trends in Vietnam in 2019-2020 , Deng Deying , Deputy Director of the National Economic and Social Forecasting Center of Vietnam , said that , against the backdrop of turbulence in the world economy , Vietnam &apos;s economy will show high growth momentum in 2019 .
It is expected that by 2020 , Viet Nam &apos;s macro-economy will remain basically stable , the implementation of various free trade agreements will boost the development of trade , economic restructuring and improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened , and Viet Nam &apos;s external export activities will decline due to the impact of trade frictions .
Therefore , it is necessary to strengthen monitoring and early warning mechanisms , proactively seek trade relief measures for Viet Nam &apos;s export commodities , seek opportunities to develop new export markets , and facilitate the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products .
At the same time , inflation rates should be kept at reasonable levels , thereby promoting the development of complementary industries and supporting , inter alia , the development of high-technology agriculture , organic agriculture and agroecology .
Liu Zhijie , director of the Chinese Embassy &apos;s consular office in Siem Reap , held a reception in Siem Reap on Sunday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China .
Liu said that in the 70 years since the founding of New China , China has actively participated in international affairs , contributed more Chinese wisdom and programs to improve global economic governance and promote common global development , and made important contributions to world peace and development , as well as bringing tangible benefits to Cambodia &apos;s economic development and people &apos;s livelihood .
Liu said that as the world &apos;s second largest economy , China contributes more than 30 % to world economic growth , especially China &apos;s &quot; One Belt , One Road &quot; initiative , and cooperation between various Chinese provinces and municipalities and the provinces of Siem Reap and the region is deepening .
He said this year marks the opening of 61 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries , and that the mutually-beneficial cooperation between the two countries will become the driving force for local economic and social development .
The Governor of Siem Reap Province , Mr. Desha , highly commended the great achievements made by New China over the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on their friendly cooperation .
Desai Ha expects the two sides to continue to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation , enhance mutual trust and mutual benefit , and continuously improve people &apos;s living standards .
Disayha said the friendly exchanges between Siem Reap and Chinese provinces and municipalities have attracted attention . So far , Siem Reap has concluded friendly city relations with 28 Chinese provinces and municipalities , landed a large-scale cultural and performing arts project , Angkor Smile and Angkor Dynasty , Siem Reap - Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park , Siem Reap New International Airport Project , special training courses for government officials in Siem Reap , Siem Reap Scholarship to Study in China , village free consultation , urban renewal road , and the &quot; Bright and Bright Walk &quot; public benefit project for the rehabilitation of the cataract .
The reception was attended by the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia , Kang Wen-song ; the Chairman of the Siem Reap Provincial Council , Ong Heng ; the Governor of the Region 5 , the Siem Reap Branch of the Cambodia Council , volunteer teachers , representatives of the Siem Reap Branch of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia , representatives of Chinese enterprises and representatives of foreign tour leaders in Siem Reap .
Witness Digital China &apos;s Decade-long &quot; Cloud Rise &quot; in a Cloud Town - Xinhua
If the 2009 local website forum is taken as the starting point , the 2019 Cloud Congress in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 May has already passed a full decade .
From the concept of a &quot; cloud in a cloud &quot; to the practice of &quot; cloud on a cloud , &quot; Big Data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies underpinning China &apos;s economic development , social management , and public services in 10 years .
At Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery workshop in Haining , Zhejiang Province , a new &quot; colleague &quot; loaded with Ariyun &apos;s artificial intelligence was recently placed next to a quality inspector .
It has 24 hours of rest , identification speed is more than twice that of man , and the accuracy of quality inspection is stable at more than 95 % .
The company chief said the quality inspector , who has a camera , has focused on learning more than 40,000 defective samples , which , with the power of cloud computing behind them , can quickly convert infrared images into binary language and sort and place defective cells .
The company is only the epitome of the transformation of today &apos;s cloud computing power manufacturing industry .
In 2018 , the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology published the Guide for the Implementation of the Enterprise Cloud ( 2018 – 2020 ) , which states that by 2020 , enterprises should have a significantly higher awareness and motivation of the cloud and a significantly higher percentage of the cloud and the depth of application .
Today , data-centric cloud computing has built bridges and paved the way for the digital economy , where data is a key element , said Wang Jian , founder of Aricloud .
At the same time , in the past 10 years , the scale of China &apos;s cloud computing industry has been expanding .
According to the White Paper on the Development of Cloud Computing ( 2019 ) , released by the China Information and Communications Technology Research Institute in July , the overall market size of cloud computing in China in 2018 reached 96.28 billion yuan , up 39.2 % from 2017 .
In addition to being the key technology underpinning industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy , the invisible “ cloud ” has unwittingly transformed urban management and social life .
The city brain , unveiled three years in a row at this year &apos;s convention , is still drawing attention .
At present , the urban brain has been transformed from a transportation governance tool into a hub of urban management , and the cooperative application has been extended to 23 cities around the world .
Through camera awareness , AI algorithms , and urban brains , new city-management services such as “ travel-circuit design ” are enabled by powerful computational capabilities that allow “ parking first , paying later , ” “ seeing people in real time . ”
In the area of government services , &quot; one cloud &quot; docking &quot; one thing &quot; , &quot; handheld office &quot; &quot; hand in hand &quot; to promote the cooperation , cloud computing for government services to bring convenience to both ends of the supply .
Currently , Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform for the whole province through the cloud of government affairs .
As of September 11 , the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million corporate units in the province , with 19.08 billion data sets in 3066 categories of governance .
On average , 12 million calls a month have been made and shared between government departments in Zhejiang Province , and each additional call on the cloud may mean that people run fewer errands .
Beware of using plastic tea bags to make tea !
A recent Canadian study found that a bag of plastic tea could release billions , if not billions , of tiny plastic particles , significantly higher than a person &apos;s estimated annual intake of microplastics , but there is no evidence that ingesting small plastic particles poses a threat to humans .
Researchers at Canada &apos;s McGill University reportedly found that by immersing a plastic tea bag in a cup of almost boiling hot water ( 95 degrees Celsius ) , the tea bag releases about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup .
This amount is significantly higher than a person &apos;s estimated annual intake of microplastics .
According to research published earlier in 2019 , the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics .
Writing in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology , the researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal shops and cafes , opened them , washed them and dipped them in almost boiling water for five minutes , and analyzed them with electron microscopes and spectrometers .
According to the study , they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles , &quot; several orders of magnitude higher than the plastic charge of other food items . &quot;
Most tea bags are made from natural fibres , but many tea bag brands still use plastic to seal their mouths , the report said .
Some branded tea bags , which the researchers tested , have switched from paper to plastic .
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic that researchers define to be between 100 nm and 5 mm in size and produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste .
Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air , soil , rivers and the deepest trenches around the world , as well as in tap water , bottled water , seafood and beer .
Researchers first detected plastic particles in human feces samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018 .
To test the potential toxicity of the plastic particles released from tea bags , the Canadian research team placed daphnids in contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behaviour of these daphnids and caused them to develop deformities .
According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , there is no evidence to date that ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans .
However , the WHO noted that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what impact they have on humans .
The researchers speculate that the large amount of plastic particles released by the bags may be due to the fact that the bags are in contact with boiling water and may break down or exude toxic substances even when &quot; edible grade &quot; plastics are heated above 40 degrees Celsius .
Mr Guterres said the climate emergency was the biggest threat to the survival of small island states .
There , a natural disaster can erode the development gains of a generation .
This has been illustrated by the hurricanes that have struck Barbuda , Dominica and the Bahamas this year .
About a quarter of people in small island developing States live at altitudes of 5 metres or less .
Relocation could seriously affect their societies and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity .
At a summit on climate action on Monday , small island states worked together to achieve carbon-neutral 100 % renewable energy by 2030 , and they are once again leading the world in the right direction .
&quot; The climate crisis is piling up new injustices on top of the old ones , &quot; Guterres said .
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming , they pay the highest price .
Because of their middle-income status , many countries are also caught in an accelerating and unsustainable cycle of disasters and indebtedness .
The world must act , and now is the time to make big decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States , &quot; he said .
Today &apos;s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for finding ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks , invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and make the transition to renewable energy ; and urged international agencies to help small island developing States , especially highly indebted middle-income countries , access finance .
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving Earth ’ s lifeblood , the oceans .
The latest special report , released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , confirms that the oceans have suffered the dire consequences of the climate crisis .
By the middle of this century , many regions could experience extreme sea level rise every year that would have occurred only once in a century .
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation , some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable .
Pollution , overfishing and acidification have taken a huge toll .
In the past 150 years , the world has lost half of all living corals , while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years .
The demand from industry , shipping , mining and tourism is leading to a reduction in resources , including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities .
Small island States also face high costs of transport , energy and infrastructure .
They are heavily dependent on a number of external markets , which make them vulnerable to price fluctuations .
Some States are also making efforts to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons , arms and drugs .
&quot; By solving one problem in the most challenging circumstances , the problem can be solved anywhere , &quot; Guterres said .
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools , lessons learned and examples for the world to learn from . &quot;
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development .
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community .
India &apos;s finance ministry says the financial system is liquid .
Indian Finance Minister Sita Talaman 26 said the current financial system liquidity , driven by holiday consumer demand , India &apos;s economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of the fiscal year .
Seetharaman made the announcement after a meeting with representatives of India &apos;s private banks , non-bank financial institutions , housing banks and others .
Seitaraman did not specify the targeted nature of the remarks .
Earlier , some Indian and overseas media attributed the ongoing slowdown in India &apos;s economy to liquidity constraints at non-bank financial institutions .
Seetaraman took the decline in car sales as an example , denying that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline .
Seetaraman noted that the decline in car sales was mainly due to cyclical factors .
Mr Sitaraman expects India &apos;s economy to recover in the second half of the fiscal year , led by holiday spending .
India &apos;s annual shopping season begins in September and will last until the end of the year .
The market expects shopping spending to contribute significantly to India &apos;s economic growth .
The Jiangxi Provincial Education Department recently issued a notice to prohibit the entire province &apos;s primary and secondary schools during the National Day holiday to make up for violations of the law , and will organize personnel to carry out random unannounced visits .
In the &quot; Notice on the Strictly Prohibition of the Violation of the Long Holidays of National Day &quot; , the Jiangxi Provincial Education Department stressed that primary and secondary schools in all areas should resolutely do their part during the National Day holiday : No collective remedial classes or new classes should be organized , no discipline training courses , special classes , Osaiban classes , interest classes , promotion classes should be held , and no campus or school premises should be leased to other educational institutions to hold training courses of any kind .
At the same time , in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from organizing , recommending and inducing students to participate in remedial classes for in-service school violations , in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from participating in out-of-school training institutions or from organizing by other teachers , parents , parents &apos; committees , etc . , and in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from introducing the source of students and providing relevant information to out-of-school training institutions and others .
It is clear from the circular that in case of confirmed violations of the right to remedial lessons in primary and secondary schools , the local education administration department will increase the penalty points in the assessment of high-quality development education of the county government in that year ; teachers involved in the right to remedial lessons will be dealt with seriously in accordance with the relevant provisions on teacher ethics and style of work .

We should focus on the production and implementation of quality sows , conscientiously implement the subsidy policy for quality sows , encourage pig growing enterprises to expand the scale of pig breeding , and select excellent sows from commercial pig populations in a planned way .
We should do a good job of attracting investment and take the famous domestic large aquaculture enterprises which have not yet entered our province as the top priority of attracting investment .
We should do a good job of implementing the market circulation system , speed up the construction of cold chain logistics facilities for pigs , and promote the transformation from &quot; regulating pigs &quot; to &quot; regulating meat &quot; in an all-round way .
To ensure the implementation of the modern epidemic prevention system , all localities should provide basic quarantine personnel appropriate to the scale of cultivation and the task of work , and build a solid first line of defense against and control of epidemics .
Sui demands that all efforts be made to ensure meat market supply , to ensure that there is no large-scale shortage , wide range of supply , to ensure a stable pork market on major holidays .
The meeting also continued to grasp the African swine fever epidemic prevention and control , the important waters of the Yangtze River Basin in our province closed to fishing , the province as a whole , the acquisition of late rice , and so on .

“ Some of the over-age migrant workers on some sites are estimated to account for more than half . ”
Where to find young workers now ?
There is no other way than to use so many old people on the construction site .
Recently , there are many over-age migrant workers ( over the retirement age ) on the construction site , Zou Kui , who works as a construction contractor for many years , lamented .
Recently , the author of the university rain diversion project , the campus has a lot of migrant workers , if careful observation , will find that there are a lot of over-age migrant workers .
Over-age migrant workers are not “ idle , ” but “ idle , ” with the “ need to do so ” – whether saving for old age and medical care or helping out their children – driving these older people to continue their hard work .
Over-age migrant workers of &quot; old have some basis &quot; , not as easy as we think .
Raising children , supporting the elderly , reading for their children , helping them build a house and buy a car , helping them start a family and raise grandchildren from generation to generation . By the time these migrant workers have accomplished their “ life mission , ” the purse strings have been emptied and even there are many debts , most of them lacking in wealth accumulation .
In order not to drag the children also in order to accumulate more wealth for themselves , many migrant workers insist on &quot; until the time can not be dry . &quot;
The reluctance of many post-80 , post-90 and post-00 generations of new migrant workers to engage in difficult conditions , labour-intensive secondary industries or low-end service industries has created a structural “ labour shortage , ” with unattractive jobs providing opportunities for over-age migrant workers .
Owing to the lack of skills and the decline in physical functions and working capacity , many over-age rural migrant workers are engaged in jobs with high intensity , low incomes , high risks and low security .
Capable day is a day , can earn a little more is a little , &quot; can not idle &quot; behind the survival plight of over-age migrant workers , can not be ignored and ignored .
The solution to the problem of unpaid and salaried wages , improving labor protection , reducing safety risks , increasing labor income , and improving the survival of over-age migrant workers , in addition to their “ self-redemption , ” is also inseparable from institutional protection and humane care in the public sector .
Some scholars point out that over-age migrant workers are no longer likely to rely on home farming to solve their pension and medical problems , they have to provide for their families through other means .
It is helpful for us to better understand the love and pain of over-age migrant workers by reading their helplessness and steadfastness .
Seeing the backstory of over-age migrant workers , hearing their sighs , and finding ways to bring them back to the countryside to truly achieve “ old roots , ” requires shared responsibility and concerted efforts on the part of the public sector , the market , and society in a virtuous interaction .
He said Russia will not export the system in the next five years because it &quot; supplies its own troops first and will not export production until later .
This practice is fully in line with international practice .
Major producers of arms and military equipment always ensure their national defence needs first before processing export orders .
Earlier , the deputy commander of Russia &apos;s space forces , General Yuri Glekhov , had indicated that development of the system was nearing completion .
The S-500 system was developed by Diamond Antelope Aerospace Defense Consensual .
This is a new generation of air defence systems , using the working principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets .
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles capable of intercepting missiles with a range of up to 3,500 km .
In addition , according to some sources , the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft , almost all types of unmanned aircraft , hypersonic missiles more than five times the speed of sound , and even targets near space .
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems , in particular the S-400 system , which is important from a defence perspective .
Sergei Cemtsov expressed particular concern about the S-400 .
He said the system is now in great demand in the world , but it is also needed by the Russian military , including in the Arctic .
S-400 air defense systems in service with the Arctic Air Defense Regiment .
According to a news release on 15 September , work was completed on the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system of the Arctic Air Defense Regiment of Novaya Zemlya .
This is not Russia &apos;s militarization of the Arctic .
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense , this is entirely a process within the plan for transition to a more advanced defensive tool in the strategic direction to the north .
&quot; With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system , the controlled airspace in the Arctic region has significantly increased , &quot; the Russian Northern Fleet press service said .
Importantly , the use of the system in the Far North and Arctic has been successfully assessed by the military .
Members of the Air Defence Regiment were trained on the new system and prepared to enter combat duty .
Previously , it was equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system , which is still partially in place .
When it comes to air defense systems , they must have weapons capable of destroying all kinds of air targets , be it targets flying at high speeds in the outer layers or near &quot; leaky fish &quot; in protected facilities .
According to open sources , the S-400 &quot; Triumph &quot; system , developed by the Golden Diamonds Antelope Sky Defense Constellation , is designed for use against strategic and tactical aircraft , ballistic missiles , hypersonic targets , and other air attack weapons .
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets at a range of 400 km and shoot down ballistic targets at a distance of 60 km at 4.8 km / s .
Russia has made no secret of the fact that it will deploy additional anti-aircraft forces in the Far North to secure the airspace over the northern sea .
Not long ago , the first 12 sets of Tor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic , enough to form an anti-aircraft battalion to strengthen anti-aircraft systems in the Arctic .
The Russian Defense Ministry said at the time that the Arctic Thor force would be expanded to full brigade-size units in the future .
Coupled with the new S-400 long-range systems deployed to Novaya Zemlya and the Kola Peninsula , and the Pantsir-SA short-range system deployed in the Far North , these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are a powerful defense of Russia &apos;s polar skies .
Enemy planes , helicopters , and drone missiles will be hard to break through this defense .
According to the Russian government &apos;s thinking , the flagship store will be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods , avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores .
As a Russian store operator , Rosneft focuses on selling Russian goods in China .
Most Russian products are available online on China &apos;s largest trading platforms , such as Tmall , JD , 1688 , Pinduoduo , ShouQ , WeChat , as well as its own online platform , Epinduo.com , and the Russian retail chain of goods .
The Russian export centre will work with Rosneft to develop store marketing strategies and engagement criteria , as well as screening companies for products on virtual shelves .
The store plans to open by the end of this year and stock the products of at least 10 Russian manufacturers .
According to the Russian Export Center , the total number of monthly visits to the platform from China is 1 billion .
Meanwhile , food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014 , surpassing $ 1 billion in 2018 .
For now , Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores selling goods from New Zealand , Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of a global import strategy .
The new store will display goods from businesses with sales of at least 500 million rubles , according to Alexei Korzevnikov .
To be honest , my expectations were higher , and sales of 500 million roubles were not even close .
We all know that Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods and regard our goods as high quality and green products .
The competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying , Kolesnikov said .
&quot; We have an ambitious target to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years , &quot; he said .
At the same time , the platform also hosted the products of enterprises in the Russian Far East .
&quot; This is a political project that represents the image of both sides , because the Russian export center is a state-owned , not a private institution , &quot; said Vyacheslav Cheglov , a professor in the Department of the Foundation of Trade Policy at Russia &apos;s Plekhanov University of Economics .
&quot; I don &apos;t see a lot of highly competitive Russian goods on the market . &quot;
He believed that the project would probably not be truly implemented , but would help to strengthen relations between the two countries .
Andrey Slepnev , president of the Russian Export Center , said during the Eastern Economic Forum that information on the products of more than 170 Russian companies had been published on Alibaba.com , the largest international wholesale online platform , and could be purchased in China or other countries .
There is also a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group , a training programme for Russian companies by experts from Taobao University , whose first seminar was held in July this year .
The Russian export center will also serve as an organizer for Russian enterprises participating in trade exhibitions and commercial projects at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November .
A large-scale exhibition will be held in the 1,000-square-meter exhibition hall , which will also serve as a hub for business project activities , signing ceremonies , presentations and talks with representatives of Chinese companies .
About 50 applications from Russian agribusiness have been received so far .
&quot; In addition to the agricultural exhibition stands , we will certainly hold business meetings , that is , arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs , &quot; the Russian Export Centre News Service said .
&quot; This is another direction of our efforts to support the business and ensure that dozens of dedicated meetings are arranged for it , &quot; the statement said .
The expo will also feature masterclasses , culinary competitions and a tasting of Russian cuisine by renowned chefs from the Discovery of Russian Food Shanghai Station project .
Police await a full report and instructions from the Attorney General &apos;s Office to take their next steps after a verdict of non-accidental death was handed down by the coroner &apos;s court on Friday .
In a statement on Friday , the National Police Criminal Investigation Bureau ( NCPCID ) , acting on the verdict of the Coroner &apos;s Court , said police would await further instructions from the Attorney General &apos;s Office .
In his statement , he stressed that police have never terminated their investigation into the killing of Mohamud while the investigation is ongoing .
On the other hand , Syracuse Police Chief Nora Zhan said police will wait for a full report on the contents of the ruling before taking action .
He was asked about the incident Friday morning at the Syracuse Police Headquarters after attending the handover ceremony for Syracuse &apos;s deputy chief of police .
He said police were investigating the case based on relevant reports .
He added that the police would also look at the progress of the investigation and decide whether to call back those who had previously taken statements .

Xinhua comment : Unswervingly take our own path
The answer lies in the fact that , under the leadership of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , the Chinese people have found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and are firmly following it .
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people for China to take the road of development that suits it .
In modern times , in the poor and weak , internal and external disaster environment , generations of benevolent people to search for the way to save the country and save the people , after the search .
However , &quot; the constitutional monarchy , the restoration of the monarchy , the parliamentary system , the multiparty system , the presidential system have all thought about it , tried it , and it has not worked . &quot;
It was only with the Communist Party of China and New China that the Chinese people gradually blazed a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice .
The road taken by China is a road of happiness for the Chinese people , a road to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , and a road of common development between China and the rest of the world .
It is because China is on the right path that it is able to do its job well , become the world &apos;s second largest economy , contribute most to global economic growth , and continuously benefit the world with its own development .
As the white paper points out , this road of China &apos;s development is in line with China &apos;s national conditions and meeting the requirements of the times , and will show more and more bright prospects as the times progress .
Looking back , the Chinese people are keenly aware of how difficult it is to find the right road ; looking around the world , the Chinese people cherish this right road all the more .
Chinese people understand the truth of southern orange northern bribe , understand that what suits others is not necessarily for themselves , only for their own is the best .
It is with this kind of confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle that has attracted worldwide attention .
In the twists and turns of mankind &apos;s advance , &quot; the end of history &quot; has been a famous conclusion for a while .
Today , the success of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics heralds the end of the &quot; end of history , &quot; the collapse of the &quot; collapse of China , &quot; and the failure of the &quot; socialist failure theory . &quot;
China &apos;s success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve national wealth and strong people , expanded the ways for developing countries to modernize , and provided lessons for those countries and nations in the world that wish to accelerate their development and maintain their independence to follow a path suited to their national conditions .
The world is colourful .
China has always respected the right of each country to choose the road of development that suits its own conditions .
Instead of &quot; importing &quot; the foreign model and &quot; exporting &quot; the Chinese model.Instead , China will unswervingly follow its own path , achieve its own continuous development , strengthen exchanges with other countries in the administration of state affairs , and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance and good governance .
A Foodworks supermarket boss who sacked a 66-year-old female worker via text message because he preferred to hire staff from an Asian background has been slammed as &quot; disgraceful &quot; by the Fair Work Commission .
The council said the way in which Gail Ayton , owner of the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years , treated staff was &quot; grossly unfair &quot; and may have breached anti-discrimination laws .
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr Wang , who took over the shop in 2016 , had been &quot; trying to fire me &quot; because she was not Chinese .
In the case , the commission &apos;s vice-chairman , Peter Sams , conducted an internet search and found &quot; a number of job advertisements that Mr Wang had published in the past at various Australian Chinese employment forums . &quot;
Among the job requirements listed in the posts , one said &quot; preferred Asian woman &quot; and the other said &quot; preferred Asian employee . &quot;
A third post said he was &quot; more inclined to go overseas &#91; sic &#93; . &quot;
Mr Wang sacked Ms Ayton in April this year via text message , later claiming it was due to her absence from work and a small amount of cash missing from the cash register allegedly between $ 5.10 and $ 30 .
But Mr Sams said Mr Wang &apos;s reasons for dismissing Ms Ayton were weak and lacking in evidence .
She had been absent from only one shift for three years , missing payments totalling a few dollars .
He said Ms Ayton &apos;s dismissal &quot; actually had nothing to do with her conduct or performance . &quot;
&quot; It seems to me that the real motive for the candidate to fire her , supported by the evidence of the job advertisement released by Mr. Wang , was that he preferred to hire people with an Asian background , &quot; he said .
Under section 772 ( f ) of the Fair Work Act , Mr Wang &apos;s conduct ostensibly constitutes a breach of anti-discrimination law and / or dismissal of an applicant is unlawful , &quot; the statement read .
Mr Sams said it would be inappropriate for him to consider reinstating Ms Ayton in view of Mr Wang &apos;s &quot; appalling &quot; treatment of her .
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton , who is a casual labourer on an hourly rate of A $ 26 .
In light of possible violations of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation , Mr Sams said he would refer his own findings and documents to the commission director to consider whether Mr Wang &apos;s conduct should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible breaches of state or federal law .
He said Mr Wang had not given Ms Ayton any opportunity to respond to the reasons for allegedly sacking her .
&quot; I believe that the respondent engaged in an irredeemably unfair and biased process to dismiss the applicant , and that Mr. Wang was &quot; waiting &quot; for this opportunity , which he believed would &quot; justify &quot; the termination of the applicant &apos;s employment , &quot; he said .
&quot; He was wrong ... in dismissing the applicant in complete disregard of any natural justice accorded her , and it is appalling that he acted in such a perfunctory manner as to be disrespectful and grossly unfair . &quot;
Mr Sams said that while Foodworks was a small business , &quot; it is important to state frankly that no decent employer would dismiss an employee in a way that was recognised in this case as extremely unfair and perfunctory . &quot;
&quot; It is shameful and it is extremely unfair , &quot; he said .

6 persons denied being involved in the sale of counterfeit magma paper paper case referred to a higher court
Six men , including an assistant director of the country &apos;s name registration bureau and a trader at the rank of Dato &apos; tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai-tai
One of the defendants , Li Zhenhua , a lawyer representing the Chinese defendants in the case and a member of the Legislative Assembly of Sunset Dong District , applied to the judge to withdraw from the case and cease to be the defendant &apos;s representative , which was granted in court .
He stated that he had attracted criticism from political opponents on behalf of the accused and that his own DAP party had also been implicated .
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threat , but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to smear the PAP and the Greek League government or other Greek League leaders , so the decision was taken only after careful consideration .
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between representing the defendants and being a member of the National Assembly , and that there was no legal prohibition on him representing any of the defendants , and so far , the defendant , Mr Lai Chun-wah , had not been convicted .
The six defendants went to court on 12 September this year . They were all charged under sections 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Ordinance and 466 of the Criminal Code ( forgery of documents ) .
On Thursday , the two magistrates , Nossaha and Mazlan , granted the prosecution &apos;s application to have the charges against the six defendants transferred to a higher court , after the prosecution &apos;s arguments , and the charges of forgery of documents to await the transfer of documents by the prosecution to the defence , to be heard on 3 October .
The six defendants had earlier been arrested under the National Security Offences ( Special Measures ) Order 2012 ( SOSMA ) and were therefore not released on bail by the judge .

Vietnam needs to seize the opportunity to develop artificial intelligence .
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities ’ readiness to face an AI wave include outlook , capacity to achieve , asset base , and direction of development .
Singapore City ranked first , followed by cities in countries including the UK , the US , France , Sweden , the Netherlands , Germany and Australia .
In response to an interview with reporters , Oliver Wyman , an expert on Oliver Wyman , said , &quot; I think it makes a lot of sense to look back and assess cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City .
On the whole , I think Vietnam &apos;s future is bright against the backdrop of a high growth rate , a strong economic development path and a rapidly growing talent base .
I think Vietnam is on the right path and doing well .
It is important for Vietnam to know how to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to further develop its economy . &quot;
Artificial intelligence is revolutionising the way people work , communicate and live .
It brings greater efficiency , but it also threatens to exacerbate social , economic and technological inequalities .
However , according to a global study organised by Oliver Wyman , only any city in the world today is prepared for a breakthrough in the age of artificial intelligence .

The buyback scale of listed companies reached a record high of more than $ 100 billion during the year .
In order to stabilize the company &apos;s share price and maintain the company &apos;s image , listed companies have begun to buy back shares frequently over the past two years , hoping to relay the information that the company is undervalued to the market by way of targeted buybacks , collective price trading , etc . , thus stabilizing the stock price and enhancing investor confidence .
According to the Eastern Wealth Choices data , in 2017 , the company spent 7.9 billion yuan on share repurchases , which jumped to 51 billion yuan in 2018 , and since 2019 , the company has implemented 100 billion yuan in share repurchases , which is a record high amount of capital repurchases and far higher than in previous years .
From the point of view of the repurchase , the company repurchase shares and the majority shareholder increase appear the same , but in the implementation of the main body , the source of funds , the use of repurchase , the equity of the stock itself , and so on .
In an interview with the Securities Daily , Xu Yang , chairman of Michael Rong Information Consulting LLC in Shanghai , said that the &quot; Opinions on Support for the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies &quot; , which was launched in November 2018 , had remedied the problems of the existing system , such as the narrow scope of share repurchase , complicated decision-making procedures and poor inventory system .
In January this year , the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges formally issued the Rules for the Implementation of the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies , which broaden the sources of funding for the buyback of listed companies , properly simplify the implementation procedures , guide the improvement of governance arrangements , and encourage various listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans .
After the opinion comes out , the listed company carries out the operation of share repurchase , has more applicable circumstance , the repurchase process is more simple , share repurchase is more motivated .
Buying back shares in a relatively low location also helps listed companies to use their capital more efficiently , thereby increasing earnings per share , raising net asset yields and easing pressure on corporate earnings metrics .
Compared with the increase of large shareholders , the buyback of shares of listed companies is more significant , which also reflects the active market value management of listed companies and abundant cash flow .
According to Xu , the undervaluation of stock prices is a major factor in the buyback of listed companies , whose stock prices no longer reflect the future prospects of the company , such companies deserve the attention of investors , but do not blindly invest , need to pay attention to the financial performance of such listed companies and specific operations .
Listed companies with large-scale repo behavior , at least the development of confidence and financial strength of the company .
The buy-back of A-share listed companies has become more and more popular , with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented share buybacks this year , and that the leading companies in the various sectors have become the mainstay of the repo market .
China Ping An recently disclosed the progress of the buyback , saying that the company had accumulated 5.759 million shares of A shares , or 0.315 % of the company &apos;s total equity , through a centralized bidding transaction , and had paid out a total of 5 billion yuan ( excluding transaction fees ) in total , and that the repurchase would be entirely spent on employee stock ownership plans , including but not limited to the long-term service plans already considered by the company &apos;s shareholders &apos; meeting .
Yili has paid 57.92 billion yuan for the share repurchase , and recently adjusted the purpose of the share repurchase , changing the original plan from &quot; share repurchase will be used exclusively as a source of stock for later implementation of equity incentives &quot; to &quot; cumulative share repurchase of 183 million shares , of which 152 million shares will be used as a source of equity incentives , and the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used for cancellation to reduce registered capital &quot; .
Yili shares said that some of the repurchased shares will be written off , in order to further raise the level of earnings per share , the company &apos;s shareholders to effectively enhance the return on investment .
According to TCL &apos;s progress announcement on September 25 , TCL will repurchase 3.59 % of the company &apos;s shares at a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan .
The repurchase will be used for employee stock ownership plans , equity incentives or to convert convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies , the TCL Group &apos;s board office told the Securities Daily .
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy , constantly improving competitiveness and sustaining healthy development .
Based on confidence in the future development of the company and protection of investors &apos; interests , combining with the performance of the secondary market for nearly a year , and taking into account such factors as the company &apos;s operating and financial status , the company plans to repurchase the company &apos;s shares using its own capital , self-financing and other methods of financing .
Yang Delong , chief economist at the former Hai Open Source Fund , said the buyback of shares by listed companies , which reduces the number of shares in circulation and increases the earnings per share of listed companies , is an important positive for secondary market share prices , and the willingness of listed companies to pay real money to buy back shares from the stock market , which greatly boosts market confidence .
The buyback of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years , particularly of merit shares , and boosting investor confidence through share buybacks is a very good way to do that , and one that deserves recognition and encouragement .
Hu Henghua , Standing Committee Member of the Hunan Provincial Committee and Secretary of the Communist Party of Changsha , and the four main leaders of Xiang Jun , Zhan Zhen , Liang Xiangnan , He Qinghua and Liu Fei Xiang , set a &quot; small goal &quot; around &quot; Changsha from construction machinery to intelligent manufacturing &quot; , and in three to five years established a world-leading engineering machinery industry cluster .
In Changsha to build the world &apos;s leading level of construction machinery industry cluster , in the words of the now fashionable , is to create &quot; the strongest surface . &quot;
As an inland capital city , Changsha calls out this rhetoric , where is the bottom line ?
It is based on the strength of the overbearing side leakage .
The four construction machinery Xiangsheng enterprises , each with his own hands , cover the whole field of sky , underground , sea and land : light aircraft with intelligence of mountain and river , concrete conveyor pump of CITIC , all-ground crane of Trinity Heavy Work , tunnel shield machine of heavy work of iron construction .
Once upon a time , China had little say in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing .
The time is easy , Chinese enterprises &quot; imported &quot; &quot; go out &quot; two-wheel drive , take the &quot; one belt , one road &quot; initiative east wind , acquisition , merger , plant , such as a number of measures , has become the world &apos;s leading engineering machinery industry .
Among them , the leading construction machinery enterprises , such as the Trinity Heavy Industries , the Central Union Heavy Industries , the Iron Construction Heavy Industries and the Shan River Intelligence , have led the way in terms of output value , market share and sales , among other major economic indicators .
It is the power of the moment that moves by chance .
Construction Machinery Xiangjun &quot; four King Gang &quot; , Changsha construction machinery industry cluster is the best of the head of the global construction machinery industry enterprises .
In the rivers and lakes of the global industry , who lives and does well is the hard place to speak .
In the early years , the global engineering machinery industry suffered a cold winter , a number of internationally renowned engineering machinery manufacturers have fallen down , but Changsha &apos;s engineering machinery manufacturers as &quot; winter swimming &quot; , self-pressure , self-breakthrough , through the industrial structure transition from manufacturing to intellectual-building , not only the past , but also more robust body .
It is the power of government and enterprise that is won by all the stars .
The development of the superior industry needs not only the enterprise to be enterprising , but also the government to be active .
Changsha has the reputation of being the &quot; capital of construction machinery &quot; because it brings together the whole industrial chain from upstream to downstream , creating many related industrial clusters , and by optimizing the business environment , improving supporting services and simplifying approval process , the research and development , manufacturing and sales costs of enterprises have been greatly reduced .
Good business ecology , let the engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises come in .
History has pushed Changsha to the front of the world &apos;s leading level of construction machinery , when the time has come , when the benevolent .
Whether the government , enterprises , or even the relevant enterprises , researchers and researchers should seize the opportunity to make a lasting contribution to the building of a powerful nation .
Wang Yi presides over the Foreign Ministers &apos; meeting of China and the African member states of the UN Security Council .

Gansu Qingyang : Lake sheep pack to &quot; get rid of poverty . &quot;
Autumn in September rendered the Loess Plateau .
A 58-year-old villager from Yongma Township &apos;s Yimin Farm Cooperative put a last shovelful of grass into the trough and watched the white lake sheep munch on the trough .
&quot; Good to eat , until autumn and winter are full of fat , out of the column to sell a good price . &quot;
Mr. Heaveli says he feeds the sheep a &apos; special diet &apos; every day , with regular cleaning and sterilization and meticulous attention .
Haveli kept sheep for more than 20 years until she came to work in a cooperative and learned how extensive sheep herding used to be .
Xiaveli is a resident of Qingcheng County , Gansu Province .
His neighbors are sheep farmers , but adhere to the traditional way of scattering sheep , poor quality sheep , small amount of column .
In June this year , under the guidance of the government , 140 poor families in the village joined the cooperative and everything started to change .
Haveli was immersed in farming all day long , because he always had a strong hold on his heart .
All of them were poor families , and they kept the sheep in trust with the cooperative , counting on him whether they could pay dividends or sell them at the end of the year .
Fortunately , with the guidance of technicians , he slowly learned to do epidemic prevention , mastered scientific feeding , became a small number of the village breeding &quot; good &quot; style .
It is a standardised cooperative , with 16 sheds and approximately 1400 sheep in the lake .
Zou Tao , co-director of the cooperative , said the standardized sheep shed inside and outside , are very accessible .
The wool is thick , it breeds germs easily , the lake sheep cannot be kept in a stuffy , damp place , the shed must be built in a three-sided groove , and a fan must be installed to ventilate and dissipate heat .
Zou Tao said , in order to prevent epidemic , also need to regularly spray and disinfect sheep shed , giving sheep three or four anti-epidemic needles a season .
&quot; Little Sheep &quot; not only live well , but also eat a mixture of silage corn , wheat grass , clover , and so on , and have a wide enough &quot; playground &quot; stretch bones .
Cooperative societies adopt custodianship in place of breeding , and guide local farmers to place well-bred lagoon sheep here , raising , managing and selling them in a unified way , so as to achieve improved , scientific , standardized and intensive breeding .
Today , the sheep ownership of 140 poor households , each household bonus of more than 6,000 yuan , there are four set up in the cooperative work .
In Qingyang , Gansu Province , the cultivation of meat and sheep is more than just a change of feeding pattern . The pattern of &quot; leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers &quot; has changed the image of the former &quot; sheep raising on the hillside , selling sheep in fairs &quot; , overcoming the weakness of traditional farming and animal husbandry and making poor farmers better because of modern sheep farming .
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak , local leading enterprise Zhongsheng Agropastoral Development Co . , Ltd . , will buy it at a protected market price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risk .
Xu Jianfeng , general adviser of Zhongsheng Agropastoral Development Co . Ltd . , in Gansu , said the company is helping more and more poor households to read the Sutra by providing loan guarantees , sheep farming supplies , order farming , quotation buying and unified processing and selling services .
In Qingyang , at least 8,200 poor families achieved a steady increase in income by “ joining ” the middle farming and pasture farming , fine seed breeding , large-scale farming , slaughter segmentation , and marketing .
Qingyang city is located in the northern farming and pastoral interlaced zone , forage is rich in resources .
At present , the city has 913 meat-sheep large-scale farming farms , cooperatives , meat sheep farming more than 5 million , and two 1.3 million slaughter-scale meat sheep processing production lines , sheep is becoming the industry poverty relief &quot; lead sheep .
The French finance minister said he would cut taxes by more than € 10 billion next year and called on Germany to follow suit
Paris ( Reuters ) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ( $ 10.9 billion ) next year and Germany should keep pace with France &apos;s fiscal stimulus to revive a sluggish economy , Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday .
Introducing France &apos;s 2020 budget , Le Maire said the ECB &apos;s latest monetary easing had created an opportunity for governments that could afford it to increase investment .
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to record lows on September 12 and plans to restart borrowing in an effort to drive down borrowing costs in hopes of stimulating economic recovery and pushing up inflation .
&quot; Low interest rates will not bring about a return to prosperity in Europe , and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient , &quot; Mr Le Maire told reporters .
&quot; Germany needs to invest now , and the sooner the better . Don &apos;t wait for things to get worse , &quot; he added .
He has made this appeal to Germany on a number of occasions .
France has already implemented more than € 10 billion in tax cuts this year , a big boost to its economic growth .
And the global economy has lost momentum , with the export-dependent German economy bearing the brunt .
Le Maire points out that the tax burden on French families will be reduced by € 9.3 billion next year , including € 5 billion in income tax relief .
In addition , the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost € 1 billion as the company tax rate is phased in over a five-year period , from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent .

Study : U.S. National Healthy Eating Index slightly up but still challenging - Zhongxin
A recent study showed a modest increase in the U.S. government &apos;s healthy eating index from 56 to 58 over the past 16 years .
But with a full score of 100 , it &apos;s hardly cause for celebration .
Americans still face &quot; significant challenges &quot; in their diets .
Dr. Fang Zhang , one of the study &apos;s co-authors and a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts , said Americans continue to eat a disproportionate amount of foods that can cause heart disease , diabetes and obesity , the most common diseases among Americans .
The study was published online April 24 in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
The study was based on findings from a U.S. government health survey of 44,000 adults conducted between 1999 and 2016 .
&quot; Despite considerable improvements , significant dietary challenges remain , &quot; the authors wrote .
The challenges are known to include getting Americans to cut down on snacks , hot dogs , fat cattle , butter and other foods that contain saturated fat .
The study found that people &apos;s dietary intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5 % to 12 % , exceeding the recommended intake limit of 10 % .
The biggest improvement in the national diet was a drop in sugar intake from 16 % to about 14 % , but it was still too high .
Officials say the intake of added sugar in the diet should be less than 10 % .
The researchers attributed the decrease in sugar consumption to a reduction in people &apos;s consumption of sugar-flavored soft drinks , but Zhang stressed that sugars are often added to even less-sweet foods , such as yoghurt and ketchup .
Adults in the United States have seen a small increase in their diets of fruits , nuts , oats and other whole grains .
However , 2016 data show that these foods still account for less than 5 % of the daily diet .
Although people consume slightly less salt , and the reduction in fruit juice has led to lower quality carbohydrates , Zhang said they still account for as much as 42 % of daily calories , many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains .
The study was based on biennial personal health surveys that asked adults to recall what they had eaten in the past 24 hours .
These health surveys have asked this question twice every few days since 2003 .
The government &apos;s Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend adopting a &quot; healthy eating pattern &quot; to reduce the risk of chronic disease .
The guidelines state that people should eat more nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables , fruits , whole grains , low-fat dairy products , as well as seafood , lean meats , poultry meat , eggs , seed-based foods that can provide protein .
The number of Americans with diabetes nearly doubled , to more than 7 % , during the study period , and obesity rates have increased over the years – today , about 70 % of American adults are overweight or obese .
In addition , heart disease remains the leading cause of death for U.S. nationals .

&quot; Alternative big data , such as telemarketers , spatio-temporal data , can help us better characterize the activity and prosperity of a region , an industry , &quot; he said .
In addition to mitigating risks , big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities , Zhang said .
China &apos;s deepest rail tunnel shaft refits
China News Agency Baoshan , September 27 ( Zhang Weiming Xu for the State of Zhou Jingbo ) after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction , the Dawei ( Li ) Rui ( Li ) Railway Gaoligongshan Tunnel No. 1 shaft completed construction on the 27th , at the depth of 762.59 meters below the surface , breaking the China Railway Tunnel shaft shaft , which is the deepest record , and this record is created by a large amount of water rush .
The 34.5 km long Daligongshan Tunnel is located in Yunnan , and is the longest single-tunnel tunnel in Asia , crossing the Gaoligongshan Mountains from the western bank of the Nujiang River .
The tunnel traverses 19 fault zones , with a maximum depth of 1,155 metres ( 3,430 ft ) , and is known as the &quot; Geology Museum &quot; of the tunnel construction because it covers almost all of the geological hazards and major risks that would be encountered in the construction of the tunnel .
The shaft is the most important auxiliary tunnel of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel , which is charged with the important task of increasing the operating surface to realize the &quot; short tunnel &quot; and the late railway operation ventilation .
The number 1 shaft was successfully dug to the bottom of the well , marking the formal entry of the Gaoligongshan Tunnel into the horizontal tunnel construction .
&quot; The shaft is all in the granite formation , because granite formation crevasses are more , can not stop the water , from the top to the bottom flow , basically as deep as the water pressure well . &quot;
Dai Jingzhao , Chief Engineer of the Dali Railway Project Department of China Railway Tunnel Bureau , told reporters that the shaft construction , many times occurred , such as muddy rush water , collapse , the construction side invited experts to the scene of the pulse , more than 20 to discuss the treatment plan .
&quot; At its maximum , the pressure of water in the shaft is equal to more than 300 cubic metres per hour , at a depth of more than 700 metres at the bottom of the well . &quot;
&quot; If we don &apos;t drain the water in time , we will drown 10 meters in one hour , &quot; he said . &quot; We spend almost 85 percent of our time on water treatment and 15 percent of our time on digging . &quot;
In order to overcome such geologic problems as longitudinal joint development , water inrush , water-rich granite , etc . , the tunnel construction adopts the combination of exploration , injection and excavation to reduce the risk of construction .
After many improvements , the construction of shaft No. 1 has formed a mechanized pipeline , such as excavation system , ballast system , hoist system , winch lifting system , etc . , and has realized the mechanization of the whole process , such as drilling , blasting , ballast , template installation , concrete pouring , etc . , thus accelerating the construction progress .
Eventually , after more than 1200 days of day and night construction , the shaft was successfully completed at a depth of 762.59 m .
With a length of 330 km , it is an important part of the international corridor between China and Myanmar and is an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the Belt and Road project .
When opened , the travel time from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from the current six hours to two hours , which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in western Yunnan and promote economic and trade cooperation and people-to-people friendly exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries .

Since its return to the motherland , Hong Kong has been closely linked with the Mainland , working hand in hand to share fruitful results .
We believe that under the premise of &quot; One Country , Two Systems &quot; , Hong Kong can continue to play its strengths and seize the opportunities of the &quot; Belt and Road &quot; and the &quot; Guangdong , Hong Kong and Macau &quot; areas to seek a better future for Hong Kong .
She added that every Hong Kong person had been affected by the social controversies of the past few months , and journalists had faced different challenges .
At this critical juncture , I hope our friends in the press will continue to rise to the challenge , act with professionalism , provide fair and balanced news coverage to the community , and contribute to the future of Hong Kong and the community &apos;s return to a rational dialogue .
In his speech , Jiang said that the glorious journey that the new China has gone through is also a journey of Hong Kong and the motherland living side by side in development , common progress , unity of blood and common prosperity .
Especially since Hong Kong &apos;s return to the motherland , the central government has unswervingly implemented the principles of &quot; one country , two systems &quot; , &quot; Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong &quot; and a high degree of autonomy .
To this end , the Hong Kong press gathered to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People &apos;s Republic of China .
He said Hong Kong had witnessed a series of violent activities in the past three months which blatantly violated the law and undermined social stability .
He called on the media to be turbid and create an atmosphere in which all people would resist violence and uphold the rule of law .
The professional media should strictly abide by the professional standards of journalism , use truthful reporting and responsible speech to guide the public to become more conscious of violence , and safeguard the justice and majesty of the law .

According to Wang Shengbin , Vice Minister of Publicity of the Xining Municipal Committee and Director of the Municipal Civilization Office , Xining City was awarded the title of National Civilization City in 2017 .
However , such uncivilized behaviors as crossing the street , running red lights , passing non-motorized vehicles without following traffic lights , throwing parabolas or windows , smoking in public places , walking dogs in public places and allowing people to urinate and defecate wherever they go are still prominent and easy to rebound , and need to be addressed as soon as possible .
In accordance with the reality of Xining , the regulations set out a more comprehensive and higher standard of civilized conduct for individuals and units in terms of public places , public order , public facilities , public environmental sanitation , civilized travel , civilized tourism , civilized Internet access , construction of civilized campuses , promotion of civilized family construction , performance of official duties , commemoration of heroes and martyrs , medical services , etc . , so as to make the whole society understand &quot; what can be done &quot; , &quot; what can be advocated &quot; and &quot; what is prohibited &quot; .
&quot; The enactment of regulations to eliminate blind spots and misconceptions in the field of civilized behavior perception , and to establish comprehensive standards for citizens &apos; behavior , housekeeping , dining , travel , education , tourism , Internet access , green life , wedding sacrifice , etc . , will provide a strong legal guarantee for the regularization of the creation of mass spiritual civilization in Xining City . &quot;

In particular , to catch up with the &quot; National Day &quot; holiday , more time , people are more willing to travel and consumption , which can meet the spiritual level of consumption needs , but also reflect the upgrading of residential consumption .
The afternoon began lonely , unwilling to go out , have not adjusted to the state of children not around .
Pick yourself up and say to Nana : Mom , take you out the door .
I have written down a few things to do in detail . The character of Type A blood is getting stronger and stronger , and I feel very uncomfortable .
Take a suit , buy a nutrition grain , pay , buy sashimi , Nana &apos;s snacks .
These are the reasons for going out .
In the end , it is revealed that he has no other choice but to go to the bar to buy a snack .
There was a few perfunctory chuckles , said the child came to the phone and hung up .
Nana leapt into the assistant seat , lying down on her back , knowing that she was carsick , terrified , and unwilling not to accompany me .
It was rare for Boo , her husband , to return early .
Lien marveled at the salmon salad with shea butter and went to his bedroom to lie in bed watching TV .
At a glance at the wall , just 7 o &apos;clock , Sunrise country sunset early , it has been dark down .
In the circle of friends in the invention of the moon , it turns out that today is the Mid-Autumn Festival .
Wash a bunch of grapes sent by friends , leave half for Boo , the rest will be put in the bowl of small flowers like , go out to see the moon .
Sitting on the ground with Nana , I eat the grapes . She eats the skins , and I spit the grapes far away .
The moon was hidden in the clouds , but when the clouds were gone , the moon appeared suddenly and faintly .
There is a lot of poetry about the moon in my head , but I just like it clearly . Every three or five years , I get together .
Perhaps we have given too much emotion to the moonlight , but for me it is best to say that it belongs to God , that Caesar belongs to Caesar .
The moonlight comes to you , the emotion comes to you .
After eating the grapes , it was cold in the cold moon .
Nana began to snore slightly at her feet . She stood up and spread Nana &apos;s blanket on the edge of her little house , on which Nana lay happily .
Pull the door open and yell , Is the bathwater ready
From the bathroom window is not to see the moon , only feel the moonlight , turn off the bathroom lights , open the glass .
No mooncakes , no drinking .

Does MCA contest the by-election in Dandui Bie , Johor ?
Mahua general secretary Dato &apos; Sri Wei Jiaxiang : &quot; Deliberate to the supreme council of the BN ! &quot;
The Dandong by-election was imminent , and concerns were raised about the traditional presence of a BN member , Ma Hua , in the seat .
However , after a meeting of the MCA Central Committee , it was announced that it would be left to the BN Supreme Council to decide whether the traditional MCA seat would remain with the MCA or be replaced by another MCA member party .
After chairing a meeting of the MCA Central Committee on Thursday afternoon , Wei told the media that any by-election would be conducted by the BN in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures ( SOP ) , that is , after a meeting through the BN Supreme Council .
He said that the meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front was expected to take place in early October , as the Electoral Commission would meet only on Monday ( 1 January ) to finalize the by-election for the seat of Denverbi .
&quot; Yesterday morning , I also met with the Chairman of the BN , Dato &apos; Shri Ahmad Zahi , and we all agreed on the need to regain the seat from the coalition of hope , &quot; he said .
&quot; We have finalized the convening of a special BN leadership conference in early October , at which the head of the three BN parties will determine which of their members will join the coalition . &quot;
When asked whether MCA would insist on standing for the traditional seat on the BN Supreme Council , Wei reiterated that as the head of the MCA , he must act in accordance with the standard operating procedures and therefore any decision must be agreed by the BN .
&quot; In any by-election , there are people willing to go out and there are political parties and there are parties that think they should come out , which is a common thing . &quot;
&quot; The most important thing is what kind of organization and political union are we from ? &quot;
&quot; This is a great test of our political union over the years , and we believe that the BN has held some valuable values along the way . &quot;
&quot; In the process , there may be someone who will say something , and that &apos;s not surprising , &quot; said the source .
&quot; But once the supreme council of the BN has made a decision , everyone must be prepared to fight , and that is the most valuable thing . &quot;
In any case , Mr Wei said , Ma would make every effort to prepare for the upcoming by-election at three levels , namely , District Council , State Council and Central .
&quot; The district council will be headed by the chairman of the district council , Dato &apos; Seri Huang , while the state council will be headed by the acting chairman of the Johor council , Dato &apos; Lin Peixing , and the central committee will be headed by the acting president , Dato &apos; Ma Hanshun , and the general secretary , Dato &apos; Zhang Shengyan . &quot;
On Saturday ( 21 July ) , a member of Parliament , Dato &apos; Mohd Faria , died of heart problems at the Government Hospital in Sinn Féin at the age of 42 .
A villager in Baokang County , Hubei Province , who hunted and captured wild animals has been ordered to &quot; patrol the mountain on a voluntary basis &quot;
A villager in Baokang County , Hubei Province , was sentenced for hunting and catching wildlife and ordered to pay compensation of 15,420 yuan ( RMB , same below ) for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources .
Due to the indigence of the family of the defendant , the procuratorial organs used alternative labor to compensate the ecological rehabilitation costs , thus realizing the organic unity of legal and social effects .
According to Wang Zhongliang , the deputy prosecutor general of Baokang County , Zhou had developed deep affection with wild macaques through three months of &quot; voluntary mountain patrol &quot; and was deeply responsible for hunting animals .
On June 21 this year , Baokang county procuratorate filed a criminal incidental civil public interest lawsuit in the field of ecological resources , in the county court , the public trial and sentence in the court .
Defendant Zhou Mou was sentenced to three years &apos; imprisonment , four years &apos; probation , and a fine of 3,000 yuan .
In late January 2014 , the company began to build a power grid on the cliffs , trapping more than 20 wild animals , including zebra , muntjac , and woolly deer .
The species is listed as a National Wildlife Refuge and is listed as a National Wildlife Refuge .
During the trial , Zhou confessed to his illegal facts and actions and was willing to bear incidental civil liability .
However , in view of Zhou &apos;s poor economic situation , under the coordination of Baokang County procuratorate , the local village committee , forest station and Zhou Mu reached an agreement to compensate ecological restoration expenses by alternative labor : Zhou Mou provided public services to offset the ecological restoration expenses through the domestication and protection work of the macaque in the village macaque reserve , voluntary mountain patrol and forest protection for one year .
In response to the prosecutor &apos;s recommendation , the court said it accepted Zhou &apos;s execution of the probation , while actively fulfilling &quot; alternative labor to compensate the ecological repair costs &quot; of the obligation .
At present , Zhou Mou has been in the macaque reserve for three months of voluntary labor , active mountain patrol , good performance .
In recent years , Baokang County procuratorate has integrated the procuratorial function and social governance behavior in practice , using scientific supervision methods such as procuratorial advice , investigation supervision and lawsuit supervision to minimize damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts through judicial means .
UN awards Earth Defender Award for &quot; Ant Forest &quot;
To rapturous applause and loud music , Xu Diao , the project leader of Ant Forest and a user representative of Shen Junliang , stepped onto the podium to hand over the 2019 UN Champions of the Earth trophy from the host .
The Ant Forest program , which uses a small program on a cell phone to engage hundreds of millions of people in environmental action , was awarded the &quot; Motivation and Action Award &quot; at the 2019 Champions of the Earth Awards in New York City .
The United Nations Environment Programme announced the winners a week ago at its headquarters in the Kenyan capital , Nairobi , but there was still much excitement at the ceremony .
&quot; The Ant Forest is an exciting innovation that allows hundreds of millions of people to act to understand the environmental challenges that humanity faces and what it can do for the environment , &quot; UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen told Xinhua .
It uses technology to connect people and the environment , allowing every individual to participate in actions to protect the planet , and this will have a huge impact .
Ant Forest was launched in August 2016 on the Alipay platform by China Ant Financial Services Group , where users &quot; plant trees &quot; in their mobile phones by recording their daily green trips , paying online for utilities and other low-carbon actions .
Each time a user develops a virtual tree , an &quot; ant forest &quot; and a pro bono partner plant a real tree in a desertified area .
As of August this year , 500 million &quot; ant forest &quot; users had accumulated carbon reductions of 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas .
Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado praised the &quot; Ant Forest &quot; for its &quot; impressive ability to inspire so many people to take part in green action &quot; .
Ant Gold &apos;s chairman and chief executive , Tian Dong , said the Earth Guardian award was a recognition of the Ant Forest project .
Technology and open platforms make it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life , an honour that belongs to all participants .
The “ ant forest ” has affected 500 million people in the past three years , and the goal for the next three years is to engage 1 billion people around the world in low-carbon action , according to Tou .
While fighting desertification and protecting the environment , they are also exploring how to make farmers earn more from green mountains and waters .
In addition to providing employment opportunities through planting trees , it is hoped to help farmers increase their incomes through agricultural product development projects , electronic business platforms , etc .
The digital technology-based model of environmental protection created by Ant Forest has also been used by other countries .
In June , GCash , the Philippines &quot; largest electronic wallet , launched the Philippine version of &quot; Ant Forest , &quot; encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living .
GCash , together with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines and environmental public interest groups , plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines in the first year of the project , it said .
The Champions of the Earth Award is the highest award of the United Nations in the field of environmental protection and is awarded annually .
&quot; Ant Forest &quot; won the &quot; Inspiration and Action Award &quot; for the third consecutive year for green innovation projects from China , following the &quot; Thousand Village Demonstration and Wancun Improvement Project &quot; by China &apos;s Sai Ham Forest Farm Builders and China &apos;s Zhejiang Province .
Economic and trade frictions affect the U. S. economy &quot; report card &quot; .
The economy &apos;s &quot; report card &quot; for the second quarter of this year showed that gross domestic product growth slowed sharply from the previous quarter , driven by a sharp drop in private-sector investment and exports .
Analysts pointed to economic and trade frictions and the resulting uncertainty as the main reasons for the second quarter &apos;s decline in private sector investment and exports .
The final revision , released by the US Department of Commerce on 26 June , showed that US GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2 % in the second quarter , the same rate as the previous revision , but well below the 3.1 % rate for the first quarter .
Consumption growth was the main factor supporting the US economy in the second quarter , the data showed .
Personal consumption spending , which accounts for about 70 % of the US economy , grew by 4.6 % in the quarter , boosting growth by 3.03 percentage points .
In addition , government consumer spending and investment led the economy by 0.82 percentage point .
However , private sector investment slid 6.3 % in the second quarter from the previous quarter , dragging the economy up 1.16 percentage points in the current quarter , and exports fell 5.7 % from the previous quarter , dragging net exports down 0.68 percentage points .
Barry Knapp , managing partner at Ainslie Macroeconomic Consulting , said private sector investment had not only failed to keep up with last year &apos;s growth , but had fallen sharply as trade frictions and rising uncertainty hit business confidence .
Mr Knapp believes that US corporate capital spending is expected to remain on the downside next year amid policy uncertainty .
Analysts believe that while consumption growth has been a strong support for the US economy in the second quarter , there is growing evidence that economic and trade frictions and the resulting uncertainty have dented consumer confidence and adversely affected the US consumer outlook .
In a recent survey , 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy , a year-and-a-half high , University of Michigan economics professor Richard Curtin said .
For the future of the U. S. economy , analysts generally believe that the U. S. economy will continue to slow .
But some experts say both the U. S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve if economic and trade frictions are eased .
Kathleen Birch , global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit , expects the US economy to continue its gradual decline this year , with growth slowing to a slower pace than in the second quarter .
Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’ s Analytics , predicts that the US economy will grow by 2.3 % this year , assuming economic and trade frictions do not escalate , and will slow further to 1.6 % next year .
Ellen Hatzen , investment manager at Putnam Investments , said the biggest corporate concern at the moment is economic and trade disputes and the uncertainty they bring .
&apos;Economic and trade frictions are still the number one issue and the main cause of this year &apos;s volatility in U.S. capital markets , &apos; said Matt Mellor , equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management .
Ningxia initiates joint parental leave of 10 days per year for parents of children aged 0 to 3 years
The protection of women &apos;s legitimate rights and interests embodies respect for and protection of human rights , and is also an important symbol of social civilization and progress .
On September 27 , at the 15th Session of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People &apos;s Congress of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region , the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were adopted by a high vote .
This is the first local regulation on the comprehensive and systematic protection of women &apos;s legal rights and interests to be enacted by the provincial government in Ningxia , and will be implemented officially from November 1 , 2019 .
It is understood that the Regulations were revised on the basis of the Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People &apos;s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in Ningxia in 2007 , which is divided into 9 chapters and 65 articles , including general provisions , political rights , rights and interests in culture and education , rights and interests in labor and social security , rights and interests in property , personal rights , rights in marriage and family , legal responsibilities and supplementary regulations .
In the Regulations , Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave , which was the first in China .
In April this year , the Guidance on Promoting the Development of Care Services for Children under the age of 3 , issued by the General Office of the State Council , contained a description of joint parenting .
In the course of revising the Regulations , Ningxia has innovated and put forward the idea of &quot; encouraging employers to grant couples with children , in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations , ten days of joint parental leave every year for the period of zero to three years . &quot;
At the same time , the regulations highlight the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors .
Article 43 of the Regulations , which incorporates the latest legislative developments in China &apos;s current Civil Code on personal status , details the constituent elements of sexual harassment and the main body and mechanism for combating it .
Article 44 of the Ordinance expressly prohibits the frequent sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to carry out education , protection and prevention , which is a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation .
With regard to women &apos;s right to know and dispose of the joint property of marriage and family , article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates women &apos;s right to know about the joint property and the obligations of property registration agencies and related subjects , thus providing solid institutional support for women &apos;s right to defend their rights .
Moreover , in response to a topical social issue of gender discrimination in employment , article 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct but also indirect discrimination , and draws on recent experience in the practice of joint interviews to strengthen sanctions for gender discrimination violations and strengthen the defence of women &apos;s legitimate rights and interests .
In recent years , the Ningxia Women &apos;s Federation &apos;s Joint Department of Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office , Civil Affairs and other departments have made remarkable achievements in promoting and introducing specialized social forces to participate in the mediation of marital and family disputes and the anti-domestic violence work .
This is summarized in the Regulations , which encourage the mobilization of social forces and the pooling of social resources for the protection of women &apos;s rights and interests , and require the people &apos;s governments at and above the county level to provide stable , institutional protection and support through , for example , the purchase of services .
Inner Mongolia Xing UNITA Academician Yuan Longping workstation salt tolerance alkali paddy paddy per mu paddy beer
Reporter 27 from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Xing UNITA administration office has been informed that the &quot; Xing UNITA Yuan Longping Academician Workstation Salt-tolerant Rice Site Inspection and Acceptance Council &quot; on the good news , the average salt-tolerant rice paddy production per mu over 1000 jin .
A team of six experts from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Heilongjiang Province , Yangzhou University , and the Hunan Agricultural and Rural Department collected samples of rice for harvesting .
Expert assessment shows that salt-tolerant rice yields 508.8 kg on average per mu on land with a pH of 8.8 to 9.6 and a salinity of 5 to 6 per thousand .
&quot; The next step is to innovate and reform the salt-tolerant rice varieties on the basis of this year &apos;s experiment , &quot; said Wang Shigang , executive station director of Xingda &apos;s Yuan Longping Academician Station .
Laiyongcai , vice president and researcher of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences , who headed the expert group , said , &quot; On the premise that the factors of production will not change , I think that continuous strengthening of scientific and technological efforts to solve the problem , saline and alkaline rice will continue to produce miracles on saline and alkaline land . &quot;
Xing UNITA belongs to the special hardship area of the southern foothills of the Daxing &apos;an Mountains .
In October 2018 , the work station of Academician Yuan Longping was unveiled by UNITA .
Prof. Yuan Longping led a team of experts to speed up the introduction and popularization of the latest varieties and advanced technologies of &quot; salt-tolerant hybrid rice &quot; , and to build a 960 mu saline-tolerant rice base in the center-right wing of Horqin .
This field test of salt-tolerant rice not only provides the hope for the promotion of salt-tolerant low- and medium-yield fields to the low- and medium-yield fields , but also provides the scientific basis for the cultivation of saline-alkaline rice under the same conditions in China .

Liu Kun was by the Ministry of Finance , the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security , the SASAC jointly convened on the same day a partial transfer of state-owned capital to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund at the deployment meeting made the above statement .
&quot; Transferring part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system , a full reflection of the achievements of state-owned enterprises and the fairness between generations in the basic old-age insurance system , as well as an immediate and long-term policy measure . &quot;
In 2017 , the State Council issued the Program for the Transfer of Partial State-Owned Capital to the Social Security Fund , requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out the pilot program .
According to Liu Kun , the transfer of the previous work has achieved positive results .
At the central level , a total of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have been transferred in three batches , with a total of 8601 million yuan of state-owned capital transferred .
Among them , the transfer of the central financial institutions in which the Ministry of Finance performs the functions of investors has been completed .
The transfer of central enterprises has a certain scale .
At the local level , the pre-transfer work of enterprises has been carried out one after another .
By the end of 2018 , Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had completed their pilot projects , transferring their state-owned capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively .
In addition to the pilot provinces , other provinces have also carried out the preparatory work for the next phase of the transfer , laying the foundation for the next phase of the transfer .
According to a circular issued recently by the Ministry of Finance , the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security , the SASAC , the State Administration of Taxation , and the CSRC , the transfer of part of the state-owned capital from the central and local governments to the SSSF will be fully extended by 2019 and basically completed by the end of 2020 .
The meeting that took place on that day made concrete arrangements for the full pullout of the transfer .
It was emphasized that the transfer process should be completed in a pragmatic and efficient manner .
&quot; According to the schedule , the transfer should be substantially completed by the end of 2020 .
Shift work time is tight , the task is heavy .
&apos;All regions and departments should carefully organize and make careful arrangements to ensure that the transfer is completed as required , &apos; Mr. Liu said .
The transfer of state funds to enlarge the Social Security Fund – the starting point for “ enlarge the purse strings of the Social Security Fund ” – is intended to provide strong support for pension protection .
However , I believe that this is not a simple equity &quot; physical displacement &quot; , but the opening of the &quot; mathematical addition . &quot;
On September 20 , the Ministry of Finance , the Ministry of Human Services , the SASAC , the State Administration of Taxation , and the CSRC jointly issued the &quot; Notice on the Comprehensive Pushing Out and Transferring of Part of the State-Owned Capital to Enrich the Work of the Social Security Fund &quot; , clarifying the timetable for the transfer of State-owned capital to the Social Security Fund , i.e. the transfer of part of the State-owned capital from the central and local governments to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund in 2019 .
After the document was published , the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented it quickly .
On September 25 , the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 % of the shares of ICBC and Agribank to the Social Security Fund , with the total value of the two transfers exceeding 115 billion yuan .
According to the regulation , the undertaker such as the social security foundation , as a financial investor , enjoys the right of profit , disposition and right to know .
ICBC , the Agricultural Bank in the notice said that this change in rights and interests will not lead to changes in the Bank &apos;s controlling shareholders and actual controllers .
In this respect , the author believes that similar transfer of equity of state-owned enterprises is not a simple change of ownership , but an &quot; addition operation &quot; that can stimulate a series of effects .
The first step of transferring some of the state funds to social security is to &quot; add law results &quot; , which can naturally reflect the state-owned enterprises owned by the whole people , and the fruits of development are shared by all .
After many years of reform and development , the state-owned enterprises , especially the Central Enterprise , are mostly in important industries and fields in our economy , and their overall profitability is strong and stable .
Among them , the leading enterprise is to continue to do good and to be strong .
On July 10 , the executive meeting of the State Council decided that this year the transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the work of the Social Security Fund should be pushed aside .
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it would , in conjunction with relevant departments , in accordance with the arrangements of the executive meeting of the State Council , do a good job of comprehensively pushing aside and transferring part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund , fully reflecting the basic old-age insurance system of intergenerational fairness and the sharing of the fruits of the development of state-owned enterprises .
The second step of transfer &quot; addition result &quot; is to enhance the sustainability of China &apos;s social security fund and further strengthen the foundation of old-age social security system .
With the aging of the population , China &apos;s social security funds are under pressure , and as the transfer of the main national capital , most of the sustainable profitability and dividend capacity , not only can effectively replenish the Social Security Fund , but also provide a source of funds for the Social Security Fund .
Calculations show that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred , the proportion of contributions to basic old-age insurance for enterprises can be reduced by 1 percentage point .
The third step of the rotation , the &quot; addition result , &quot; is to add stabilizers for the capital markets .
The main body of this transfer to gain the way is &quot; dividends for the main , operation for the auxiliary . &quot;
As a financial investor of state-owned capital , the social security fund is really based on the return of share dividends .
However , as a value investor in the capital market , the Social Security Fund has a strong capacity for capital operation .
For the listed assets in the state capital , the participation of social security funds in the shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of the listed enterprises , which will help to enhance the operation level of the enterprises and have a positive impact on the listed companies and the capital market .
At the same time , as a vane of investment , the increase of shareholding weights will further enhance its influence in the market and act as a &quot; stabilizer &quot; in the market .
In addition , it is conducive to give full play to the &quot; value discovery &quot; function of institutional investors , guide investors rational investment , value investment .

Iran confirms development of advanced centrifuges , further suspending implementation of Iran nuclear deal
The United Nations &apos; International Atomic Energy Agency said on Thursday that Iran had violated the Iran nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium .
Iran is reportedly gradually violating the limits of the Iran nuclear deal in response to US President Donald Trump ’ s withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 , and to the renewal and strengthening of sanctions against Iran .
Further moves have been made by Iran , which suspended two other commitments in July to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and its purity of no more than 3.67 % .
Under the nuclear deal , Iran is allowed to place only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz to accumulate uranium , and only a small number of more advanced models for research but not for production .
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges , it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster , possibly for use in making nuclear bombs .

China &apos;s development is an opportunity for the world , not a threat or a challenge .
) White Paper : China &apos;s development is an opportunity for the world , not a threat or a challenge .
The white paper says China &apos;s development is an opportunity for the world , not a threat or a challenge .
&apos;With China &apos;s overall national strength and international influence growing rapidly , there is international concern that China will follow the path of &apos; national strongman &apos; , &apos; the white paper said .
This is a combination of cognitive misreading , deep-rooted biases , psychological imbalances brought about by power deceleration , and deliberate distortions to safeguard one ’ s own vested interests .
It is not only the dream of the Chinese people but also the common dream of people of all countries to realize the prosperity of the country , the rejuvenation of the nation and the happiness of the people .
&quot; China &apos;s development is an opportunity for the world , not a threat or a challenge .
The white paper said that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth , that China is the largest contributor to world economic growth , and that China &apos;s scientific and technological innovation has injected new kinetic energy into world economic growth .
At present , the world economy is not growing fast enough , and a sound Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world .
China &apos;s economy is turning from rapid growth to high-quality development.New forms of industrialization , informationization , urbanization , and agricultural modernization are being advanced at an accelerated pace .
“ According to the McKinsey Global Institute study , by 2040 , the integration of China and the rest of the world ’ s economies is expected to create between $ 22 trillion and $ 37 trillion in economic value , equivalent to 15-26 % of the global economy , and greater cooperation between the rest of the world and China will create significant economic value . ”
The white paper stresses that China &apos;s economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated .
A China with a more stable economic performance , higher quality of growth and predictable growth prospects is good for the world economy in the long run .
Viewing China &apos;s economic development as a &quot; threat &quot; and a &quot; challenge &quot; and trying to push China out of the global industrial chain , supply chain or value chain so as to &quot; decouple &quot; China from the world economy is neither feasible nor harmful .
The white paper says opening up to the outside world will create more opportunities for countries to share in China &apos;s dividend .
China will unswervingly pursue a win-win strategy of opening-up , achieve greater intensity and achieve a higher level of opening-up , have the most potential consumer market in the world , be the most attractive destination for investment , and benefit more countries by “ going abroad ” on a larger scale .
&quot; Openness should be two-way , mutually beneficial , not one-way , one-way beneficial .
Mutual benefit and mutual benefit make it long lasting .
The white paper says China is committed to continued import expansion , market access liberalization , improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection .
Only when all sides meet side by side can we create an environment of open , inclusive , inclusive , balanced and win-win development , in which the &quot; cake &quot; of development will grow bigger and bigger together , forming a community of interests for mutual benefit and win-win results .
The white paper says China is providing more public goods to the international community .
It includes promoting high-quality joint building of the &quot; One Belt , One Road &quot; , setting up multilateral platforms for dialogue and cooperation , actively participating in international and regional affairs , and actively engaging in foreign assistance .
&quot; China benefits from the international community in its development and always keeps in mind to give back to the international community and provide it with more and better public goods . &quot;
Andrei Slepniov , the general manager of the Russian export center , told Xinhua in a written interview that Russia is ready to strengthen economic and trade cooperation with China , further optimize export structure and promote diversified Russian exports to China .
He pointed out that forestry , machinery manufacturing and chemical industry account for a large proportion of Russia &apos;s exports to China , while the export of agricultural products is also very important , including not only grease products , meat products and dairy products , but also cereals , fish and seafood .
In recent years , Russian exports to China of non-raw materials and non-energy products have also shown good and stable development .
Talking about optimizing Russia &apos;s export structure to China , Mr Slipniov said Russia had set the task of expanding the export of high-tech products to meet the import demand of countries and regions in the world , including China .
Russia will then improve financial and non-financial support measures to promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises .
He said Russia is willing to export construction technology and hi-tech building materials to China and develop cooperation with China in medicine , aviation and other fields .
Russia and China also have a great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development .
He stressed that Russian products in many areas &quot; have the advantage of quality and are competitive in price &quot; compared with similar Western products .
Referring to the two countries &apos; goal of achieving a $ 200 billion bilateral trade volume by 2024 , Slepniov said that areas such as agriculture , machinery manufacturing , chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving this goal .
The Russian side intends to promote the diversification of supply in these areas and the export of highly processed products .
He stressed that Russia intended to push its exporters into the global value added chain , with China as one of the directions .
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture , metallurgy , oil and gas , and chemicals are well positioned to participate in this process .
At present , the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises and &quot; set up more Russian-Chinese joint ventures to jointly develop exports to third countries . &quot;
The Russian export center is supporting the export of Russian products to China through various measures and services provided by the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Administration and the Russian Export-Import Bank , he said .
At the same time , the Russian export center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments to promote easier access of Russian goods to the Chinese market and the development of new categories of export products to China .

Foreign Ministry responds to Taiwan &apos;s alleged &quot; diplomatic breakthrough &quot; by sneaking away
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular press conference that the move was disgraceful and made him laugh .
The Taipei office in New York has entered the United Nations headquarters to attend a meeting on religious issues held in the United States , which it described as a &quot; diplomatic breakthrough , &quot; Taiwanese media reported .

Demonstrations as president steps down in Egypt as authorities demonstrate crackdown
The Twitter-themed hashtag and social media are pushing hard for Egyptians to take to the streets today to peacefully call for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to step down .
But the authorities have made it clear that they intend to use force to crack down .
Ever since el-Sissi , the military chief at the time , seized power in a military coup in 2013 , expression of dissent has virtually disappeared in Egypt , and any form of protest would be extremely dangerous .
The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights , a Cairo NGO , says more than 1,900 people have been arrested since the weekend &apos;s rare outburst of protests calling for el-Sissi to step down , the Guardian reported .
Allegations of corruption surrounding Sisi and his family &apos;s lavish spending of public money in pursuit of vanity caused thousands of people to take to the streets in protest on the 20th .
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior stood firm yesterday and said it would not relent in confronting any attempt to destabilize the country .
The center of Cairo has long been heavily guarded , with riot police , security agency vehicles , and plain-clothes police on the streets surrounding Tahrir Square , the site of Egypt ’ s 2011 revolution .
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of prominent academics and social leaders , including Nafa , a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist .
He tweeted on the 24th : &quot; There is no doubt in my mind that the continuation of Selasi &apos;s absolute rule will be disastrous . &quot;
&quot; It is in Egypt &apos;s interest that he step down immediately , &quot; he said .
Prior to Nafa &apos;s arrest , Hosny , a former Egyptian military chief of staff , was detained .
Anan was arrested last year after trying to contest the presidency with Sisi .
The chairman of the Constitution Party , Dawud , was also taken into custody .
Analysts and politicians argue that , at a time of increasing economic hardship for the poor and the middle class , sweeping away dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of government .
Opposition leader Ayman Nour , a former presidential contender , said : “ The capture highlights the regime ’ s disregard for the Egyptian people and how fearful it is of itself . ”
&quot; Because the economy has been in such a mess by him , coupled with widespread political repression , Sisi is trying to send a clear message to the key generals and politicians who might replace him . &quot;
Knoll said the government &apos;s heavy-handed approach would only increase anger in the face of a deteriorating socio-economic situation .
Now that the fear barrier has been breached , he expects more people to take to the streets .
Ali , a businessman and actor in exile in Spain and a former construction contractor for the Egyptian military , started posting a series of videos earlier this month in which he profited from government corruption , setting off a wave of small-scale demonstrations in various cities over the weekend .
Ali said his company , Amrak General Contracting , could get lucrative contracts without having to go through the legal tender process , stressing the corruption of the military and Sisi relatives , including the first lady , Intisar Amer al-Sisi .
He was deeply remorseful for his part in it .
Ali claimed that the grandeur of the palaces and luxury hotels that he helped Cecil was in stark contrast to the abject poverty in which Egyptians now live , and for which they had yet to pay .
On Twitter , hashtags such as &quot; Stand Up You &apos;re Not Alone &quot; , &quot; Ceci You &apos;re Failed &quot; , &quot; Ceci Get Out &quot; , and &quot; Next Friday &quot; have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets calling for people to peacefully take to the streets to demand Ceci &apos;s resignation .
The tweet from Hollywood Egyptian actor Almavik has nearly seven million followers .
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday : &quot; Selasi is doomed . . . he is finished . The people who support him are going to make a big mistake now . &quot;

Mr Yu Pengchun , Chairman of the Employees Retraining Board , said that all course fees were free and the scheme was expected to support about 10,000 people in need .
Participants are entitled to a special allowance of up to HK $ 4,000 per month for each full-time or part-time course in which 80 per cent of the participants attend .
According to the report , the training course lasts two to three months and is offered by about 50 training institutions . It can be read daily from 3 October to 31 March next year , with a maximum of four courses per person .
The HKSAR Government has also announced a series of measures to support the tourism industry to tide it over difficulties .
These include relaxing the grant to the Travel Industry Council , subsidising 6000 tour guides to renew their applications for courses , and waiving annual fees for travel agents .

Part of the problem , INSEP asks , is nerve fatigue , the kind caused by excessive mental effort .
The study was published in the journal Current Biology .

Two UHV Projects Delivered &quot; One Crossing All the Way &quot;
On 26 May , the project was put into operation , starting from approximately ± 1100 kV south of Anhui and terminating at 1000 kV Su Tong AC and 1100 kV GIL GIL .
Both of these projects occupy the high points of the current world transmission technology , which will greatly improve the energy distribution in our country .
Guo Zhi , chief economist of the National Energy Bureau , said the Qidong to Anhui project is the world &apos;s largest power transmission capacity , the longest transmission distance .
Its delivery is of great significance for promoting the development of Xinjiang energy base and ensuring the power supply in east China .
GIL , or gas-insulated metal closed transmission lines .
The Soutong Corridor project , which set the record for the highest voltage level and best transmission capacity in the world for the GIL project , achieved the &apos; AC Double Loop &apos; combined operation of the highest voltage level for the backbone network in eastern China .
According to the State Grid Corporation , the transmission distance of the project is 3,324 km .
If conventional technology is used , more than 15 % of the electricity will be lost in transit , and the project has been studied and developed , greatly increasing the economic transmission distance to over 3,000 km .
After the project is put into operation in the east to the south of Anhui , it can deliver 100 million degrees of electric energy every 8 hours and 20 minutes , which can help to solve the problem of the extinction of the existing new energy sources in Xinjiang .
According to the full load estimates , this line alone would generate 60 to 85 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually , enough to meet more than half of Shanghai &apos;s annual electricity demand .
The Soutong GIL Integrated Tube Corridor Project is a control project of the UHV AC ring network across the Yangtze River .
A conventional overhead line across the river would require the erection of two gigantic towers more than 450 metres across the Yangtze River and the construction of an artificial island the size of more than four football fields for each tower .
In response , the National Grid ventured to innovate , developing compact ultra-high-voltage AC GIL transmission technology that would pass under a river through a tunnel , avoiding the impact on the Golden Passage .
Two projects to promote the electrical equipment manufacturing capacity of our country to achieve a new leap .
At present , the National Grid has a total of &quot; 10 interchanges 11 straight &quot; ultra-high-voltage projects , as well as &quot; 4 interchanges 3 straight &quot; under construction .
Foreign exchange bureau : the structure of China &apos;s foreign debt continued to optimize the stability of foreign debt
&quot; Overall , China &apos;s external debt structure continued to optimize , the stability of foreign debt increased . &quot;
China &apos;s main indicators of foreign debt are within the internationally recognized security line and the risk of foreign debt is under general control , said Wang Chunying , a spokesman for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ) and a chief economist .

In the second quarter of 2019 , more than 70 % of the increase in China &apos;s full-caliber foreign debt was driven by the purchase of domestic renminbi bonds by non-residents , who were mainly medium- and long-term investors such as the central bank .
By the end of June 2019 , medium- and long-term foreign debt had increased by 3 percentage points compared to the end of March 2019 , and foreign debt in local currency had increased by 1 percentage point compared to the end of March 2019 .
&apos;With the inclusion of domestic RMBS bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index in April 2019 , international investor acceptance of China &apos;s bond market has further increased and domestic RMBS bonds continue to be held , &apos; Wang said .
&quot; China &apos;s balance of payments is in general equilibrium , and the risk of foreign debt can be controlled . &quot;

Consultation on the new regulations : social capital to acquire rural land management rights to be qualified
Social Capital Acquire Rural Land Management Rights to Be Qualified
&quot; Measures on the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights &quot; to be published for consultation and to supervise the transfer of social capital , such as industrial and commercial enterprises , to acquire the right to manage land
Yesterday , the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published a notice on the &quot; Measures on the Management of the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights ( Draft for Exposure to Exposure ) &quot; ( hereinafter referred to as the &quot; Draft Opinion &quot; ) to solicit public comments , adding supervision and risk prevention for the acquisition of land management rights by businesses and other social capital transfers .
The draft of the Opinions is now open for public consultation .
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development , in order to implement the newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting , further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system , deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the &quot; division of three powers &quot; system , the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the &quot; Measures on the Transfer and Management of Rural Land Contracting Rights &quot; , resulting in the &quot; Opinions &quot; .
Beijing Youth Daily reporters learned that the first published &quot; Opinions &quot; have a number of important changes .
The newly revised Law on Rural Land Contracting clarifies the scope of land transfer , implements the concept of &quot; division of three rights &quot; , establishes separate sections on &quot; land contracting and management rights &quot; and makes a clear distinction between the transfer of land contracting and management rights and the transfer of land management rights ( through leasing , subcontracting , share ownership or other means ) .
In order to implement the concept of &quot; division of the three powers &quot; and effectively respond to the main points of the Law on the revision of the Law on Rural Land Contracting , and taking into account the fact that the transfer of land management rights and the exchange of land management rights are quite different in terms of the parties involved , procedures and supervision , the revised Draft defined the scope of the transfer of land management rights , focusing on the transfer of land management rights in the form of leasing , stock ownership , etc . , and changed the name of the Regulation from &quot; Measures for the Administration of the Transfer of Rural Land Contract Management Rights &quot; to &quot; Measures for the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights &quot; .
The transfer and exchange of land contract management right will be separately regulated .
The draft notes that , in the context of the &quot; division of three powers &quot; , farmers only own shares in the land for a limited period of time .
Theoretically , there is no longer any legal need to return the contracted land to the original contractor , but there is also a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law .
Aiming at the problem of preventing the risk of peasants losing their land , the practice has produced the methods of preferred shares , lease shares first , buy back , and so on .
Considering that the preferred shares have been discussed in the company law , it is suggested that it should be used as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of losing land .
